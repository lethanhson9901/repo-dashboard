      "text": "I tested several model combinations in Kilo Code. Before the release of GLM 4.7, I mainly used Gemini 3 Flash for all modes, with solid results. I was highly enthusiastic about the release of GLM, but after many cycles of fixing bug after bug, it became clear that GLM 4.7 was not on par with Gemini in terms of architecture. Gemini was able to produce a functional prototype with just a few iterations.\n\nHowever, since GLM 4.7 is significantly more economical, especially with its API subscription plan, I tested a configuration that proves very effective: Gemini 3 Flash for all modes except code, where GLM 4.7 performs perfectly. For small feature architecture, Gemini 3 Flash is sufficient. For full project architecture or large features, I switch to Opus 4.5, but costs escalate rapidly.",

It seems to be the consensus that while GLM 4.7 is a very intelligent model, it goes off the rails in longer multi turn context sessions and breaks stuff / hallucinates. Have you tried Minimax M2. 1 yet? I used M2 for a while and was impressed with how well it could stay on task even over long context. It's great at instruction following and tool calling.

Basically, use a [`plan.md`](http://plan.md) or [`todo.md`](http://todo.md) file style pattern and have the cloud agent do incremental work. \n\nThe other thing to be aware of is that the cloud agent version of the cli runs in auto/yolo mode.

They pick the model, they decide when to upgrade, and you get whatever they’ve configured. \n\nOn the other hand, code reviews in Kilo are built on a different premise. \n\nSo, how does Kilo Code reveiws stack against CodeRabbit? \n\n**Pricing**\n\nCodeRabbit charges $24 per seat per month for code reviews only.\n\nKilo works on per-token pricing at the cost set by model providers. You pay for the reviews you run, which means you don’t leave money on the table, and you don’t hit invisible rate limits or downgrades when you surpass an arbitrary usage limit.\n\n**Workflow**  \n  \nCodeRabbit is a standalone code review product. It does one thing, and you add it to your existing pile of dev tools.\n\nKilo’s Code Reviews is part of the Kilo platform, the same environment where you’re already writing code, debugging, and deploying. Your reviews happen alongside: \n\n* Agentic Engineering with specialized modes for implementation, architecture, debugging, and orchestration in the IDE or CLI\n* Cloud Agents for accessing Kilo without using your local machine\n* App Builder for prototyping with a live preview\n* Kilo Sessions that sync across VS Code, JetBrains, CLI, and web\n* Kilo Deploy for one-click shipping when the review passes\n* Managed Indexing for context-aware reviews that understand your codebase \n\nIf anyone’s interested, here’s a **more detailed breakdown and comparison**:  \n[https://blog.kilo.ai/p/code-review-alternative-2026]() \n\nQuestion: Anyone who’s tried multiple AI code review tools, what turned out to matter, and what was mostly noise?",

There are a few ways to account for those guardrails:\n\n1. **Strictness Levels** \\- You can pick between Strict, Balanced, and Lenient review styles depending on your use case. Strict flags everything (good for production hotfixes), Balanced surfaces what matters without noise, and Lenient is a light touch for WIP branches.\n2. **Focus Areas** \\- You can choose which categories the review focuses on: security, performance, bugs, code style, test coverage, documentation. So if you don't want style nitpicks, just turn that off.\n3. **Custom Instructions** \\- You can add context about your codebase conventions, so the agent knows what's intentional vs. what's actually worth flagging.\n4. **Model Selection** \\- Different models have different reasoning styles. Some are more conservative, some more thorough. You can experiment to find what fits your team's tolerance.",

I tend to think having Gemini 3 thinking and GPT 5.2 High \"reviewing\" is a good thing because it gives my code a different review perspective. I then typically take the long response GPT or Gemini give, feed it back in to Claude with the \"I had an independent team review what we've done and this is what they had to say about it. Take their responses and re-analyze the project with what they said and give me an updated review..\". Something like that.\n\nI am not an expert coder (not these days.. getting old).. but most of what I read from responses, apply the fixes (I do go through most of the suggestions and often have multiple rounds of \"What does this do\" and \"eli5 this bit of code\", etc.. before I have a final work plan.\n\nAnyone else do this? If so.. what are your results? Are you seeing it get more accurate/better overall coding results? Architecture, etc?\n\nIs there any \"magic\" I might be missing to utilize this approach to try to get the absolute best coding out of Opus? ",

This screenshot shows the **average cost per Claude request** before and after our recent update.\n\nIn earlier Kilo Code versions, Claude requests were more expensive because the tool's results weren’t cached efficiently. In the newer version, we improved API call caching, which significantly reduced the average cost per request.  \nI would recommend upgrading and giving it a try ;)",

I think it's popular atm, cause they give you 20,-  free when you purchase 10,- on tokens.  You can also be a bit creative with your models.  Kilo uses modi, you have a coding mode, an architect mode, an asking mode etc.  and not all modi require the most expenive model. IF you can tune that right, you can get a lot of work done, for less money. \n\nF.i. right now, i'm playing with local models to assist in simple boring jobs to further reduce costs. For me, that's fun to do, others might consider it to complicated, but to each his own.",

No matter what the marketing claims a 2.6B parameter model is not going to be good enough for most coding tasks or comparable to GPT-4, and it looks like it's failing to execute tool calls correctly. The context window for that model is fairly limited and you are likely using a quantized (dumber) version as well. You *might* get some use out of it by switching from XML to JSON/native tool calling or vice versa, but chances are it's not going to work well. You really need at least a 24B parameter model like Devstral 2 or larger like Qwen 3 Coder 30B A3B for agentic coding, ideally bigger and smarter. If you don't have powerful enough hardware you can get good models for cheap or even free through a variety of providers including synthetic, openrouter, or minimax. Minimax M2 model is currently free on open router and would work better, or even Grok Code Fast 1 which is also free I believe.",

For musicians who think in multiple time signatures. Layer 7/8 over 5/4, customize sounds, make patterns that would confuse most drummers.\n\n🥉 Third Place: Triple Town-ish by Keith Hall. A merge puzzle game on a 6×6 grid. The kind you open \"for a minute\" and suddenly it's 3am.\n\nThere's still an Honorable Mention prize ($150 in credits) up for grabs.

      "text": "I've been thinking about why some teams see massive gains from AI while others get... incremental improvements at best.\n\nThe pattern I keep seeing: teams take their 2019-era processes—same standups, same PR cycles, same team structures—and just add AI tools on top. Copilot here, ChatGPT there, maybe an AI summarizer for meetings.\n\nI call this \"peanut buttering\" AI. Spreading it thin across everything, changing nothing fundamental.\n\n**Why this doesn't work**\n\nDeterministic tools (linters, build systems, code quality tools) *can* be incrementally adopted. You add them to your existing workflow and get marginal benefit. That's fine.\n\nAI is different. It's non-deterministic. The same input doesn't guarantee the same output. It requires a fundamentally different operating model—breaking problems into AI-tractable pieces, managing context across sessions, knowing when to verify output vs. trust it.\n\nWhen you peanut butter AI onto existing processes, you get peanut butter results.\n\n**What transformation actually looks like**\n\nAt Kilo, we ship \\~3 major features per week. The old model would be 3 engineers collaborating on a feature—dividing work, writing code, reviewing PRs, syncing in standups.\n\nOur model: one engineer owns the feature end-to-end. They direct AI agents:\n\n* Architect Agent for design\n* Orchestrator Agent to break up tasks\n* Code Agent to build\n* Debug Agent for troubleshooting\n* AI Code Reviewer for PRs\n\nThe engineer focuses on architecture, edge cases, and verification. The AI handles implementation.\n\n**Concrete example**\n\nEngineer Evgeny: applied on weekend, hired Wednesday, started Monday. First commit Monday, first demo Tuesday, working MVP Friday. Feature (App Builder) went GA two weeks later.\n\nNot because he's superhuman. Because the system is designed for single-engineer ownership.\n\n**The Unix parallel**\n\nGuillermo Rauch pointed out that effective agentic coding follows the Unix philosophy:\n\n* Modularity: simple parts, clean interfaces\n* Clarity over cleverness\n* Composition: programs designed to connect to other programs\n* Simplicity: add complexity only where you must\n\nThe human becomes architect and reviewer. The AI becomes implementer. But you have to design for that model.\n\n**Signs you're peanut buttering:**\n\n* AI adoption is tool-by-tool, no coherent strategy\n* Team structures unchanged\n* Measuring \"adoption\" by license count\n* AI used on the side, not in work planning\n\n**Signs you're transforming:**\n\n* Asking what work is now possible that wasn't before\n* Engineers owning larger scopes\n* Building org capabilities, not just buying tools\n* Productivity metrics have changed\n\nFull post with more detail on the Zapier fluency framework and what this means for both engineers and leaders: [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/stop-peanut-buttering-ai](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/stop-peanut-buttering-ai)\n\nCurious what approaches others are taking. Are your orgs stuck in peanut butter mode? What's worked (or not worked) for shifting to a more transformative model?",

      "text": "How  about prompt HARDENING ? !\n\n    AI Agents are powerful autonomous systems capable of executing complex tasks, writing code, managing files, making API calls, and orchestrating multi-step workflows. They operate by interpreting instructions and executing them to completion.\n    \n    **Critical Understanding**: AI Agents are not your collaborators during execution. Even the most capable agent operates under rules of literal interpretation. An agent's primary obligation is to fulfill the **exact instructions** of your prompt, not your **unstated intent**. This fundamental truth is the basis for everything in this guide.\n    \n    **The Agent's Execution Model**: AI Agents will:\n    - Take the most direct path to completion (not necessarily the best path)\n    - Fill gaps in your instructions with assumptions (often wrong ones)\n    - Optimize for task completion, not quality or safety unless specified\n    - Execute literally what you said, not what you meant\n    - Continue executing even when encountering unexpected states\n    \n    **Assume the worst. Prepare for an agent that will find every ambiguity, take every shortcut, and exploit every gap in your instructions—not maliciously, but through pure literal interpretation.**\n\nworks especially nice with minimax 2.1, you are welcome to invent more and iterate  \nThe idea is the models are shortcut finding masters, so ....   \n\n\n\\#####  \nYou are a military-grade AI Prompt Hardener. Your only job is to take a loose, vague, dangerous or under-specified user prompt and transform it into an extremely precise, scope-locked, safety-wrapped, ambiguity-free instruction optimized for autonomous AI agents or code-writing LLMs.\n\nFollow these mandatory transformation rules — in strict priority order:\n\n1. \\*\\*Intent first\\*\\* — always start with clear one-sentence goal + business/engineering why\n2. \\*\\*Scope fortress\\*\\* — explicitly list: ONLY files/modules allowed to change + long explicit \"DO NOT MODIFY / DO NOT TOUCH\" list\n3. \\*\\*Harm prohibition\\*\\* — hard \"DO NOT\" list: no security holes, no data loss, no external calls, no new dependencies (unless explicitly allowed), no breaking changes, no test breakage, no logging secrets\n4. \\*\\*Preservation lock\\*\\* — must preserve: existing behavior, public APIs, function signatures, test passage, API contracts\n5. \\*\\*Quality floor\\*\\* — force: input validation, error handling strategy per type, logging (non-sensitive), unit tests ≥80%, documentation, no magic numbers\n6. \\*\\*Edge-case & failure mode wall\\*\\* — enumerate critical edge cases + exact desired behavior for each\n7. \\*\\*Ambiguity kill-switch\\*\\* — when in doubt clause: resolve ambiguity toward max security > correctness > maintainability > minimal change; if high-stakes uncertainty → MUST ask instead of assume\n8. \\*\\*Definition of done\\*\\* — end with concrete, testable acceptance criteria + verification checklist\n9. \\*\\*Structure\\*\\* — use clear markdown headings: INTENT, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS, FORBIDDEN, REQUIREMENTS, EDGE CASES, ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, WHEN IN DOUBT\n\nOutput style rules:\n\n• Short, dense, bullet-point & table heavy\n\n• Zero fluff, no apologies, no meta-commentary\n\n• Never weaken constraints — only strengthen them\n\n• If original prompt is already very precise → still add safety rails & explicit boundaries\n\nNever execute the task yourself. Only output the hardened prompt.\n\nUser's original prompt: « ${userInput}  »\n\nNow produce the hardened version:\n\n\\#####",

The entire codebase of Kilo takes about 6 hours with 8B, 2/3 of that with 4B for reference and is plenty fast to keep up with agentic coding against it.\n\nAlso what Liga suggested. If you want to see \"wire speed\" use  LanceDB as the vector database. Thats where my measurements come from.",
