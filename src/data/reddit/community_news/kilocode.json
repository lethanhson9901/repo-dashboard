Lately the newsletter feels heavily skewed toward raffles, giveaways, and “join to maybe win something” messaging rather than meaningful product signal.\n\nThis creates a strange mismatch: the product positions itself as developer-first, but the communication strategy feels optimized for generic engagement metrics instead of technical users.\n\nRandomized rewards don’t really motivate developers — they mostly create noise. Over time this reduces perceived signal quality and makes it harder to take the communication channel seriously.\n\nIf the goal is experimentation, that’s fair. But right now it feels like paying users are being treated as top-of-funnel audience instead of as people invested in the product.\n\nI’d honestly prefer fewer emails with deeper technical updates, roadmap transparency, or contribution opportunities — even if that means less “engagement” on paper.\n\nCurious if others feel the same, and interested to hear how the team is thinking about this tradeoff.",

This kind of honest feedback is exactly what we need to hear.\n\nWe read this aloud to our team in our marketing/DevRel sync today and are thinking a lot about how we can do better here. We want to be developer first, offer great free models/promotions to get more people in and keep folks excited about Kilo Code - but if that comes at the cost of making folks feel like this then that's worthless in the long run.\n\nWe talked about structural changes to the newsletter and are going to be rethinking how we do blogs / email blasts as well. Would you be open to chatting directly? I'd love to hear more of your thoughts and make sure we're actually addressing what matters to you and others who feel the same way.\n\nThanks again for being blunt — it genuinely helps us improve.",
