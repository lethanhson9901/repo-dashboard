Try using the Orchestrator mode to break the task into subtasks with small scope to keep the AI model context small. Most open weight models have small context windows that must be managed carefully, especially when running locally.\n\nChoosing a context size is a model load time parameter (Check Ollama docs). In most cases it's better to use lower quantization models to free up VRAM for the correct context size for the task. Local models do work, especially if they are trained for tool use. Try using the GLM 4.7 Flash model if you have the hardware to run it.",
