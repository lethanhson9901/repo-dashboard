      "text": "I tested several model combinations in Kilo Code. Before the release of GLM 4.7, I mainly used Gemini 3 Flash for all modes, with solid results. I was highly enthusiastic about the release of GLM, but after many cycles of fixing bug after bug, it became clear that GLM 4.7 was not on par with Gemini in terms of architecture. Gemini was able to produce a functional prototype with just a few iterations.\n\nHowever, since GLM 4.7 is significantly more economical, especially with its API subscription plan, I tested a configuration that proves very effective: Gemini 3 Flash for all modes except code, where GLM 4.7 performs perfectly. For small feature architecture, Gemini 3 Flash is sufficient. For full project architecture or large features, I switch to Opus 4.5, but costs escalate rapidly.",

It seems to be the consensus that while GLM 4.7 is a very intelligent model, it goes off the rails in longer multi turn context sessions and breaks stuff / hallucinates. Have you tried Minimax M2. 1 yet? I used M2 for a while and was impressed with how well it could stay on task even over long context. It's great at instruction following and tool calling. I wonder if used M2.1 over GLM 4.7 you'd get better results.",

You pay for the reviews you run, which means you don’t leave money on the table, and you don’t hit invisible rate limits or downgrades when you surpass an arbitrary usage limit.\n\n**Workflow**  \n  \nCodeRabbit is a standalone code review product. It does one thing, and you add it to your existing pile of dev tools.\n\nKilo’s Code Reviews is part of the Kilo platform, the same environment where you’re already writing code, debugging, and deploying. Your reviews happen alongside: \n\n* Agentic Engineering with specialized modes for implementation, architecture, debugging, and orchestration in the IDE or CLI\n* Cloud Agents for accessing Kilo without using your local machine\n* App Builder for prototyping with a live preview\n* Kilo Sessions that sync across VS Code, JetBrains, CLI, and web\n* Kilo Deploy for one-click shipping when the review passes\n* Managed Indexing for context-aware reviews that understand your codebase \n\nIf anyone’s interested, here’s a **more detailed breakdown and comparison**:  \n[https://blog.kilo.ai/p/code-review-alternative-2026]() \n\nQuestion: Anyone who’s tried multiple AI code review tools, what turned out to matter, and what was mostly noise?",

          "text": "The answer is in the screenshot to be honest. You need to use a smarter model. No matter what the marketing claims a 2.6B parameter model is not going to be good enough for most coding tasks or comparable to GPT-4, and it looks like it's failing to execute tool calls correctly. The context window for that model is fairly limited and you are likely using a quantized (dumber) version as well. You *might* get some use out of it by switching from XML to JSON/native tool calling or vice versa, but chances are it's not going to work well. You really need at least a 24B parameter model like Devstral 2 or larger like Qwen 3 Coder 30B A3B for agentic coding, ideally bigger and smarter. If you don't have powerful enough hardware you can get good models for cheap or even free through a variety of providers including synthetic, openrouter, or minimax. Minimax M2 model is currently free on open router and would work better, or even Grok Code Fast 1 which is also free I believe.",

Wow that speaks well of your team, OMG!\n\nI found that the problem was due to a conflict with another VSCode Extension.  \"Todo Tree.\"  It doesn't seem obvious to me how there is shared functionality between that and Kilo Workflows, but that was the problem.  I've disabled the Todo Tree extension and will be discontinuing it's use.\n\nIt makes me wonder if it might be a good idea to add a FAQ for Kilo that mentions any known conflicts with other VSCode extensions.
