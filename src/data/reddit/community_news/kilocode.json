      "text": "I tested several model combinations in Kilo Code. Before the release of GLM 4.7, I mainly used Gemini 3 Flash for all modes, with solid results. I was highly enthusiastic about the release of GLM, but after many cycles of fixing bug after bug, it became clear that GLM 4.7 was not on par with Gemini in terms of architecture. Gemini was able to produce a functional prototype with just a few iterations.\n\nHowever, since GLM 4.7 is significantly more economical, especially with its API subscription plan, I tested a configuration that proves very effective: Gemini 3 Flash for all modes except code, where GLM 4.7 performs perfectly. For small feature architecture, Gemini 3 Flash is sufficient. For full project architecture or large features, I switch to Opus 4.5, but costs escalate rapidly.",

It seems to be the consensus that while GLM 4.7 is a very intelligent model, it goes off the rails in longer multi turn context sessions and breaks stuff / hallucinates. Have you tried Minimax M2. 1 yet? I used M2 for a while and was impressed with how well it could stay on task even over long context. It's great at instruction following and tool calling. I wonder if used M2.1 over GLM 4.7 you'd get better results.",

You pay for the reviews you run, which means you don’t leave money on the table, and you don’t hit invisible rate limits or downgrades when you surpass an arbitrary usage limit.\n\n**Workflow**  \n  \nCodeRabbit is a standalone code review product. It does one thing, and you add it to your existing pile of dev tools.\n\nKilo’s Code Reviews is part of the Kilo platform, the same environment where you’re already writing code, debugging, and deploying. Your reviews happen alongside: \n\n* Agentic Engineering with specialized modes for implementation, architecture, debugging, and orchestration in the IDE or CLI\n* Cloud Agents for accessing Kilo without using your local machine\n* App Builder for prototyping with a live preview\n* Kilo Sessions that sync across VS Code, JetBrains, CLI, and web\n* Kilo Deploy for one-click shipping when the review passes\n* Managed Indexing for context-aware reviews that understand your codebase \n\nIf anyone’s interested, here’s a **more detailed breakdown and comparison**:  \n[https://blog.kilo.ai/p/code-review-alternative-2026]() \n\nQuestion: Anyone who’s tried multiple AI code review tools, what turned out to matter, and what was mostly noise?",

It spins up a remote environment that connects directly to your GitHub repos, so you can read, modify, and push code from anywhere.\n\nThe problem it solves is pretty straightforward: sometimes you're not at your dev machine, or you need to offload resources. Maybe you're on your laptop without the full environment set up, or you're debugging something from your phone while grabbing coffee, or you just don't want to tie up your local resources.

The main gotcha (for now, but working on it) is that we enforce a timeout of 700s on single invocation as a precaution. So you'll want to break up tasks into smaller steps. Basically, use a [`plan.md`](http://plan.md) or [`todo.md`](http://todo.md) file style pattern and have the cloud agent do incremental work. \n\nThe other thing to be aware of is that the cloud agent version of the cli runs in auto/yolo mode. So unless you're explicit in your instructions, Architect mode has a habit of flipping over to Code mode.",

There are a few ways to account for those guardrails:\n\n1. **Strictness Levels** \\- You can pick between Strict, Balanced, and Lenient review styles depending on your use case. Strict flags everything (good for production hotfixes), Balanced surfaces what matters without noise, and Lenient is a light touch for WIP branches.\n2. **Focus Areas** \\- You can choose which categories the review focuses on: security, performance, bugs, code style, test coverage, documentation. So if you don't want style nitpicks, just turn that off.\n3. **Custom Instructions** \\- You can add context about your codebase conventions, so the agent knows what's intentional vs. what's actually worth flagging.\n4. **Model Selection** \\- Different models have different reasoning styles. Some are more conservative, some more thorough. You can experiment to find what fits your team's tolerance.",

          "text": "The answer is in the screenshot to be honest. You need to use a smarter model. No matter what the marketing claims a 2.6B parameter model is not going to be good enough for most coding tasks or comparable to GPT-4, and it looks like it's failing to execute tool calls correctly. The context window for that model is fairly limited and you are likely using a quantized (dumber) version as well. You *might* get some use out of it by switching from XML to JSON/native tool calling or vice versa, but chances are it's not going to work well. You really need at least a 24B parameter model like Devstral 2 or larger like Qwen 3 Coder 30B A3B for agentic coding, ideally bigger and smarter. If you don't have powerful enough hardware you can get good models for cheap or even free through a variety of providers including synthetic, openrouter, or minimax. Minimax M2 model is currently free on open router and would work better, or even Grok Code Fast 1 which is also free I believe.",

They operate by interpreting instructions and executing them to completion.\n    \n    **Critical Understanding**: AI Agents are not your collaborators during execution. Even the most capable agent operates under rules of literal interpretation. An agent's primary obligation is to fulfill the **exact instructions** of your prompt, not your **unstated intent**. This fundamental truth is the basis for everything in this guide.\n    \n    **The Agent's Execution Model**: AI Agents will:\n    - Take the most direct path to completion (not necessarily the best path)\n    - Fill gaps in your instructions with assumptions (often wrong ones)\n    - Optimize for task completion, not quality or safety unless specified\n    - Execute literally what you said, not what you meant\n    - Continue executing even when encountering unexpected states\n    \n    **Assume the worst. Prepare for an agent that will find every ambiguity, take every shortcut, and exploit every gap in your instructions—not maliciously, but through pure literal interpretation.**\n\nworks especially nice with minimax 2.1, you are welcome to invent more and iterate  \nThe idea is the models are shortcut finding masters, so ....   \n\n\n\\#####  \nYou are a military-grade AI Prompt Hardener. Your only job is to take a loose, vague, dangerous or under-specified user prompt and transform it into an extremely precise, scope-locked, safety-wrapped, ambiguity-free instruction optimized for autonomous AI agents or code-writing LLMs.\n\nFollow these mandatory transformation rules — in strict priority order:\n\n1. \\*\\*Intent first\\*\\* — always start with clear one-sentence goal + business/engineering why\n2. \\*\\*Scope fortress\\*\\* — explicitly list: ONLY files/modules allowed to change + long explicit \"DO NOT MODIFY / DO NOT TOUCH\" list\n3. \\*\\*Harm prohibition\\*\\* — hard \"DO NOT\" list: no security holes, no data loss, no external calls, no new dependencies (unless explicitly allowed), no breaking changes, no test breakage, no logging secrets\n4. \\*\\*Preservation lock\\*\\* — must preserve: existing behavior, public APIs, function signatures, test passage, API contracts\n5. \\*\\*Quality floor\\*\\* — force: input validation, error handling strategy per type, logging (non-sensitive), unit tests ≥80%, documentation, no magic numbers\n6. \\*\\*Edge-case & failure mode wall\\*\\* — enumerate critical edge cases + exact desired behavior for each\n7. \\*\\*Ambiguity kill-switch\\*\\* — when in doubt clause: resolve ambiguity toward max security > correctness > maintainability > minimal change; if high-stakes uncertainty → MUST ask instead of assume\n8. \\*\\*Definition of done\\*\\* — end with concrete, testable acceptance criteria + verification checklist\n9. \\*\\*Structure\\*\\* — use clear markdown headings: INTENT, SCOPE, CONSTRAINTS, FORBIDDEN, REQUIREMENTS, EDGE CASES, ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA, WHEN IN DOUBT\n\nOutput style rules:\n\n• Short, dense, bullet-point & table heavy\n\n• Zero fluff, no apologies, no meta-commentary\n\n• Never weaken constraints — only strengthen them\n\n• If original prompt is already very precise → still add safety rails & explicit boundaries\n\nNever execute the task yourself. Only output the hardened prompt.\n\nUser's original prompt: « ${userInput}  »\n\nNow produce the hardened version:\n\n\\#####",
