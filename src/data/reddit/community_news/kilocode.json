For example you can create Front-end, Back-end, QA/Tester, OWASP role-based (sub-)agents and tell orchestrator agent implement feature XYZ and use ABC subagent to did X, Y, Z operations.\n- Skills: AKA MCP extensions. You describe extra details, schema, syntax, abilities what agent can do using MCP. Or you can define entire tool without MCP. For example you can refer [Obsidian Skills](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills?tab=readme-ov-file). Some of features not available in Obsidian MCP, and some duded decided to create skills for them. [Bases](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-skills/blob/main/skills/obsidian-bases/SKILL.md) option may serve good example of tool definition.\n- Workflows: AKA guardrailed predefined todo checklists. You describe order of actions and \"check points\". Common example is git workflows where defined flow, strategies, when what ask, what not to do and whad todo. Just google few examples of them for OpenCode and you will get a picture.",

Presumably, agent should check, if it needs any skills .\n\nAllegedly, kilo has its own implementation of skills.  \n**Install and skills collection for the Kilo**  \nKilo Code implemented \"Agent Skills\".  \n[https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills](https://kilo.ai/docs/customize/skills)\n\nYou can discover and install community-created skills through:\n\n* **Kilo Marketplace** \\- Browse skills directly in the Kilo Code extension via the Marketplace tab, or explore the [Kilo Marketplace repository](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/kilo-marketplace) on GitHub\n* [Agent Skills Specification](https://agentskills.io/home) \\- The open specification that skills follow, enabling interoperability across different AI agents",
