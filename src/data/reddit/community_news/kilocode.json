The [PR](https://github.com/Kilo-Org/cloud/pull/201), in case you want to validate. \n\n**I have just confirmed that the credits have been successfully added to your account.** Please refresh your dashboard, and you should see them reflected there now!\n\nIf anyone else is still experiencing issues with their Kilo Pass credits, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly at [**hi@kilocode.ai**](mailto:hi@kilocode.ai) so we can look into your specific account manually.\n\nThank you for your patience and for being a day-one subscriber! 🚀",

My goal was simple: use **OpenCode** to blast out the initial project structure (since it’s way faster for scaffolding) and then hand that context over to **Kilo Code** to handle the complex logic and heavy lifting.\n\nIn theory, this should be the perfect \"best of both worlds\" setup. In practice, the handoff is a nightmare.\n\nEvery time I try to bridge them, I hit friction. The context doesn't transfer cleanly, or I have to manually massage the output from OpenCode before Kilo can even understand what's going on. I eventually just give up and go back to doing it manually or sticking to one slow tool, which defeats the whole point.\n\nI’m starting to feel like I’m the only one dumb enough to try this hybrid workflow.\n\n* Has anyone actually managed to get a stable pipeline running between these two?\n* Are you using a specific middleman script to format the handoff, or just raw-dogging the copy-paste like I am?\n* Or did you just try it, realize the interoperability was broken, and move on?\n\nJust trying to figure out if there is a \"clean\" way to get them to talk to each other, or if I'm just wasting my time trying to optimize this.",

Basically it uses your existing work modes as signals to route each request to the right model:\n\n* Planning and reasoning tasks (Architect, Orchestrator, Ask, Plan modes) → Claude Opus 4.6 for complex system design and multi-step thinking\n* Implementation work (Code, Build, Debug, Explore modes) → Claude Sonnet 4.5 for fast, cost-effective code writing and editing\n\nYou just switch modes like you normally would and Auto Model handles the model selection in the background. \n\nCurious if anyone's tried it yet - what are your first impressions? Is it actually helpful?",

It is coming along terribly, which means perfectly.\n\nI used Kilo App builder to build it  \n  \nI did it for free using the free Minimax model  \n  \nI hope I did Clark Griswold proud!\n\nCheck it out here: [https://fresh-reed-4538.d.kiloapps.io/](https://fresh-reed-4538.d.kiloapps.io/)\n\nAs for why I did this,  Kilo is running the Worst Website Ever Hackathon through Wednesday. So 2 days left to show off something truly arresting to the well trained eye! \n\nPrizes: Mac Mini for the winner, $500 cash, people's choice award. All built with the App Builder (free).\n\nMore details here: [kilo.codes/worstwebsite](http://kilo.codes/worstwebsite)  or come chat with me about it in the Discord! \n\n(quick note- I am on the community team so while I can participate, I can't win. I'm just doing it for love of the game! )",

          "text": "Too bad the app builder is complete and total garbage. Kilo seems to be going off in too many directions, they want to be the 'everything AI' company but it's failing; hard.\n\nThings like the VS Code plugin, awesome.\n\nTheir app builder, garbage. Even something simple as reverting changes doesn't exist, and if you can't basically one shot it, it either never loads the preview site or any slight change causes the entire website to change.\n\nOther things, iOS app, etc. Y'all ever going launch it?\n\nCloud Agents, guys. Do one thing well, seriously. Not mediocre everything. If y'all weren't offering free new models, I'd have dumped Kilo a long time ago. The value proposition isn't form having good stuff, it's you got free stuff. That's a hard way to build a business.",

However, Kimi K2 using web-search found that they have two APIs, and the one for inference is OpenAI-compatible, and the other API, which is for DigitalOcean cloud management, can be used through MCP.",
