      "text": "This Friday, xAI is ending the free period for Grok Code Fast 1. This marks the longest time that a free, production-ready AI model has been available at no cost in the history of AI coding.\n\nGrok has been the most popular model in Kilo for several months now, with over 700B tokens used every month since the free launch back in August.\n\nWe surveyed 1,282 people about how Grok Code Fast helped them. Of those respondents, **71% said they will continue using the model once it becomes paid.**\n\nKilo Code has been the largest “user” of Grok Code Fast 1 on OpenRouter.\n\nUsage has been high and consistent, with the model actively used for planning, coding, and debugging.\n\nUsers have built incredible things with Grok Code Fast 1 and other xAI models in Kilo, and we want that to continue.\n\n# Special Deal\n\nFor this reason, there's a special deal - you can get up to $199 in free credits. We’re DOUBLING the 50% first-month bonus, so if you upgrade by Monday you get an extra month of the 50% credits bonus(typically reserved only for the first month).\n\nThis special offer is valid until 11:59pm EST on Monday, January 26th. You can go for the full double-first-month bonus, or you always have the option to just get the $20 first top-up bonus – top up $10 of credits and we’ll add $20 on top of it, instantly.\n\nHere are more details about the offer: [https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you](https://blog.kilo.ai/i/185132310/dont-panic-weve-got-a-special-deal-for-you)",

By using a fresh context window for each subtask (i.e. a dumb ai aka Ralph), the context does not pollute the result. Ralph loops have been gotten some fame in the last few months. ",

BMAD roles are similar to native Kilo Code roles but include more sophisticated Agile development scaffolding, and there's no reason native Kilo Code roles could not be used instead.   \n  \nMy loop works through standard BMAD tasks (create-story, develop-story, test-review, etc.) with different roles in fresh context each time, creating documentation artifacts so the next role/task can pick them up in a fresh context. The loop goes back to fix bugs before progressing forward and runs for hours until complete. Using the loop, the Orchestrator can be instructed to implement all epics, one epic, or a specific story. I find it amusing that Claude Code folks are excited about something that has been in Kilo Code for ages.",

Acknowledge that you’re not the only option with pay-per-token, moreso given you forked and merge changes from a variety of nearly-identical solutions. Do not call your free inference providers as “rug pulls” when they start charging. You and them (as was their intent) have gained users and data from the free runs they provided - as the data shows, KC users were the largest users of Grok Code, and I’m sure tons of new users showed up to make that happen.

Try using the Orchestrator mode to break the task into subtasks with small scope to keep the AI model context small. Most open weight models have small context windows that must be managed carefully, especially when running locally.\n\nChoosing a context size is a model load time parameter (Check Ollama docs). In most cases it's better to use lower quantization models to free up VRAM for the correct context size for the task. Local models do work, especially if they are trained for tool use. Try using the GLM 4.7 Flash model if you have the hardware to run it.",

Then you can host your MCP Proxy on another machine and if exposed to the internet, even add it to say ChatGPT's web UI.\n\nIt reduces the context size overall but adds more latency since to call a tool it requires 2 calls now (first to search, then to call it).\n\nMy main motivator was RAM usage. Running a bunch of node programs or python interpreter instances for every single MCP server took a lot of memory. So I used remote MCP servers and maintained a .json but some MCP servers do not have remote variants and it still took up a lot of context and a bit more RAM than just one MCP server.\n\nOf course, this does not really work that well for project scoped MCP servers or any servers that require local file system/network port access e.g. DevTools or DB MCP servers.",

Being able to read more text by resizing horizontally is an essential feature. Mandatory limiting of UI width is frustrating to those of us with ultrawide monitors.   \n  \nKilo Code product developers, revert this PR!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eeskl6spqeg1.png?width=2287&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3b2edb6f586a86b62dd872ec6ffe33e4bb9f9bc\n\n",
