      "text": "So I mostly use Claude Code Opus for my projects.. coding. It's very good. That said.. I tend to think having Gemini 3 thinking and GPT 5.2 High \"reviewing\" is a good thing because it gives my code a different review perspective. I then typically take the long response GPT or Gemini give, feed it back in to Claude with the \"I had an independent team review what we've done and this is what they had to say about it. Take their responses and re-analyze the project with what they said and give me an updated review..\". Something like that.\n\nI am not an expert coder (not these days.. getting old).. but most of what I read from responses, apply the fixes (I do go through most of the suggestions and often have multiple rounds of \"What does this do\" and \"eli5 this bit of code\", etc.. before I have a final work plan.\n\nAnyone else do this? If so.. what are your results? Are you seeing it get more accurate/better overall coding results? Architecture, etc?\n\nIs there any \"magic\" I might be missing to utilize this approach to try to get the absolute best coding out of Opus? ",

This screenshot shows the **average cost per Claude request** before and after our recent update.\n\nIn earlier Kilo Code versions, Claude requests were more expensive because the tool's results weren’t cached efficiently. In the newer version, we improved API call caching, which significantly reduced the average cost per request.  \nI would recommend upgrading and giving it a try ;)",

What's causing it? Can you push a PR to fix it?\n\n**Implement fixes from Slack discussions:**\n\nExample: Can you implement the caching improvements we discussed in this thread?\n\n**Push PRs without leaving Slack:**\n\nExample: Can you change \"2025\" to \"2026\" through all of the files in our kilo-org/kilocode repo?\n\nThe bot reads the full Slack thread, accesses your connected GitHub repos, and either answers your question or creates a branch and PR directly.\n\n**How to get started for free:**\n\n1. Connect your GitHub repos at [app.kilo.ai](http://app.kilo.ai) → [Integrations](https://app.kilocode.ai/integrations)\n2. Add the Slack integration from the [same page](https://app.kilocode.ai/integrations)\n3. Choose from a paid model (the bot will use your existing Kilo balance) or a free model (you can use **MiniMax 2.1** for free for the first week)\n4. Mention Kilo in any channel or DM",

If you don’t use them all, the remaining balance **rolls over** to the next month. These credits never expire! You also receive credits boost each month. \n\nThe main difference between the Pass and just buying credits upfront is the **Credit Boost**. When you have a Pass, you accumulate months that increase the \"boost\" (extra bonus credits) you receive.\n\n* **How the Boost works:** The *boost* credits are granted on top of your Pass credits. Please note that while your main credits roll over, **boost credits expire at the end of the month.**\n* **The Ramp:** The longer you stay, the higher the boost becomes. In **Month 1**, you start with a **50% boost**, and that percentage continues to climb every month you stay on the Pass.\n\n**Monthly vs. Yearly Plans**\n\n* **Monthly Pass:** You pay month-to-month, and your boost percentage grows over time as you \"ramp up.\"\n* **Yearly Pass:** You pay for the entire year upfront. Instead of waiting for the ramp, you receive your monthly credits plus a **fixed, high-tier boost** every single month.\n\nYou can see the full **Credit Boost Ramp** map by clicking the \"i\" (information) button I’ve highlighted in the screenshot below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo9tm7hwypdg1.png?width=1101&format=png&auto=webp&s=80f6fd1823c8e443b73b7b6603224cff65b6d771\n\nLet me know if you still have any questions about Kilo Pass.",

I think the attraction is if you’re spending more that $49 a month consistently then this auto fills you up each month and adds money once you do run through that $49.  It is very confusing how much, when and how long you have to use that added money, but it seems like they are giving a little money to you for consistently using the product.  I don’t see how or why this works accept to entice people to spend each month.  I use the free models so usually don’t hit 19/month so it doesn’t make any sense for someone like me. I’m not sure how it works financially on their end, especially since they say your 19 dollars worth of credits stay and don’t go way at the end of the month, whether or not you spend them or get bonus money",

A digital pet that actually needs care. Full Tamagotchi nostalgia but built entirely through conversation. The thing has personality.\n\n🥈 Second Place: Polyrhythm Metronome by Jędrzej Smal. For musicians who think in multiple time signatures. Layer 7/8 over 5/4, customize sounds, make patterns that would confuse most drummers.\n\n🥉 Third Place: Triple Town-ish by Keith Hall. A merge puzzle game on a 6×6 grid. The kind you open \"for a minute\" and suddenly it's 3am.\n\nThere's still an Honorable Mention prize ($150 in credits) up for grabs. Community voting is open until Friday, January 16th at 11:59pm EST:\n\n👉 [https://vote.kilo.codes/](https://vote.kilo.codes/)\n\nThe team also wrote up what the main takeaways were from the challenge. Worth a read if you're curious about where App Builder is headed -> [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/app-builder-challenge](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/app-builder-challenge)",
