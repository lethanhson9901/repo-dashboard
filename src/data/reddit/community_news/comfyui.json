Usually that requires me passing sage attention arg during launch, but your node pack has made it the default overall in my environment?\n\nEdit: Sigh, does anyone know how to fix this. Disabling the node packs or Uninstaller it does not revert the changes. Passing global flash attention does not help. Forcefully removing Env manager, as is does not show up in installed node packs, does not fix. Sigh, am I gonna have to remake my environment and reset my custom node installations?\n\nEdit2: Remove all the custom nodes that were installed by the update along with the sam3 node pack. Go to the venv and uninstall comfy-env. Use find command to remove any traces of comfy-env. Then remove your main.py and pull a fresh one from github. Thats how to fix it.",

Thanks, that's a great question:\n\nSo there are a couple ways to do it, I haven't tested it yet but Andrea Pozzetti did release a great node for ComfyUI doing just that:\n[ComfyUI-MotionCapture](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-MotionCapture)\n\nOther online solutions exist such as: [Rokoko](https://www.rokoko.com/products/video) and [Deepmotion](https://www.deepmotion.com/)\n\nFinally for another direction also directly inside ComfyUI, you can go the route of prompt-to-3D animation with [HY-MOTION](https://github.com/jtydhr88/ComfyUI-HY-Motion1) which also have an option to save FBX animations compatible with Mixamo.\n\nI hope these will help you :)\n\n\nAs a bonus, (if you want to go experimental!) I designed a suite of nodes for MoCap directly inside ComfyUI, which exports 3D data using mediapipe as a json file, you'd need to go through some process to get some conversion going and redirect that 3D data to a 3D rig.\nOr you can experiment with my MoCap nodes to directly use the output (openpose skeleton), here's the link in case : \n[ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap)",

Gonna see how it performs vs the A100, cost is  basically the same at 8.x units per hour, curious to see if there's much difference in gen times. Quick tests on mage gen in A1111 is always pretty quick but seems faster with this, so i'm definitely hopeful about wan on comfy. \n\nI've been seeing the H100 available for a couple months now, but every time i try to use it, it's not available so kicks me down to another GPU when I try. I keep trying at odd hours, over the weekend etc but same results. I'm guessing it's not just an option since you get bumped to the back of the line unless you're on Colab Pro+ (priority access to more powerful premuim GPU's hell yeah), so I'll upgrade and try. I've been on Pro at $9/mo using pay as you go to buy extra units as I need them, but at this point I'm always buying at least 500 more per month so the upgrade to the $50/mo plan with 600 units included makes sense. I've been using A100 since they became available last year, only thing that made playing with video gen even tolerable for me. Stoked to see what H100 can do, even at double+ the cost.\n\nAnd for those asking the question about rent vs buy; yes i've been saying for a long time that it's better to rent at $.80/hr than spend 5-6K on a gpu that's outdated in a couple years unless you have a solid business case for doing so; as in you're genning professionally for actual money, running 10+ hours a day, can write off your system as a business expense, etc. As a hobby user I usually go through $75-100 worth of units monthly genning a fair amount of \"content\" in my spare time on an A100 at \\~$.80/hr. Where's the breakeven  on that vs buying your own, plus a system that can run it? Yeah sure there's a point where the math makes sense but until genning content is actually what makes you money and genning *more* content makes you *more* money, i just can't see it.",

If models have to DL every time that'll change a lot, obviously. Probly depends on the kind of service you're using and if persistent storage is available, cost etc. \n\n  \nMy early comfy configs used to take a long time to load, but after I had to wipe my install at one point and clear out the cruft - all the nodes I was initially experimenting with, all the packages they required, etc, it made a HUGE difference. Blank out the pip install line and only add back in the stuff I need now, and spinup and load that used to take \\~45 minutes from run button to first gen now takes less than 20. Now if I had to do this multiple times per day or something maybe I'd wonder how efficient it is. But doing it once to gen for a couple hours in my spare time, it's not enough to make me sweat at 80 cents an hour. \n\nRising costs would change the math, yeah. The rule still applies though I think. And I haven't seen costs go up on Colab, jsut my desire for more speed. That's all that ends up costing me more. G4 from A100 is a no brainer for me. H100, I really gotta think about. Gonna be awesome to have the option for sure, but at over double the cost. My primary question as always: How many margaritas per month will this cost me?",

I just stumbled on this last night and will work in many ways to solve basic cases.  You can even do face replacement.\n\nInstead of creating using and creating a mask and a typical inpainting workflow, instead open the mask tool and use the PAINTBRUSH, select a color like RED, and if you have multiple things use different colors.  Then just tell Qwen to \"Replace red area with face from image 2\" or \"Place coffee cup on table in red area\".\n\nSure, if you have more complex needs for masking, blur, etc... then inpainting is the way to go, but this little hack actually solves a lot of basic inpainting type work.

I had seen someone post previously about adding Magenta padding to an image to expand the size of the image by saying \"Remove the magenta areas and reveal what's underneath\", simple yet effective.\n\nGreat tip for us beginners, thank you for posting.",

      "text": "I'm trying to create a green screen effect from a 1080p 60fps video using the **ComfyUI-SAM3** nodes (PozzettiAndrea's version). Since I'm working with a strict **8GB VRAM** limit, I'm downscaling the frames to 856x480 (or 864x480) and processing them in small batches (`frame_load_cap` = 16) to avoid OOM errors.\n\nHere is my current workflow (screenshots attached):\n\n1. **VHS Load Video**: Downscaling the video and limiting the frame count. (I selected 'AnimateDiff' format here just to force the custom width/height options to appear).\n2. **Image Resize**: Making sure the frames are exactly 856x480 before feeding them to SAM3.\n3. **SAM3 Pipeline**: `SAM3 Video Segmentation` (text prompt: \"person\") -> `SAM3 Propagate` \\-> `SAM3 Video Output`.\n4. **Compositing**: I used an `Image Composite Masked` node.\n   * Destination: A solid green image (856x480).\n   * Image (Source): The resized original video frames.\n   * Mask: The `masks` output from SAM3 Video Output.\n\n**The Problem:** My final output from the `Video Combine` node is just a completely 100% solid green screen. The masked person is not showing up at all.\n\nIt seems like either SAM3 is outputting a completely blank/black mask, or my composite node is set up wrong. I've checked the connections multiple times.\n\nDoes anyone see what I'm doing wrong in the attached screenshots? Any advice for a low-VRAM SAM3 setup would be hugely appreciated! Thanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5zki8wgdvlg1.jpg?width=1610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd742c02fb488affc6fe434ea3b91ba0004a288\n\n",
