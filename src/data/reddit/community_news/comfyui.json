I want to keep it simple so that even kids can have fun with it.\n\nJust a heads up, when you start drawing, if you  open a new tab to open other workflow ,  the drawing will disappear. Enjoy creating your masterpieces!\n\ns+ drag to size brush\n\no+ drag to opacity\n\nspace to hide ui.\n\ndraw\n\nofc is not krita (its a file with 476 KB in size) , is just a easy and fun tool",

I've seen some solutions to this in the past but there have always been some sort of limiting factor with them. Sadly--and predictably--Adobe is pushing their own crap AI features that don't allow the customization (i.e. LoRAs) that all digital artists need for integrating gen AI into their production processes.\n\nI'm constantly going back and forth between Photoshop and ComfyUI. There are several advanced features that I use in Photoshop such as smart adjustment layers. But mostly it is general basic editing.\n\nIf this node can take root in the community, I think it should be continually expanded with features. Like I said, it doesn't need to have everything that Photoshop does. The tools should focus on how work is done in ComfyUI.\n\nI'll try out these custom nodes as soon as I can.",

There are some really good ideas here with layers, color wheel, brushes, etc. I also like that it immediately goes into a \"full\" mode as soon as you click on it so you can start drawing. I also like that you can move the floating windows, although users should be warned that the layers palette might be hidden; mine was behind the color wheel when I started it up.\n\nThat said, as an artist myself, the pressure sensitivity is poor. I don't expect it to be great - this was vibecoded as you already stated in the comments section below and is **not** a critique of your efforts - it's just a reality check for other digital artists so they can temper their expectations.\n\nFor me, this is not usable as a sketch tool. That said, the idea is sound, so I'd like to try using sketches w/QIE 2511 and Flux Klein to potential drive the results, particularly w/Z-Image Edit. I tested out Krita AI in the past and never really got too deep into it because at the time I couldn't figure out how to make it work w/my custom workflows. It seemed to work well if you're just using a very basic workflow setup, but my workflows can have noodles all over the place. My other observations are probably not warranted as I didn't give it enough time.\n\nAnywho, thanks for this tool. Looking forward to seeing it evolve, or at the very least get some good dialogue started by Comfy about implementing something permanently into the software. Any photoshop-type integration would be a plus for so many reasons.",

There are some really good ideas here with layers, color wheel, brushes, etc. I also like that it immediately goes into a \"full\" mode as soon as you click on it so you can start drawing. I also like that you can move the floating windows, although users should be warned that the layers palette might be hidden; mine was behind the color wheel when I started it up.\n\nThat said, as an artist myself, the pressure sensitivity is poor. I don't expect it to be great - this was vibecoded as you already stated in the comments section below and is **not** a critique of your efforts - it's just a reality check for other digital artists so they can temper their expectations.\n\nFor me, this is not usable as a sketch tool. That said, the idea is sound, so I'd like to try using sketches w/QIE 2511 and Flux Klein to potential drive the results. I'm also interested in finding out if it can be used for Z-Image Turbo/Base. I tested out Krita AI in the past and never really got too deep into it because at the time I couldn't figure out how to make it work w/my custom workflows. It seemed to work well if you're just using a very basic workflow setup, but my workflows can have noodles all over the place. My other observations are probably not warranted as I didn't give it enough time.\n\nAnywho, thanks for this tool. Looking forward to seeing it evolve, or at the very least get some good dialogue started by Comfy about implementing something permanently into the software. Any photoshop-type integration would be a plus for so many reasons.",

Just keep in mind that sometimes there's compatibility issues where even though an app can export to a format, you might not get the same results in the native app. Just something to consider if/when you decide to do that, but don't let it deter you.\n\n  \nRE: Brushes...you absolutely want to look into better pressure sensitivity if you're going to play w/brushes, because that's going to determine how they perform. Definitely look into it; pressure sensitivity's been around for a long time, so I'm sure it's a very common science by now.\n\nI'd recommend asking Claude to help you implement code that can A) take full advantage of the levels of pressure sensitivity of tablet pens, and B) enable stabilization. If you can get those two working, more than half the work is already done.\n\nI say go for it! There are very basic apps that can take advantage of pressure sensitivity, so I'm sure it's doable.\n\nGood luck!",

The workflow is straightforward: add the ComfySketch node to your graph and draw the pose directly with a tablet pen.\n\nThe prompt I used:\n\n>Make the person in Image 1 take exactly the same pose as the person in Image 2. Changing the style or background of the person in Image 1 is not appropriate, so do not do that. The new pose should be pixel-accurate to the pose we are copying. The positions of the arms, head, and legs should match the pose we want to copy. Change the view and angle to exactly match Image 2. The head tilt and eye direction should also match the person in Image 2.\n\nworkflow: [https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230](https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230)\n\nAuthor link:  \n[Drawing node for ComfyUI (ComfySketch)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1qvo6m7/drawing_node_for_comfyui_comfysketch/)  \nby[u/Vivid-Loss9868](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vivid-Loss9868/) in[comfyui](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/)",

FLUX.2 is super powerful and surprises me every day, but I know I need to work on learning how the model \"sees\" things and works best to accomplish complex workflows. \n\nI just started playing with depth maps to decouple this.  Particularly when I want to decouple the virtual 'geometry' from the virtual texture maps. It can specify shape and layout without it learning colors, patterns, lighting, etc. from the reference image.\n\nI guess ultimately one could end up with a number of input references (for chars): 1) character likeness,  2) pose,  3) outfit, 4) outfit materials (if you need to change color or fabric), 5) environment, 6) art style/technique.  \n\nSo far I've done stylized portraits of important people with FLUX.2 and the best results have been using a photo (or painting or whatever exists) as an input reference and prompting for a style.   I've only done \"banknote engraving\" and \"engraving by Albrecht Durer\".  But it worked great!  Kontext often sucked.  It reduced them to things like \"a guy with glasses and a moustache\".  Any guy with glasses and a moustache.  The web is filled with portraits like this and I'm not going to make more.  \n\nAn anime character can be approximated fairly easily, but a certain craggy older man's face contains a tremendous amount of detail and to someone hypersensitive like me, even an iconic character like Einstein can look so wrong.  He's just another old guy with wild hair and a moustache.  Sorry, but I've been on a huge \"likeness\" kick because it appears to be disappearing from the web.  Outside of places like here, where people put lots of effort into character likeness, the rest of the web - even big magazines - are putting forth the least amount of effort and make cheesy, crappy images. And I don't whine so much because it's an assault on my eyes as it's because it all gets trained into the next generation of models.  \\[/end rant\\] \n\nFLUX.2 likeness can be \\~70% absolutely perfect.  I might have to gen a 2nd or 3rd at most.  Not, \"kinda looks like\", or \"good from someone no one really knows\".  But wows me on people I know really well and can spot AI gens of instantly.  I need to explore this further as I've just started to try other art mediums with varying success.",

In practice, strong “tone/emotion” prompts often lead to **voice drift** or only subtle/inconsistent emotion changes. If you need consistent emotions, the usual workaround is **separate reference samples per emotion/style** (or using a TTS model that explicitly supports expressive conditioning).\n\nWe’re also keeping an eye on Qwen3-TTS models updates, if/when reliable emotion/style control for cloned voices becomes available (and fits our integration), we’ll evaluate it and ship support in Rebit as soon as we can.",

Much better instrumentally than with version 1.0, and a lot better with lyric accuracy.  One word it struggled with was \"destiny\" which came out as Denny in two versions.  A second one it had trouble was with \"Mozzarella\"\n\nI tried to vary the vocalist description, and it didn't change much of the voice.\n\nGeneral: Least accurately Lyrically  \nPower Metal, Powerful male vocalist, soaring high pitched vocals, operatic vocalist, lyrics sung story style, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,  rapid double base drumming\n\nA Sabaton like sound: This one sounded a bit less like synth guitars, most accurate with lyrics, got Mozzarella right, only messed up Destiny.  \nPower Metal, male vocalist, powerful baritone voice, lyrics sung story style, clear diction, steady military style marches set to metal, big bold hooks, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, galloping rythm, tight precussive riffs with a battlefield feel, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,\n\nStatovarios sound: Worst with lyrics, also did a bit reordering, and repeating and least less poppy voice.  \nPower Metal, Powerful male vocalist, soaring vocals, classical-inspired guitar solos, lyrics, anthemic, technical precision, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,  rapid double base drumming\n\nThere is some bug with it, since the first generation went very quickly, but the second one took a lot in TextEncodeAceStepAudio1.5 about 2x as long and gave the following error in VAE Decode\n\n0 models unloaded.  \nWarning: Ran out of memory when regular VAE decoding, retrying with tiled VAE decoding.\n\nSo I just killed it, and reran after waiting 8 minutes.\n\nSecond time I tried clearing cache and release models before running, This time TextEcode worked good but VAE Decpde gave the same error.  It might be because I tried 6 minutes, but first run only used 20GB of my 4090's vram.\n\nRerun I also got a lot of regardless of how it ran:  \nFlash Attention failed, using default SDPA: Mask must not be set for Flash attention\n\nWarning: Ran out of memory when regular VAE decoding, retrying with tiled VAE decoding.

It might sound like the song starts and there is an attempt to start singing but it never really gets going and just focuses on a few words rather than on singing the lyrics you typed.",

      "text": "Hello everyone!  \nI've been using ComfyUI for over two years now and I've been messing around with the new model that are released. It's so much fun! This experience has only been so satisfying thanks to everyone sharing their knowledge and Workflows here on Reddit and in Discord groups.\n\nWith that in mind, and wanting to create a backup environment for my workflows, I created a repository on GitHub and included all my work so far (I plan to keep updating it).\n\nI wanted to thank this wonderful community and everyone for their contributions. I hope that, at least, these workflows will help someone along the way.\n\nI had a very promising journey a few years ago at Civitai, creating LoRAs of Flux (before the big explosion of censorship and some other topics). I'm thinking about creating a similar repository on Git, sharing techniques for datasets, prompt captures, and training configurations; I'm still figuring out how to do it.\n\nAnyways, see you down the line on this almost endless road of learning and tinkering.  \nCheers!\n\n[https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows](https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows)",

      "text": "With a recent upgrade to a 5090, I can start training loras with hi-res images containing lots of tiny details. Reading through [this lora training guide](https://civitai.com/articles/7777?highlight=1763669) I wondered if training on high resolution images would work for SDXL or would just be a waste of time. That led me down a rabbit hole that would cost me 4 hours, but it was worth it because I found [this blog post](https://medium.com/@efrat_taig/vae-the-latent-bottleneck-why-image-generation-processes-lose-fine-details-a056dcd6015e) which very clearly explains why SDXL always seems to drop the ball when it comes to \"high frequency details\" and why training it with high-quality images would be a waste of time if I wanted to preserve those details in its output.\n\nThe keyword I was missing was the number of **channels** the VAE model uses. The higher the number of channels, the more detail that can be reconstructed during decoding. SDXL (and SD1.5, Qwen) uses a 4-channel VAE, but the number can go higher. When Flux was released, I saw higher quality out of the model, but far slower generation times. That is because it uses a 16-channel VAE. It turns out Flux is not slower than SDXL, it's simply doing more work, and I couldn't properly appreciate that advantage at the time.\n\nFlux, SD3 (which everyone clowned on), and now the popular Z-Image all use 16-channel VAEs which have lower compression than SDXL, which allows them to reconstruct higher fidelity images. So you might be wondering: why not just use a 16-channel VAE on SDXL? The answer is it's not compatible, the model itself will not accept latent images at the compression ratios that 16-channel VAEs encode/decode. You would probably need to re-train the model from the ground up to give it that ability.\n\nHigher channel count comes at a cost though, which materializes in generation time and VRAM. For some, the tradeoff is worth it, but I wanted crystal clarity before I dumped a bunch of time and energy into lora training. I will probably pick 1440x1440 resolution for SDXL loras, and 1728x1728 or higher for Z-Image.\n\nThe resolution itself isn't what the model learns though, that would be the relationships between the pixels, which can be reproduced at ANY resolution. The key is that some pixel relationships (like in text, eyelids, fingernails) are often not represented in the training data with enough pixels either for the model to learn, or for the VAE to reproduce. Even if the model learned the concept of a fishing net and generated a perfect fishing net, the VAE would still destroy that fishing net before spitting it out.\n\nWith all of that in mind, the reason why early models sucked at hands, and full-body shots had jumbled faces is obvious. The model was doing its best to draw those details in latent space, but the VAE simply discarded those details upon decoding the image. And who gets blamed? Who but the star of the show, the model itself, which in retrospect, did nothing wrong. This is why closeup images express more detail than zoomed-out ones.\n\nSo why does the image need to be compressed at all? Because it would be way too computationally expensive to generate full-resolution images, so the job of the VAE is to compress the image into a more manageable size for the model to work with. This compression is always a factor of 8, so from a lora training standpoint, if you want the model to learn any particular detail, that detail should still be clear when the training image is reduced by 8x or else it will just get lost in the noise.\n\n[The more channels, the less information is destroyed](https://preview.redd.it/ltrsxhyytigg1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d871b7f22f3066adf852063e1381c6663ff0c20)",

So there were times when base was nudging along in right direction but then turbo goes completely different way making minor but breaking changes. Based on that I would assume to use LoRa on turbo.\n\nBut it actually depends on your hand off point, kinda like wan. It also depends on how base and turbo react to same LoRa. I did a quick test. Prompt:\n\n    Lain fron anime Serial experiments of Lain sitting on the floor in the center of completely dark room . Different wires and corrugated pipes containing high speed cables snake across the floor connecting stacks of crt monitors around her. The pixelated screens glow a soft grey blue and illuminate the scene. Retro anime style.\n\nFunnily it didnt know her so this makes a good exhibition of my point. Now if I let base do the heavy lifting like in first pair of images, you can see turbo just converges and cleans it up. Its roughly .7 base and rest turbo. Whatever base makes, turbo \"refines\". In second pair, I went opposite, letting base do about .2 and turbo the rest. This gives the most changes, keeps base as composition but takes good liberties.\n\nI suppose you probably get it now why I said LoRa on turbo makes more sense. You let slow base make the framework in smaller part of the cycle and then let faster turbo converge quickly. This could be opposite if base has some exceptional benefit in using LoRa on it, but I doubt it.\n\nIdeally you have to find the proper pass on point between the models. Also if same LoRa works on both models, why not both with different strengths, again based on transition.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8k9kxm5ggihg1.jpeg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9877819a55c69102fd7fda997bc3818312d05064\n\nEdit: Test with no LoRa, cause I haven't made or found one I want to use yet.",
