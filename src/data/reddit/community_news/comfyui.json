I’ve recently installed Wan 2.2 in ComfyUI and I’m currently learning how to use it by watching tutorials.\n\nI would really appreciate some help with a ComfyUI workflow specifically designed to upscale low-resolution sprites into high-quality sprites. My use case is images only (not videos).\n\nIdeally, I’m looking for a workflow that:\n\n•Takes a PNG image with transparency (alpha channel) as input\n\n•Upscales the sprite to a higher resolution (for example, 4K)\n\n•Preserves the original design, proportions, and sprite positioning\n\n•Respects and keeps the transparency\n\n•Outputs the final image as PNG with transparency\n\n\nIf anyone has a ComfyUI workflow using Wan 2.2 (or a compatible setup) that works well for sprite upscaling, I would be very grateful if you could share it or explain the node setup.",

You can upload 1 frame of any character's sprite as the source and ask any Edit model (Qwen Edit, Flux Kontext, Flux 2) to turn this sprite into a super-realistic image and character description.\n\nAs a result, we will get the first frame in a realistic style.\n\nStage 2: running the new image through WAN 2.2 animate based on reference pixel animation; possibly, the pixel animation was smoothed to 60 FPS for Animate to work more correctly. (I am 99% sure that the author used Wan Animate, since the first video in this format on the author's channel was dated 4 months ago, just when Wan Animate was created).\n\nIf you want to use the same method, it is better to pay attention to the new Wan Animate 2.2 v2 model or WAN 2.1 SCAIL, which works much better with transferring reference animations than Wan 2.2 Animate.\n\nI personally tested these two models. Wan 2.2 Animate V2 gives a more creative picture and can move the camera and animate the background, but it transfers movements worse, while WAN 2.1 SCAIL better preserves the consistency of the characters and transfers animations better.\n\nI think in your case it is better to use WAN SCAIL.",

Is it simply a desirable feature, or is there a specific use case where it’s necessary? Does Instagram’s ranking improve when the watermark is removed?",

There's almost no cohesion between cuts, and some editorial work is needed to make things flow together properly.\n\nYou need to research some film-making, framing, composition and such. Stuff like the dude shooting forwards, then upwards look like unrelated actions, they don't flow together, there's no need to use the entire clip every time, cut it and disperse 1-2 second of him shooting and the machine reacting.\n\nThe car scene with the shotgun and the drone blowing up look completely unrelated, you should've brought that clip in an editing software and start the cut with the drone blowing up. Right now it looks like the dude shoots in the wrong direction, and the drone blows up by itself a few seconds later, there should also be a shot of the drone approaching from afar, it feels like it just spawns behind the car like a videogame.\n\nDo not randomly use cross-dissolves or fades to black, those type of transitions have meaning, their purpose is to distance cuts, creating the feeling of time passing or location changes, not blending cuts together, actual cuts work better for that.\n\nUse LoRAs for actions the AI doesn't know how to work with, the dude putting his entire mouth around the neck of the bottle looks really weird.\n\nLastly, everything looks like it's in slow motion, use an editing software to accelerate the movement if needed.\n\nI know it may seem harsh and it's unpleasant to read this, but if I just say that it's good when it isn't, you aren't gonna get any better.",

I’ve been wanting these capabilities to come into fruition 2 decades ago but I thought it would be just a fantasy in my lifetime. I’m glad you stated in your oc that the intention wasn’t to pass this off as an actual short film even tho it is an amateur one at that I commend the time and effort you spent in making this as it motivates me to do something of this scale as I personally just bought a 3090fe. I’m slowly building up to a full build. I have tried wan 2.2 and it’s impressive. I see commenters who are giving it harsh criticism and it’s well deserved, but I also think is better than what amateurs can do atm. I’m hoping this makes its way to skilled storytellers and someone can step up and give us a proper film made with ai.  But thanks for sharing. It’s very motivating for me to look forward to using these tools and also learn how to tell good stories with these tools. Keep going and keep sharing take the constructive criticism you get and make some adjustments along the way.",

And the temptation to misuse this tool is ever present. What man doesn't want the ability to undress - anyone. And far more than simply undress, Sure it's unethical, but so long as you're not posting it and it's only happening in private between you and your PC, it's hard to argue what, if any, harm is being done. If there is any harm being done it's probably just to myself.\n\nI feel like I'm genuinely qualified to teach a class on AI porn using Comfy. Need a Bachelor of AI porn? I'm your proff lol\n\nI agree with OP. I wouldn't know nearly as much about ComfyUI (or AI in general) without the lure of Porn.\n\nHaving said that, there IS more that it can do.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nTo better support the continued growth of the project and improve our internal workflows, we are going to officially moved the **ComfyUI** repository from the u/comfyanonymous account to its new home at the [Comfy-Org](https://github.com/comfy-org) organization. We want to let you know early to set clear expectations, maintain transparency, and make sure the transition is smooth for users and contributors alike.\n\n# What does this mean for you?\n\n* **Redirects:** No need to worry, **GitHub will automatically redirect all existing links, stars, and forks to the new location**.\n* **Action Recommended:** While redirects are in place, we recommend updating your local git remotes to point to the new URL: [`https://github.com/comfy-org/ComfyUI.git`](https://github.com/comfy-org/ComfyUI.git)\n   * Command:\n      * `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI.git`\n   * You can do this already as we already set up the current mirror repo in the proper location.\n* **Continuity:** This is an organizational change to help us manage the project more effectively.\n\n# Why we’re making this change?\n\nAs ComfyUI has grown from a personal project into a cornerstone of the generative AI ecosystem, we want to ensure the infrastructure behind it is as robust. Moving to **Comfy Org** allows us to:\n\n* **Improve Collaboration:** An organization account allows us to manage permissions for our growing core team and community contributors more effectively. This will allow us to transfer individual issues between different repos\n* **Better Security:** The organization structure gives us access to better security tools, fine-grained access control, and improved project management features to keep the repo healthy and secure.\n* **AI and Tooling:** Makes it easier for us to integrate internal automation, CI/CD, and AI-assisted tooling to improve testing, releases, and contributor change review over time.\n\n# Does this mean it’s easier to be a contributor for ComfyUI?\n\nIn a way, yes. For the longest time, the repo only had a single person (comfyanonymous) to review and guarantee code quality. While this list of people is still small now as we bring more people onto the project, we are going to do better overtime to accept more community input to the codebase itself and **eventually setup longterm open governance structure for the ownership of the project**.\n\n\n\nOur commitment to open source remains the same, this change will push us to further enable even more community collaboration, faster iteration, and a healthier PR and review process as the project continues to scale.\n\n\n\nThank you for being part of this journey!",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this. As you requested, I cleaned up the workflow. I added another upscale method (QWEN Edit 2511) which I think better than SeedVR. SeedVR is still there just bypassed. The workflow is horizontal rather than cramped over each other. It is divided into sections as per the developer (QWEN, SDXL, Detailers, zimage, controlnet, upscale by QIE 2511 and then optional upscale by seedvr. I did not alter settings or lines wiring. This is the original workflow just untangled so you know how it flows by looking at it. I did not run it after cleaning it, because I don't have the models and some nodes are missing (tagger and seedvr2) and since I don't have use for this concept, I didn't feel like downloading everything. Again, the workflow should work as if it was the original. I didn't alter or change anything in the original workflow.

🚀\n\n**PSA: this training method guaranteed to maintain all the styles that come with the model, for example :y*****ou can literally have your character in in the style of sponge bob show chilling at the crusty crab with sponge bob and have sponge bob intact alongside of your character who will transform to the style of the show!!*** **just thought to throw this out there.. and no this will not break a 6b parameter model and I'm talking at strength 1.00 lora as well. remember guys you have the ability to change the strength of your lora as well. Cheers!!**\n\n**🚨 IMPORTANT UPDATE ⚡ Why Simple Captioning Is Essential**\n\nI’ve seen some users struggling with distorted features or “mushy” results. If your character isn’t coming out clean, you are likely over-captioning your dataset.\n\nz-image handles training differently than what you might be used to with SDXL or other models.\n\n**🧼 The “Clean Label” Method**\n\nMy method relies on a minimalist caption.\n\nIf I am training a character who is a man, my caption is simply:\n\nman\n\n**🧠 Why This Works (The Science) • The Sigmoid Factor**\n\nThis training process utilizes a Sigmoid schedule with a high initial noise floor. This noise does not “settle” well when you try to cram long, descriptive prompts into the dataset.\n\n**• Avoiding Semantic Noise**\n\nHeavy captions introduce unnecessary noise into the training tokens. When the model tries to resolve that high initial noise against a wall of text, it often leads to:\n\nDisfigured faces\n\nLoss of fine detail\n\n**• Leveraging Latent Knowledge**\n\nYou aren’t teaching the model what clothes or backgrounds are, it already knows. By keeping the caption to a single word, you focus 100% of the training energy on aligning your subject’s unique features with the model’s existing 6B-parameter intelligence.\n\n**• Style Versatility**\n\nThis is how you keep the model flexible.\n\nBecause you haven’t “baked” specific descriptions into the character, you can drop them into any style, even a cartoon. and the model will adapt the character perfectly without breaking.\n\n[original post with discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1ppy4t0/my_final_zimageturbo_lora_training_setup_full/) \\-*deleted but discussion still there*, **this is the same exact post btw just with adding few things and not removing anything from previous one**\n\n***Additionally, here is full fp32 model merge:***\n\n***Full fp32 model here :*** [***https://civitai.com/models/2266472?modelVersionId=2551132***](https://civitai.com/models/2266472?modelVersionId=2551132)\n\n**Credit for:**\n\n[**Tongyi-MAI For the ABSOLUTE UNIT OF A MODEL**](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI)\n\n[**Ostris And his Absolute legend of A training tool and Adapter**](https://github.com/ostris)\n\n[**ClownsharkBatwing For the amazing RES4LYFE SAMPLERS**](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing)\n\n[**erosDiffusion For Revealing Flowmatch Scheduler**](https://github.com/erosDiffusion)",

But if you prefer 1024 you can absolutely do that it’s just going to be slower during training. But I would be more than glad if you dm me and discuss this further as there could be a different underlying problem. Bc during training I noticed that z-image interpret some words entirely differently, i tested that with the model without LoRA’s to check which words are interpreted differently and there was a big chunk of at least what I tested, reason I’m saying this is if the model interpreted a word differently it could potentially have initial noise of wrong colors or parts and that would go into your training which is bad thing. And since we are using Sigmoid Timestep that’s a quick initial high noise basically which could cause a blend of chaos if we choose the wrong words as a caption.",

There are many that give such unique representations of the world that the model likely doesn't recognize a lot of what's going on in the image. Qwen Edit, for instance, had little concept of anything in a western comic panel from the 80s that I gave it. This tells me that I actually do need to describe the scene and people.\n\n2. Also, if you're training a character, what if you want to allow for clothing changes, when the only data you have is their standard costume? Then should you describe their clothing? Or maybe just say \"action outfit\" to imply that it can be changed?\n\n3. Finally, does this method of using a new checkpoint mean that the lora will be less compatible with the standard checkpoint that everyone is using?",

I think there are easier ways with the quest 3 like some apps that can view them directly without Gracia or oculus link but my way works for me and I access them directly on my computer via link.\n\nThe blender/supersplat editing are optional but usually you want to at least align the splat a bit and clean the crap far away in the image like clouds and sun . \n\nApple SHARP has two different workflows (I'm talking about ComfyUI), one with exif and the other without. Your lens depth of field is important so if your image has no exif metadata (like any AI slop, even if you prompt \"35mm camera\"), you have to tell SHARP the mm of the supposed lens. A number too high makes your character elongated with Cyrano's nose and too low and everything is flat. Trial and error. \n\nI'm not going to explain how to use ComfyUI, how to install Apple Sharp inside it, how to use/find supersplat, how to find/use the Gaussian Splat python Blender add-on, or explain how to get SteamVR to work with the Quest OpenXR. It's all on the Internet, that's where I found how. There is no 1-button function... Yet. \n\nGive it 2-3 weeks at best. Maybe 2-3 days before ads start popping up for \"free\"  online 1-photo Gaussian Splat converters and viewers and editor and data mining you at the same time.\n\nLooking at Gaussian Splats on VR is not new, but creating one so good from one picture for Christmas is like getting a blowjob from Jesus but with Santa pushing on his head.",

The statue is made of smooth matte black marble, creating a striking contrast between the impossibly black woman and the white beach chair. The statue appears to absorb light rather than reflect it due to the nature of the matte black marble. The statue lacks fine details, instead depicting an impressionist silhouette of a woman. The statue sits outside on a beach with pure white sand, on a background of calm desaturated teal sea water and a pale baby blue sky on a cloudy day in the late afternoon. The photograph captures the statue at a side profile on a long shot and centers the subject in the frame.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe statue should be wearing a black bikini. The statue should be b the color black (#000) to attempt to obscure specific details of the woman, instead highlighting her silhouette.",

Let me know if I say something that's wrong, please:  \n \\- Templates load the whole graph, they don't load on top of the workspace you have opened.  \n \\- So the only way to use templates like how I am proposing SugarCubes is to copy the workflow segment you have saved as a template and paste it into the workflow you're actually working on  \n \\- Comfy DOES have a built in feature called \"Template Packs\" but there is no way to create them in modern ComfyUI. Template Packs actually can be loaded in on top of workflows rather than opening a new one, and this is very similar to if not the same path that copy/paste uses\n\nUltimately I want a more organized and sharable way to create these kinds of workflow segments. Saving your segments in separate template files is clever, but it's not a full solution like Cubes will be, at least not for the problem I have.\n\nI should note, subgraphs are very very close to what I want. My main problem with subgraphs is really just the way the abstraction was implemented. Subgraphs can be \"published\" which saves them for later and makes them nodes in the node lookup. That's great!\n\nBut I find myself using them primarily for smaller workflow sections rather than larger steps in the workflow because a subgraph can make things harder to reason about when used for larger sections - at least for me. Seeing one node with a big stack of inputs is unwieldy, though it's excellent that we can zoom into subgraphs when we need to reason about those sections more deeply.\n\nSubgraphs often have many inputs and outputs just like a normal node. Cubes are best when they only have one input and one output. It involves a more compartmentalized style of graph building. There is nothing stopping you from doing it with subgraphs, though!",

Let me know if I say something that's wrong, please:*  \n*- Templates load the whole graph, they don't load on top of the workspace you have opened.*\n\nThat's not the way they work. They only load what you saved in the template and and can be added to any workflow. There is no copy/pasting involved.\n\nThe workflow in the image:\n\nEvery group is a template that I have saved and I just added them in. No, I wouldn't use all of this like this, but, I could. It flows. If there is a group in there that I decide that I don't want to use, I can bypass or delete it.\n\nSearge: I enter a prompt and it enhances it and then sends it to the Prompt from filesx3 node.\n\nPrompt From Filesx3: It lets you load up to 3 simple text files that contain prompts. It works similar to wildcards. The 2 text boxes: the top one is added to the beginning of the prompt, the 2nd one is added to the end. Both are optional. This contains clip text encode nodes which get their clip model from the SDXL subgraph.\n\nControlnet: the created prompt is sent to the Controlnet which processes it and sends it through the heart of the workflow, the SDXL subgraph.\n\nFaceID: it uses the model from the SDXL subgraph, processes it, and then sends it back to be sent through the SDXL subgraph to the ksampler.\n\nThe output of the XL subgraph is sent through an outpaint subgraph(a full outpaint workflow that only needs input and output image nodes) and is outpainted. I could easily make the outpaint node use the same model that is in the XL subgraph. The output of that is sent to the Wan 1st/last subgraph(a full wan workflow that just needs image inputs) and is used as the 1st image. The loose load image node is for the final image for the wan subgraph.\n\nI started this with the SDXL subgraph group and dropped all of the other templates in. No copy/pasting, I just opened the template menu and selected the one that I wanted and clicked on it. The SDXL subgraph is a full workflow that can work with only an output image node connected to it. The other connections do not have to be connected. The switches control the inputs. The ouput connections are just there so it can be used for other things like I did here.\n\nI only show items on the faces of the subgraphs that I may want to change. Everything else is hidden inside.\n\nI'm not saying what you are doing is bad, I'm just showing an alternative that is built in to Comfy. :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d47bvzln3vag1.png?width=3695&format=png&auto=webp&s=03ec1c2e2b822409c9311b505ea97c43bcdf0c91",

Tons of tutorials and workflows, most of which are overwhelming and at odds with each other on node and layout preferences, and so many customizations and downloads that cause conflicts - and then you find something that works and just lean all the way into it lol. Any apps/plugins/extensions that can assist with analyzing and diagnosing the workflow is appreciated. \n\nWhat would be awesome is if there was an app that examined your full startup log (which inevitably displays countless little errors or extra load times after extended use and tons of custom nodes have been installed) and provided remediation steps to speed up the local server loading process.\n\nEven better - imagine if you dragged a workflow *into an app* that analyzed *every* component — not just nodes, but models, LoRAs, etc. — and automatically found, downloaded, *and placed* everything where it should go. Such that any workflow you see is guaranteed to work without you having to *make* it work. \n\nAs long as we’re daydreaming, add a toggle to “optimize workflow for your system” where total size of the workflow will never exceed your VRAM threshold and trigger offloading (meaning the app would swap out a workflow’s model variant for a GGUF that is best for your system, for example).\n\nIf such an app existed, I would happily drop cash for it, and I’m sure I’m not the only one!\n\nAnyway, thanks for your work on this 👍🏻",

Start with ep. 1 and watch the first few to get up and running, then you can jump around to whichever topic is most relevant once you have the basics.\n\n-use the comfy UI \"templates\" to get started. Any workflow that's embedded in a civitai image or video will almost certainly not be beginner friendly.\n\n-images first, then video. Images are way easier and faster to get up and running. Idk why but I struggled to get my first video gen for days. Just couldn't figure it out, until I went back and tried the built in template.\n\n-chatGPT \n\n-browse civitai to find what you like, then look at the information on the right to see what models of other settings they used. \n\nNote: you asked about NSFW, but it's all the same. Pretty much all of them will do \"softcore\" images and videos out of the gate, especially without nudity, so you don't really need an NSFW model to get up and running. In fact it's probably better to get familiar with the base models capabilities beforehand. The base models are generally very well done and more beginner friendly.  The NSFW specific stuff is usually more focused, which in turn makes them harder to use, and if they're poorly trained they can degrade the output, as well.\n\nMy starting point was a simple Qwen text-to-image template built into comfy UI.

Such as dependency hell, making custom node installation process stricter and more reliable, proper versioning correspondence between core and custom, enforcing datatyping properly, creating a more granular node installation scheme (so users don't need to install 200 nodes for the one they actually use),  adding equivalents to the most popular custom nodes into core, fixing the horribly inefficient code for adding tasks to the queue (which gets slower the more things you add in one go).\n\nHow many pointless interface tweaks have there been in the time it took to add a mask preview node? How many more will there be before there's a gaussian blur mask node in core?\n\nHonestly don't know what's going on over there.",

OP reached out and said his accounts got hacked.\n\nThere was a user who went by CAPTIAN01R who made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1ppy4t0/my_final_zimageturbo_lora_training_setup_full/) which contained both what he believed were the best training settings for Z-Image Turbo training as well as the best workflow to test the settings with. For whatever reason, I refreshed the page today and noticed he deleted both his post and account, which is a big disappointment given that his tips helped me not only get better quality LoRAs, but train faster too. Unfortunately I cannot go back and paste exactly what he said but these were some of the key takeaways from my memory:\n\n1. Train on the v2 Training Adapter LoRA. *(From my own experience)* I noticed that LoRAs trained on the training adapter seem to perform much better when paired with the controlnet model for inpainting versus if you train on the DeTurbo checkpoint.\n2. Do not use a quantized version of the transformer or text encoder\n3. Do not resize your dataset. Rather, train your high quality images only on 512 (Untick 768 and 1024)\n4. If your dataset is bigger, you can increase the training steps from 3000 to 5000. I think he mentioned you can theoretically go beyond that without the model breaking (Personal note: In the couple character LoRAs I've trained, I ended up using step 2000 despite having 40-60 picture datasets)\n5. Do not caption your datasets. He mentioned that he would set the trigger word to \"man\" or \"woman\" however I personally would just use the person's name and it works fine, if not better. Also I personally wouldn't substitute letters for numbers like how a lot of SDXL/Flux loras do, cause I found it'll try to put the trigger word either on a t-shirt or on a sign in the background somewhere. Remember that Z-Image is trained heavily on natural language.\n6. Preprocess your datasets with SeedVR2. I will include a workflow which I found from a different post, which will allow you to choose either one image at a time, or load images from a directory.\n\nMost importantly, here are the resources:\n\n* [AI-Toolkit settings](https://pastebin.com/G9LcSitA) (Go under \"Show Advanced\" and paste this in)\n* [LoRA test workflow](https://pastebin.com/CAufsJG7)\n* [SeedVR2 workflow](https://pastebin.com/V45m29sF) (and here's [the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1pi2pxu/when_an_upscaler_is_so_good_it_feels_illegal/) I got it from)\n\nAdditionally, for the test workflow [this is where to get the UltraFlux-Vae](https://huggingface.co/Owen777/UltraFlux-v1/blob/main/vae/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors). It's not required but I recommend using it for reasons shown why [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1plqo81/increased_detail_in_zimages_when_using_ultraflux/).\n\nNow I'm no expert when it comes to LoRA training, I've only really trained based on following other people's instructions, but I will try to answer any questions the best I can. I put this together because I want to continue to see the Z-Image and Comfy community thrive and I was lucky enough to have the pastebin links in my search history to make this post. Merry Christmas everyone!",

He said to caption the images the way you would normally prompt. I only trained character LoRAs so maybe it's worth captioning style LoRAs for better results. He captioned what was going on in the dataset pictures without saying it was a children's drawing.\n\nAs for step count, that entirely depends on how many pictures are in your dataset. I'd recommend starting with like 15-25 images and training for 2000-3000 steps and see if you're content with that. I've downloaded style loras trained on both small and large datasets alike and both came out good imo.",

I trained a character for 6000 steps, 30 images, saved every 250 steps, no captions, pretty much standard settings besides that.\n\nGoing beyond step 2000 (where the likeness starts to be okay) the model loses the capability to make a simple pencil drawing of the character and it starts to become a photo more and more.\n\nI've trained another LoRA with 30 images, but used 512, 768 and 1024 resolution, 5000 steps, other settings identical and captioned every image manually. Even at the full 5000 steps, a pencil drawing is still a rough sketch as prompted, with very good likeness. Took way more time - but the results are far better than the suggested settings of this post.\n\nSo yeah - capping out at 512 and/or not captioning the dataset seem to be more harm than good.",

She is resting her head on one hand, looking into the distance. Busy street in the background, at dusk, blue hour, bright headlights.\n\nSo yeah, quite detailed. For \"subject\" insert the name of the character. But: even though it worked out better than the boo caption 512 only method doesn't mean it's perfect. Clothing that works good in prompts without LORA may not work with LORA enabled. A lot of times it looks quite different, and you have to prompt around, try different things to get it right. But at least I can put the character in different art styles without any issue.",

An alternative is unlikely due to the high cost of storing and quickly transfering a large set of models and LoRA's.\n\nPeople have a poor understanding of the financial reasons why Civ is having to do the agressive moderation they are doing - these are largely determined by payment processing companies, and why there are unlikely to be alternatives under current conditions. A site like Civ has a large operating cost, and with very few options for collecting revenue, it's a difficult business proposition, under the best of circumstances.",

Yes ! you’re right. The current parser is still very ComfyUI-centric. Improving support for Flux, non-standard SD pipelines, and Civitai images is definitely on the roadmap ;) \n\n\t•\tLoRAs display integration good call. They deserve their own UI instead of being buried in the prompt. But editing without corrupting metadata is a hard requirement. If is a recurrent demande, I will work on that. \n\n\t•\tUI customization / low-spec mode totally agreed. A thumbnails-off / filename-only option for slower machines makes total sense. Good Point !! \n\n\t•\tScrollbar bug: thanks for catching it , that’s a real issue, I’ll fix it.\n\nGlad the rendering feels smooth 🙂\nFeedback like this is exactly what helps shape the project in the right direction ! feel free to keep it coming. 🙏",

When someone fits a LoRA, it is often the case that they fit adaptors for both the CLIP model and the UNet model.\n\nIn ComfyUI lingo, the UNet alone is often referred to as \"the model\". The `LoraLoaderModelOnly` node loads the UNet component of the LoRA without the CLIP model component. You aren't using the entire LoRA, you're just using the UNet part.\n\nAs the LoRA stack node is just a convenience wrapper, it doesn't drop the CLIP adaptor part of the LoRA. You aren't comparing apples to apples. \n\nThe node you want is just called `Load LoRA`. It takes a model (purple) and CLIP (yellow) as input and returns a model and CLIP as outputs. You want to chain these nodes, not `LoraLoaderModelOnly`. You need to apply the LoRA adaptors for the CLIP piece as well.",

Those extra loras i've used are probably very asian trained dataset, as I did not reviewed their quality and only used them for testing. Maybe something I can try is to have stronger prompt guidance like \"caucasian girl\" or even add extra lora toward caucasian. Thanks for pointing out some improvements to be made!

Another way is also use a more compressed version of the I2V wan model (a compressed gguf version). Note that most of the above will impact quality, but select the compression / combination of tricks that matches the max you can get for your hardware. Hope that helps!",

Now, this wasn't possible just the other day. The whole system would crash. \n\nWhat did I do to make this happen?\n\nI manually set a page file of 133GB (no reason for that number. I aimed at 135 GB) in an NVMe drive. Now I have 197 GB of available RAM to be \"committed,\" and that made a MASSIVE difference. The whole comfyui is smooth, VAE decode doesn't lag when it starts doing its thing. The browser don't crash. And I can ran massive models.\n\nAnd the most important thing is that there is no speed loss. I guess page file allows the GPUs to actually load what must be loaded into VRAM and offload the rest into RAM + Paging file. \n\nI can't stress just how helpful this was. \n\nI don't claim this is the second coming of jesus or anything like that. Just try it and see if it helps your workload. Or not.\n\nP.S. I can also simultaneously use local LLMs like Jan with 20B Q8 GPT OSS. But it does take like 5 min to load it into page file, afterwards it just flies even if it doesn't use VRAM from the GPU. But I do have an i7 Ultra 265. Still. Running 3 AIs simultaneously shouldn't be possible, yet page file absolutely made it happen.\n\nP.P.S. I also keep like 250 tabs open in the browser for other unrelated stuff. It's genuinely crazy what a page file can do.\n\nHope this is helpful to someone considering that ram and vram prices appear to be ready to skyrocket.",

You can make it faster by reducing it, but then risk more shifting.\n\nThe upcoming full SCAIL model (as this is still a preview version) is supposed to have built-in extension method similar to WanAnimate, which would then be multiple times faster than using context windows.",

I suppose it might end up doing a lot of RAM/VRAM shuffling after a certain point which makes it much slower. Not much more that can be done about that. I tried a 1000 frame run too, but ran out of RAM/VRAM at some point, with 64GB system RAM. This was with Block Swap at 40. If you can forgo things like block swap, and fit the frames with torch compile in VRAM it would certainly be faster, but that's not going to be a lot of frames at 1280x720 res. The appeal of SCAIL is the longer videos to me, so it's just going to require a bunch of swapping that comes with a time penalty.",

So you'd get a face swap, but not be able to build a library of quality references for training a LoRA etc.\n\nAnd if you have a lot of reference images you make a LoRA.\n\nAnd if you have just one or two images, you're stuck as basically all your face swaps will have to be the person looking in the same way as the references which is pretty limiting.\n\n\nImo, Qwen 2509 is the best overall tool for taking a random single image, improving it, and then applying it to a swap. Kinda a two step process. Possibly better than Qwen 2511.\n\n\nFlux 2 seems a bit squiffy. Maybe if you just have tons of compute and don't mind doing 10 repeats and digging out the best and working like that, then fine.\n\nBut Qwen is better as you can also do 10 repeats in the same time as 1 flux2 run, and then pick out the best, and then do other work on an image.\n\n\nAlso if you have just one image and want to create a library of quality extrapolations then I find WAN 2.2 unbeatable for seemingly dragging a single reference image into many and then doing face turns and building up a base set for then creating a LoRA from.\nBut obviously this route is quite time consuming.",

It allows you to create unique characters with a consistent appearance across all images, organise them, manage emotions, clothing, poses, and conduct a full cycle of work with characters.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/py0n9nczibag1.png?width=2979&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9a4a2b1880947cd0d6db9d38a9fad33c76dcebf\n\nUsage \n\nStep 1: Create a Base Character\n\nOpen the workflow VN\\_Step1\\_QWEN\\_CharSheetGenerator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o3v0znv0jbag1.png?width=2979&format=png&auto=webp&s=57924c72a5a67141e29aaf5acca8ec525d3109d2\n\n\n\nVNCCS Character Creator\n\nFirst, write your character's name and click the ‘Create New Character’ button. Without this, the magic won't happen.\n\nAfter that, describe your character's appearance in the appropriate fields.\n\nSDXL is still used to generate characters. A huge number of different Loras have been released for it, and the image quality is still much higher than that of all other models.\n\nDon't worry, if you don't want to use SDXL, you can use the following workflow. We'll get to that in a moment.\n\nNew Poser Node\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/erahyew2jbag1.png?width=2979&format=png&auto=webp&s=82acda410e03a9d4521af5771acb3759d49dd268\n\nVNCCS Pose Generator\n\nTo begin with, you can use the default poses, but don't be afraid to experiment!\n\nAt the moment, the default poses are not fully optimised and may cause problems. We will fix this in future updates, and you can help us by sharing your cool presets on our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/9Dacp4wvQw) server!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ju3eznw7jbag1.png?width=2979&format=png&auto=webp&s=df43b9a8789c9fbf162f655cb07bd579528d8bc4\n\nStep 1.1 Clone any character\n\n\n\nTry to use full body images. It can work with any images, but would \"imagine\" missing parst, so it can impact results.\n\nSuit for anime and real photos\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izf7d2s8jbag1.png?width=3320&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ea1d6e0cea7908896dd8a96d61e1fd636df2a70\n\nStep 2 ClothesGenerator\n\nOpen the workflow VN\\_Step2\\_QWEN\\_ClothesGenerator.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whlwu1t9jbag1.png?width=2979&format=png&auto=webp&s=29a1885474a2b32e0991df117835a69e22accf4d\n\nClothes helper lora are still in beta, so it can miss some \"body parts\" sizes. If this happens - just try again with different seeds.\n\nSteps 3, 4 and 5 are not changed, you can follow old guide below.\n\nBe creative! Now everything is possible!",
