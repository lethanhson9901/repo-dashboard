The problem is most of these services don't give you terminal access - so I couldn't use Claude Code with them.\n\nComfy Pilot has two parts:\n\n\\- MCP server - gives Claude Code full access to your workflow (view, edit, connect nodes, run, preview images). Works with any local setup.\n\n\\- Embedded terminal - runs Claude Code right inside the ComfyUI browser tab. Useful when you're on a remote instance with no shell access.\n\nInstall: comfy node install comfy-pilot\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot](https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot)\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

Like the MCP server basically has full access to everything (filesystem, downloads, running code) and there's not really any auth or sandboxing going on.

Also the auto-downloading models from arbitrary URLs and that curl-to-bash installer situation makes me nervous lol. And I'd definitely want some kind of confirmation before it starts deleting nodes or installing random packages.\n\nAnyway keep building man, this is cool as hell even if I gotta sit this one out for now",

I started off in the Disco Diffusion era and made tons of guides on how to use it because there were so many settings and I cannot stand using apps because I want full control over every single parameter and use custom models,loras etc.\n\n\n\n",

Back then Ethan (ethansmith2000) wrote a ton of stuff on it, and provided some of the best guides and cross-testing stuff around in that era imo. You wouldn't happen to be him, would you?\n\nThere was also a little niche Discord that started off somewhere else (can't remember), but ethan, myself and a few others frequented it - but I can't remember the name of that either (my memory is kind of shite these days).\n\nAnd yeah, I'm not a huge fan of apps either. I like the freedom that ComfyUI provides and I use it exclusively these days (outside of some occasional post and tinkering).\n\nCheers. :)\n\nEdit: apologies for the offbeat cadence and occasional redundancy, it's getting late here and I'm absolutely knackered lol.

I won’t even get into the fact that many of them have zero visual sense and their generated stuff often looks bad. -\\_-\n\nAnyway, I’m really curious how much is AI actually being used in your area of VFX?",

This project startet small and grew very quickly, and after a few more copy and pastes it looked like this which amused me quite a bit so I postet it on reddit.\n\nI do not intend to actually use this, I did a last \"test-run\" this night and it passed and now I have no Idea what to do with it. But I knew that before and it did not bother me.\n\nIf you wonder what this workflow does:\n\n\\- Takes one input image and creates a few hundred variation of that image with different background, different general styles etc.\n\n\\- Some things like the background are random and some thing are always the same for specific Image (e.g. the first generated Image is always cartoon style but the background is random)\n\n\\- It saves the Images with a specific output Name based on the Style and the Input Image Name.\n\n\\- Most generated Images are based on the input Image but some are based on previous generated Images from the same run.\n\nNow I will move forward to video creation, I'm curios how this will end up. And who knows,  maybe I can combine my video workflow with this Image workflow :D",

Obviously this depends on context, because someone might have used an old camera to take the picture. And real photos can be edited, which might make them look fake too.\n\nThis isn't criticism of your work - there is nothing wrong with making old looking photos and you should make whatever you like. I'm just saying that people should pay attention to image quality when spotting fakes.",

Small sacrifice for a bigger win, and something I was stubbornly against at first.\n\nSecond, I focused on fixing the color degradation. I tried color matching, but it introduced its own issues. Tried boosting saturation, but the colors looked unnatural. Then, out of curiosity, I tweaked the contrast instead and that basically gave the cleanest result.\n\nIn short, those two tiny changes turned out to be the workable solution.",

With this model, I got consistent and acceptable results. So I guess the NSFW merge is a requirement for this workflow? I suggest documenting that so other users don't have to hunt down the model like I did. \n\n- Just a thought: Is there a strength parameter or something that your SVI/FLF2V node could expose to make it work better with stock Wan models? A growing percentage of the world is becoming unable to access CivitAI, so not everybody is going to be able to download that checkpoint.   \n\nAnyway, thanks for this. If I can get your node to perform better with stock Wan, I can see myself using this in my own workflows. It might be a step forward.",

Has your setup (Wan 2.2 + Speed LoRA + SVI 2 Pro LoRA) worked in other SVI workflows?\n\nBecause my workflow or the node shouldn't cause issues. I loaded Wan models from here: https://huggingface.co/QuantStack/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-GGUF/tree/main, Speed LoRAs from here: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan\\_2.2\\_ComfyUI\\_Repackaged/tree/main/split\\_files/loras, and SVI LoRAs from here: https://huggingface.co/Kijai/WanVideo\\_comfy/tree/main/LoRAs/Stable-Video-Infinity/v2.0 and they worked fine, although the results lacked the dynamics I get with the FastMove fine-tune I'm using (NSFW is just a nice bonus, not the main cause).\n\nBut you're right, I should probably add that info to the workflow. Didn't think about it, I was so used to my current setup that it completely slipped my mind. Thanks for pointing that out.",

If you use 0.5 with it, KSampler would add less noise then before, because last 50% steps for kl_optimal is mostly small adjustments, while for simple it's something more difficult.\n\n\nSo if you want to use kl_optimal here, you need to decide on denoise value, and for that you\n1) get actual_denoise from your 0.5 with the first node (that's where you set simple scheduler, which schedule is used to understand how much noise is actually there on 50% of steps)\n2) get usual denoise from actual_noise (and there you set kl_optimal to understand on which step kl_optimal adds the same amount of actual_noise as simple does on 50% of the steps)\n\n\nIt may be a bit tricky to understand, but to put it simply:\n1) fix scheduler in the first node and use denoise values suitable for that scheduler\n2) vary scheduler in the second node without worrying about suitable denoise values",

I created this with a combination of a depth map and a pose map, merged in one picture so that Flux.2 Klein 9B could create this out of a picture where the man was standing near the bollard in his original pose, which I had created with Flux.2 Klein before.\n\nCreating such a picture from a depth map and a pose SVG using InkScape was a no brainer and done in less than five minutes. I am not a Blender user but I would guess doing it with Blender would be a real challenge.\n\nSo, yes, 3d modeling of pose figures has its value but my tool is for a different purpose.",
