Back then was a cryptominer issue, so I stopped trusting random  installs on the host.\n\nFor enhanced security, ComfyUI only gets internet access during updates. Everything is on Docker volumes (no bind mounts) with backup, and I route access through an Nginx proxy inside the container. It's a bit more effort, but worth it. And if something is suspicious, I throw the whole container and start from scratch. (paranoid mode).\nThe performance is very good btw.",

Bind mounts from Windows are just too slow for heavy I/O with lots of small files. (Using two large nvme SSD.)\n* In .wlsconfig, I set memory=92GB. In this case Comfyui has enough RAM available. Sometimes it peaks arround 64GB + (Total Memory: 128GB)\n* I use Restic (Docker version) with a large external SSD. It handles the deduplication and snapshots incredibly well, so even with currently 1.2TB+ of files and models, the backups are incremental and fast.",

As long as you downloaded them within about a day you were fine. Lora creators opened Discords to share their loras, and for a time it was still good. Then Civit cracked down even harder - I rarely see any \"good\" loras get posted there anymore.\n\nNow when you check the Discords of people who used to freely share their loras, they (MQ Lab) now lock them behind decryption codes for supporters only, or (iGoonHub) host them on Fanvue for the low low price of $10 a month.\n\nAnd now the good times have nearly come and gone :(\n\nI suggest you download every lora \"with the potential for abuse\" you could ever want and carefully document exactly what each do and how to prompt for them. We're about to enter a period where countries, politicians and the regular public realize that AI doesn't just put bikinis on people, but allows you to take innocent portraits and make them deepthroat cocks and so much more. The crackdown on such things hasn't even really started yet IMO.\n\nCivitAiArchive should migrate to a server somewhere in the world that doesn't care what any western government thinks because they're gonna start thinking things soon.",

So a lot smaller in VRAM and at runtime, but not going down to an equivalent of like Q3 accuracy or whatever.\n\nBut the issue I then have is I don't use FP8 because I find they're not as accurate as the original FP16 models.\n\nSo this is probably great for LLMs and very very large models like that, because I suppose the accuracy loss is more tolerable or not noticeable, but entire models might now be completely usable where before they were just not usable at all without massive memory, or noticeable loss.\n\nI'm not sure if models developed and trained with NVFP4 in mind can be optimised to be even less lossy? If so then very good.\n\nAt the worst people can just create FP8/FP16 from the NVFP4 models for other hardware that doesn't support NVFP4.\n\nBut I do see an argument coming that because gamers don't need huge VRAM and Nvidia are offering NVFP4, nor do AI users, so hey the new 6000 Pro type cards only come with 64GB VRAM haha. 6090 24GB!",

              "text": "Not stupid, I think it's because the target is for a lower bit quant to look similar to FP8 (which is also a compromise from FP16 but considered acceptable by many).  INT4 loses too much precision and looks garbage for image gen, which is why alternatives like SVDQuant and NVFP4 exist.  SVDQuant and NVFP4 are two different approaches to achieving the same goal, preserving as much 16-bit precision as possible in a 4-bit base format.  The main benefit as I understand it of NVFP4 is the native acceleration on Blackwell, otherwise SVDQuant probably preserves more of the outliers in 16-bit than NVFP4 does and most seem to think it looks a little better.  That said I'm personally pretty impressed with the fidelity and performance of NVFP4 on my 5090 and will probably use that for refining my prompts and only switch to full precision for the final renders (if I feel it's actually necessary).  More info that you asked for but thought it might help others too.  Hopefully I didn't mangle anything in this description :)",

I just, nvidia is so scummy and I'm tired of making really cool breakthroughs and they try and phrase it to milk as much money possible out of everyone by essentially phrasing it as \"buy the 50 series so you can get this benefit\", only to have them later on go \"oh haha now everyone can use it!\", instead of just doing that in the first place.\n\nI get that doesn't generate revenue but if people have already supported the company then jesus christ, they've paid the premium for the update.",

Still very much WIP. I’m testing it internally for my film projects right now, but I’m hoping to clean it up and make it public soon.  When it’s ready, I’ll definitely share it 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",

If you reuse a latent from a previous step (or a whole video) as anchor, you usually get normalization issues, color drift or flicker. That’s why anchors are still expected to be a single still image, shared across all segments. What works better is keeping the anchor fixed and letting continuity happen via conditioning, seeds and motion injection, not by changing the anchor itself.\nI’m testing latent-to-latent anchoring, but without proper re-normalization it tends to be worse than the original setup.\nSo yeah — cool idea, just not stable enough yet in the current WAN pipeline.",

It's an 11-year-old HP Pavilion H8-1234, and I never spent a dime on it until now, and I just realized it was bottlenecking on the RAM. \n\nComfyUI was utilizing anywhere from 78 to 95% of my RAM (it's a really old AMD GPU, so I have to use CPU mode)...so as you can imagine I only used ComfyUI when I wasn't doing anything else too RAM extensive, and even then sometimes it would max and crash. \n\nIt only had 10gb of ram...2x4gb Kingston sticks + 1 2gb HP stick...all installed in the wrong slots, causing my PC to be in single-channel mode. I honestly just thought this PC sucked. So today I got 2x8gb timetecs on my journey to eventually upgrade it to 32gb. So I remove the 1 2gb and install the new RAM, moving everything in its proper place. Now ComfyUI loads up fast, the model is loaded into memory super fast (before it took like 1-2 minutes to load the model), and it only uses 38 to 60ish % of my RAM.\n\nThanks for reading, I just needed to share this bit of exciting (to me) news lol.",
