The problem is most of these services don't give you terminal access - so I couldn't use Claude Code with them.\n\nComfy Pilot has two parts:\n\n\\- MCP server - gives Claude Code full access to your workflow (view, edit, connect nodes, run, preview images). Works with any local setup.\n\n\\- Embedded terminal - runs Claude Code right inside the ComfyUI browser tab. Useful when you're on a remote instance with no shell access.\n\nInstall: comfy node install comfy-pilot\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot](https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot)\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

Like the MCP server basically has full access to everything (filesystem, downloads, running code) and there's not really any auth or sandboxing going on.

Also the auto-downloading models from arbitrary URLs and that curl-to-bash installer situation makes me nervous lol. And I'd definitely want some kind of confirmation before it starts deleting nodes or installing random packages.\n\nAnyway keep building man, this is cool as hell even if I gotta sit this one out for now",

That is exactly what I am doing.\nInstead of relying on preprocessors (like DWPose or ZoeDepth) to \"guess'\" the skeleton and depth from a video, which often results in flickering or jittery limbs, I am rendering the data directly from the 3D scene.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nIt is running Three.js (WebGL) directly inside the ComfyUI frontend. The node handles the 3D scene in the browser, snaps the frame buffers (OpenPose colors, Depth, Canny, Normal), and sends them back to the Python backend. It’s lightweight and doesn't require running a separate heavy application in the background.\n\nI'm not just rendering a stick figure, I have a custom skinned mesh (Geo_OpenPose) where the limbs act as the \"bones\" and are colored with the exact OpenPose ID colors. This handles occlusion perfectly in theory (for instance, if an arm goes behind the body, the bone disappears correctly, whereas preprocessors often get confused and draw the arm on top).\n\nYou are right that Blender is superior for creating or editing the animation. My node is designed for the Generation Pipeline. The workflow is: Create your animation in Blender/Mixamo once -> Import GLB/FBX to Comfy -> Batch render perfect ControlNet passes instantly while tweaking your prompts. \nIt saves you from having to render out thousands of frames in Blender every time you want to test a new camera angle or lighting setup.",

Any idea the cause? 512x512. 10 frames at 24 FPS.\n\nI'm still trying to narrow down the cause, but figured I'd reach out and see if you had any similar issues when using the node?\n\nEdit: It does appear to be something with the action node. I go from 1.7 FPS to 170 FPS when I delete the Action Node. Could it be something to do with the renderer?",

I won’t even get into the fact that many of them have zero visual sense and their generated stuff often looks bad. -\\_-\n\nAnyway, I’m really curious how much is AI actually being used in your area of VFX?",

I actually gave a talk about this at the December ComfyUI meetup in NYC. I'm building an open-source tool called ComfyGit that leverages uv to enable reproducibility and version control: git-tracked environments via a single pyproject.toml manifest where nodes, models, and ComfyUI version are all pinned. The idea is you export a working environment, import it on another machine, and everything just installs and runs. It's available as a custom node via the Manager right now (ComfyGit-Manager is the node name). Here's the [github link](https://github.com/comfygit-ai/comfygit-manager) if interested.  \nWould love to compare approaches, looks like we have different architectures solving a similar problem space!",

This looks promising, I haven't looked further than the readme, but here is what i understood so far: \n\n1. **Versioning:**  I think there are two sides of versions: \n   1. Internal: where each changes is tracked automatically, because as a user can install many packages or nodes, if I missed a commit, I might need to revert all changes, rather than reverting a specific revision. \n   2. External: That's where ComfyGit seems to be more useful, push each change to Git when environment is stable. \n2. **Import/Export ComfyUI env:** Definitely a great job there. \n3. **Running it as Custom Node:** This is where I am a little bit concerned, in case the ComfyUI breaks because of a package or node, This node also becomes unusable. \n\n  \nBut sure we are working on same problem with different approach, would love to chat more & even happy to collaborate on a common project.

Some kind of auto-commit system would certainly be useful, I was worried about node installs and environment configuration leading to lots of 'noise' in the commit history, but if it saves you when needing to rollback then it's probably worth the tradeoff.  \n3. Yep this is why you can also run ComfyGit as a full-featured CLI! If the environment bricks or the orchestrator gets stuck (happens) then I use the CLI to reboot/rollback the environment. Since the core is just a library it can integrate with multiple frontends pretty easily (I'm thinking of adding a standalone launcher in the future).  \nHappy to chat more!",

With the off by default newer users wouldn't need to touch anything, but having it there has saved me from manually editing \\`requirements.txt\\` before installing new nodes like I used to.\n\nNot to into the spaces thing, as adding the overhead of npm dependency mess to python dependency mess isn't as easy as \\`uv\\` but best of luck to you.",

The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

Since the baseline quality of these models differs, it’s hard to compare VACE across them purely by chunk size.\n\nThis works on LongLive, StreamDiffusion v2, and Krea Realtime, etc,  because they’re distilled from Wan 2.1 which is the arch VACE was designed for.

This project startet small and grew very quickly, and after a few more copy and pastes it looked like this which amused me quite a bit so I postet it on reddit.\n\nI do not intend to actually use this, I did a last \"test-run\" this night and it passed and now I have no Idea what to do with it. But I knew that before and it did not bother me.\n\nIf you wonder what this workflow does:\n\n\\- Takes one input image and creates a few hundred variation of that image with different background, different general styles etc.\n\n\\- Some things like the background are random and some thing are always the same for specific Image (e.g. the first generated Image is always cartoon style but the background is random)\n\n\\- It saves the Images with a specific output Name based on the Style and the Input Image Name.\n\n\\- Most generated Images are based on the input Image but some are based on previous generated Images from the same run.\n\nNow I will move forward to video creation, I'm curios how this will end up. And who knows,  maybe I can combine my video workflow with this Image workflow :D",

Detailing on the shoulder pads are asymmetrical, the same goes for the braces, gloves and fingers, thigh armor(?), leg braces, and especially the feet.\n\nOn a more subjective note, this kind of approach tends to add \"too much\" detail. Every surface and part of this image is rugged, grained, and super granular. Even the sky is grainy. The stained glass windows in the back doesn't make sense, the every spire is different and weirdly spiked and shaped. The cloth parts have a very inconsistently spiked metal trim (is that even a thing?), every surface is bumpy/spikey/stained, etc.\n\nNo surface is smooth, clean or flat. It's hard to put into words beyond that, but all of it together screams mediocre AI image if you look at it for more than 10 seconds, at least IMO.\n\nI think that's why it's important to remember inpainting can work to add detail where necessary and appropriate, as well as fix asymmetrical inconsistencies. Applying a blank \"add more detail\" filter rarely works well.\n\nJust my 2 cents though, don't let my critique stop you from enjoying your AI images.",

Creating people would be more in the range of start 50 end 100 bias 10 exponent 1.50... and with adding detail or changing features to already existing images you can take a 512x768 picture and make it a 4k masterpiece with the right settings",

Here are some of my takeaways:\n\nI start by editing the first frame of the video to give it a polished look, combining Gemini's image editing with Photoshop post-processing to make the reference image look refined and realistic. It's not straight out of generation. I find that the reference image and prompt have a huge impact on the overall quality of the output video.\n\nIf you have any suggestions for improving the workflow, please let me know! I'm still learning and experimenting.\n\n(English isn't my first language, feel free to let me know if anything sounds off!)",

Again, photo realistic ZIT. \n\n\"\"a woman is laying on her back, spreading her legs wide, he inserts his huge penis into the woman's vagina, forcefully thrusting his penis deeply into the woman's vagina back and forth, balls deep penetration, all the way in, piston fucking the woman, the woman moans in pleasure, the huge penis is fully penetrating the vagina over and over.\"\n\nPlease someone show me the way to convince the dude in my gens to just go for it, man.",

Everything works fine, but then you want to switch to kl_optimal (which spends more steps on low noise refining). If you use 0.5 with it, KSampler would add less noise then before, because last 50% steps for kl_optimal is mostly small adjustments, while for simple it's something more difficult.\n\n\nSo if you want to use kl_optimal here, you need to decide on denoise value, and for that you\n1) get actual_denoise from your 0.5 with the first node (that's where you set simple scheduler, which schedule is used to understand how much noise is actually there on 50% of steps)\n2) get usual denoise from actual_noise (and there you set kl_optimal to understand on which step kl_optimal adds the same amount of actual_noise as simple does on 50% of the steps)\n\n\nIt may be a bit tricky to understand, but to put it simply:\n1) fix scheduler in the first node and use denoise values suitable for that scheduler\n2) vary scheduler in the second node without worrying about suitable denoise values",
