But it's much slower. At the same time 9b base renders an image with 20 or so steps, I can do 2-3 smaller edits with 4b distilled, multiple edits chained after another or just do quicker edit-generate turns overall. And if you don't overload 4b with too many editing instructions at once, it's pretty capable as I see. 4b seems to struggle with text rendering a bit though.",

I also tested cartoonish images on white backgrounds and sometimes it removes important things, for example, a flower on a vase with a simple color background it should leave the flower AND the vase, but sometimes it removes the flower, other times the vase and so on)\n\nIn this case it shows a bit of what I mean. The grass is part of the whole image, but you can see that the grass was about to be removed but not fully.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8zc5pebsweg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3224f777cc685d993369a07d1c765765ed3cccdc\n\nIn any case, it's a great option with some details.",

I'm still very new to ComfyUI (I usually just do 3D/Unity stuff), but I really wanted to port a personal tool I made into ComfyUI to streamline my workflow.\n\nI originally created this tool as a website to help me self-study cinematic shots, specifically to memorize what different camera angles, lighting setups (like Rembrandt or Volumetric), and focal lengths actually look like (link to the original tool : [https://yedp123.github.io/](https://yedp123.github.io/)).\n\n**What it does:** It replaces the standard CLIP Text Encode node but adds a visual interface. You can select:\n\n* Camera Angles (Dutch, Low, High, etc.)\n* Lighting Styles\n* Focal Lengths & Aperture\n* Film Stocks & Color Palettes\n\nIt updates the preview image in real-time when you hover over the different options so you can see a reference of what that term means before you generate. You can also edit the final prompt string if you want to add/remove things. It outputs the string + conditioning for Stable Diffusion, Flux, Nanobanana or Midjourney.\n\nLike I mentioned above, I just started playing with ComfyUI so I am not sure if this can be of any help to any of you or if there are flaws with it, but here's the link if you want to give it a try. Thanks, Have a good day!\n\n**Links:** [https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt)\n\n***-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***\n\n***UPDATE: added \"Cinematic Reference Loader\", an Image Loader node which lets the user select an image among the image assets to use for Image-to-Image workflows***",

The node doesn't currently have an `IMAGE` output to send them directly to other nodes via wires.\n\nHowever, if you really like a specific reference image (like the \"Low Angle\" shot for instance) and want to use it for ControlNet, you can find all the source images in your `custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Cinematic_Prompt/web/assets/` folder and load them into a standard 'Load Image' node",

I had a case where the stick figure resulting from dwpose preprocessor crossed in the wrong order, with the blue stick crossing over the green stick, rather than the other way round. I just copied the image  from the preview image, painted the crossing green, and used the resulting image as the input for pose, skipping the whole preprocessor this time.\n2. If the dwpose is correct, but flux 2 klein is still not creating the correct pose, support it with a descriptive text prompt. The text prompt I used for the example image was: \"Change the pose of the subject in image2 to the pose in image1. A medium shot of the woman from knees up, leaning against the door frame. The woman is looking to the side, reading a book. Her left arm is hanging down, holding a wine glass. Her right hand is holding a book. Her left leg is lifted at an angle. Her weight rests on her right leg, which is partly obscured by the left leg.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fnxu205dxdg1.png?width=3409&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e20dd8fe5c4185baf1e22c3f38d91d1ac031ff",

You got your smut that does boring shit well. You got your smut that does prompt adherence well (but doesn't beat the boring models at boring shit.)\n\nThe video part is easy. Smutty fine-tunes of Wan2.2 will get any image moving and grooving. Wan 2.2 Enhanced NSFW is number 1 on civitas for a reason. It's the best. Image-to-Image will get you to where ever you want to go, so the problem is thus reduced to an image (de)generation problem.\n\nFor photoreal image smut, you can use Flux or Qwen or Z-Image probably. They will all give you exactly what you want as long as you plug in the right LoRA and are willing to settle for something that is mostly 1girl.\n\nFor anime image smut, a lot of people seem to go for Illustrious or Pony. If you're willing to settle for something mostly 1girl, these models will also trivially do anything you'd ever want.\n\nThe hardest thing is getting 2+ characters interacting without it looking like some horror show dreamed up by the worshippers of slaanesh. The state of the AI art today is that, to get two characters interacting with a lot of prompt adherence, people start sprouting extra fingers and legs and dicks. So you can either wrestle your way through that (with control nets and in-painting and a lot of random chance) or settle for something more generic.",

There are plenty available at Civit but IMO many of the best ones were deleted. Fortunately, you can still find most of them here...\n\nIt's the loras that turn Wan2.2 from PG-13/softcore into XXX hardcore.\n\n[https://civitaiarchive.com/](https://civitaiarchive.com/)\n\nThe only problem with the photorealistic models currently is that none of them go as easily hardcore as Pony or Illustrious. There ARE mixes for realism and they'll get you most of the way there, but they do not look 100% real or like photos.\n\nBut they will create the most hardcore scenes you can probably imagine. Excellent at anatomy in complex positions of \"interactions\" that none of the truly photorealistic models can manage. They weren't trained specifically on porn - Pony was. Skip Pony 7 entirely. In fact you don't want to use ANY of the Pony base models. You want a Pony finetune.\n\nI'd recommend CyberRealisticPony and there are a few others. You can create hardcore XXX with this model. It's fast, has great anatomy and is HIGHLY knowledgeable about practically every sexual act or position you could want, and I love it! But it's NOT quite photorealism.\n\nChroma is an interesting one. It's a photorealistic model that WAS trained on porn. It exists as a halfway point. Not quite as hardcore as Pony can get but way more \"knowledgeable\" than Qwen or Z-Image Turbo. Its main drawback is sketchy anatomy compared to the others. It CAN do amazing things, but you'll ALSO get a lot of deformities. A lot of almost perfect pics ruined by that deformed foot or extra hand etc. And then BAM... exactly what you were going for.\n\nFor anime smut, you'll have to ask someone else :)",

In fact increasing the steps decreases the likeness of the person.\n\nIt's best if your input image is high resolution (higher than 1024x1024) and it's also good if your output resolution is high too. At first I was trying with 1024x1024 and was getting some good results and some bad. I upped my output resolution to 1440x1440 or 1920x1080 and found the likeness was matching a LOT more often.\n\nIt's possible that a Q5 quant is degrading the likeness but I don't know that. Also, the Q5 quants you linked to are of version 9, so quite a bit older than the latest v22.\n\nI can say that v20 works very well and some have said that v18 maintains likeness the best.\n\nI was able to find Q5 quants of the newer versions for you. Try one of these, and good luck...\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Arunk25/Qwen-Image-Edit-Rapid-AIO-GGUF/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/Arunk25/Qwen-Image-Edit-Rapid-AIO-GGUF/tree/main)",

Since each model excels at something unique, you should start with the model that gives you the pose/camera you want, then send the image to the next ksampler/advanced ksampler to give you color/lighting, and hook the depth map of the first image into it so it keeps the same shape, then send that image with its depth map to the next ksampler which can provide the texture/details (I like Z-image for this step).\n\nThat's just an example, you can invent any pipline you want with each step adding something the previous model couldn't.",

I’ve been lurking and learning here for a while, and I honestly couldn't have pulled this off without the incredible nodes, workflows, and troubleshooting tips shared by everyone here.\n\nI recently had the chance to integrate ComfyUI into a \"real-world\" professional production for **La Centrale** (a major French automotive marketplace), working alongside agencies BETC and Bloom.\n\n**The challenge:** We had to bring a saga of 25 custom-designed cars to life for over 10 different commercials in a very tight 4-week window.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qhuqwr/video/vhhgg7rajgeg1/player\n\n**The process:** To meet the brand's high standards, I deployed a hybrid pipeline: **3D for the structure/consistency and ComfyUI for the design, textures, and realism.** This allowed us to stay incredibly agile while maintaining a level of detail that traditional 3D alone wouldn't have reached in that timeframe.\n\nIt’s definitely not \"perfect,\" and there’s always room for improvement, but it’s a solid proof of concept that our workflows are ready for high-stakes professional advertising.\n\nThanks again for being such an inspiring hub of innovation. This is only the beginning! 🍿💥\n\n*(If anyone is curious about the specific nodes or how I handled the 3D-to-AI pass to keep the cars consistent, I’m happy to answer questions in the comments!)*\n\nmore details about this project : [https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai](https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai)  \n",

The team found that we could transform camera input (selfie) into a depth map rendered in real time, and then send this depth map to a 3D mesh or something else. It gave us some cool effects, and we figured out how to approximately calculate the distance between the camera and the user’s face = we got new face lenses.  \nSo that’s how I got the idea of using a depth map.  \n  \nAnd obviously I also saw some youtubers using it as an input, but they usually used a couple more maps as well (outlines, color masks, etc)",

Unfortunately that seems to break some of the functionality. After grouping/ungrouping until it works my workflow is barely cleaned up. I thought I could use different string inputs with text concatenate to help manage the text input a bit more (LoRA tokens in one, character attributes in another, etc) but once merged the concatenate links broke. Merging my model inputs broke other links if there were any links that weren't perfectly linear. I was trying to get a simplified \"variables\" \"constants\" \"output\" workflow, but it never really worked as intended.\n\nAlso the group boxes are pointless because whenever I'm clicking around to move the canvas I invariably end up accidentally dragging a group of nodes. The groups can't be pinned like the nodes, so the group boxes are kinda pointless. Everyone uses them in their custom workflows though. I have taken to just deleting all the groups, rearranging in a way that makes sense to me, and then pinning the nodes so I can't accidentally drag them around.",

It's a little more convoluted now, because they removed the button from the quick menu. But, you can either right click the group and bring up the context menu or you can toggle the properties panel using the icon on the top right, then click the settings tab.\n\nThe problem I have is that a group can be pinned but it's nodes aren't. So I can select all of the group nodes and the group, but the nodes move and the group doesn't. It's a minor inconvenience, I have to undo the last change, unpin the group and then make sure it's all selected.",

How often do you use a workflow out of the box, with no alterations? I find they never 100% suit my needs, whether they're default or made by someone else. (The point being, I don't think you'll ever be satisfied to the point that you have to do nothing.)\n\nI think you're right about developers and designers constantly moving goal posts and creating shifts where the users didn't necessarily demand changes. But, there really are considerations beyond just what you want as an individual. Hopefully they can be more open in advance about changes and willing to make compromises and adjustments to what they're doing. But that's not a one way street, it means you have to be open too.",

          "text": ">If you pass it through six times you get a slight fading effect, that is all\n\nNo, that is not all. The VAE will degrade the details of the image. Below is a bunch of comparisons between input image and 8x trips through a VAE encode/decode cycle (scroll to zoom in):\n\n[Here is a robot](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY3).\n\n[Here is an anime creature.](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY4)\n\n[Here is a random demon woman](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcy).\n\n[Here is a Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcx).\n\n[Here is a lower resolution Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njgy).\n\nYour methodology isn't great because you are running a single 1080 x 1935 image through the VAE so the loss of detail is much less noticeable. When you run a 1 megapixel image through the same process (like you would with image editing, for example) the degradation is much more apparent. Even if the the colors remain basically the same, the destruction of details is too much to be dismissed as a \"slight fading effect\". \n\n---\n\n>It's some sort of groupthink, when no-one actually tested it.\n\nOkay, let's test it. I'll create an image from two inputs, and run 8 edits on consecutive outputs. \n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dJvcwHqW/grid-00027.png) I make all edits directly with latents, so it was only one encode/decode cycle. 0 Degradation.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/R472s7cq/grid-00028.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle, changing the seed each prompt. Nothing super noticeable, if at all. There might be if I had static elements that are supposed to remain untouched by the model. Test that next.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dwYxyhz0/grid-00029.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle and keep the seed static. There are tons of errors, and they compound from one gen to the next. The wings and midsection are the most noticeable, but there are errors all over the place. So, I can confidently say leaving the seed static from gen to gen will fuck up your image. Now lets test that VAE cycle.\n\n---\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/rcC97QPW/vae-00001.png) is a run of edits using the VAE.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/tytz82M6/vaeless-00001.png) is a run of edits using only latents.\n\nBoth of these runs are the exact same seed, exact same prompts. The differences are subtle, but the result is clear. [Here is the final output](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NzAw). \n\nCompare the detail on the house and the tree above it on the mug. Every edit had a clear instruction: \"Leave the coffee mug exactly as it is.\" And it did, but the VAE got in the way and degraded the details.\n\nSo yeah, it was some sort of \"groupthink\", but the group was thinking based on knowledge gained over years of doing this. The color degradation was likely based on an unchanging seed, but passing into and out of latent space will still fuck up your image so it's best to avoid it as much as possible. \n\nEven a VAE as good as the Flux2 Vae will fuck up your image with enough cycles, because the tiny mistakes compound with each other. If I ran that mug through ten more edits the results would be even more stark. That's also why you mask when you inpaint, otherwise your final result ends up like mud.",

My reading of that made it seem like you did indeed say there wasn't a quality/detail loss, which is what I was countering. My bad.

Rounding errors are common, but they do not cause image saturation like in these examples.\n\nSure, I didn’t test this with Flux 2, but it looks like the Flux model tends to add a bit more saturation to the input image on each pass. My suspicion is that Flux has a built-in corrector that works “well” on the first pass but then accumulates over subsequent passes. The problem is that it seems to be applied only to unchanged areas, so ideally your correction pass should also target only those areas.\n\nHave you tried whether the same behavior happens with img2img without inpainting? Did you keep the same seed on each pass, or did you change it? In any case, it’s usually best to do your generation first, then crop and stitch the original background back into the image using the same mask, and only then proceed with the next pass.",
