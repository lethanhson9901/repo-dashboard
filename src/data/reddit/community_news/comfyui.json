If so then very good.\n\nAt the worst people can just create FP8/FP16 from the NVFP4 models for other hardware that doesn't support NVFP4.\n\nBut I do see an argument coming that because gamers don't need huge VRAM and Nvidia are offering NVFP4, nor do AI users, so hey the new 6000 Pro type cards only come with 64GB VRAM haha. 6090 24GB!",

INT4 loses too much precision and looks garbage for image gen, which is why alternatives like SVDQuant and NVFP4 exist.  SVDQuant and NVFP4 are two different approaches to achieving the same goal, preserving as much 16-bit precision as possible in a 4-bit base format.  The main benefit as I understand it of NVFP4 is the native acceleration on Blackwell, otherwise SVDQuant probably preserves more of the outliers in 16-bit than NVFP4 does and most seem to think it looks a little better.  That said I'm personally pretty impressed with the fidelity and performance of NVFP4 on my 5090 and will probably use that for refining my prompts and only switch to full precision for the final renders (if I feel it's actually necessary).  More info that you asked for but thought it might help others too.  Hopefully I didn't mangle anything in this description :)",

I just, nvidia is so scummy and I'm tired of making really cool breakthroughs and they try and phrase it to milk as much money possible out of everyone by essentially phrasing it as \"buy the 50 series so you can get this benefit\", only to have them later on go \"oh haha now everyone can use it!\", instead of just doing that in the first place.\n\nI get that doesn't generate revenue but if people have already supported the company then jesus christ, they've paid the premium for the update.",

              "text": "Good question. In theory yes, in practice not really (yet).\nIn WAN 2.2 + SVI Pro the anchor latent is treated as a static reference, not a generic or evolving latent. If you reuse a latent from a previous step (or a whole video) as anchor, you usually get normalization issues, color drift or flicker. That’s why anchors are still expected to be a single still image, shared across all segments. What works better is keeping the anchor fixed and letting continuity happen via conditioning, seeds and motion injection, not by changing the anchor itself.\nI’m testing latent-to-latent anchoring, but without proper re-normalization it tends to be worse than the original setup.\nSo yeah — cool idea, just not stable enough yet in the current WAN pipeline.",

I had a case where the stick figure resulting from dwpose preprocessor crossed in the wrong order, with the blue stick crossing over the green stick, rather than the other way round. I just copied the image  from the preview image, painted the crossing green, and used the resulting image as the input for pose, skipping the whole preprocessor this time.\n2. If the dwpose is correct, but flux 2 klein is still not creating the correct pose, support it with a descriptive text prompt. The text prompt I used for the example image was: \"Change the pose of the subject in image2 to the pose in image1. A medium shot of the woman from knees up, leaning against the door frame. The woman is looking to the side, reading a book. Her left arm is hanging down, holding a wine glass. Her right hand is holding a book. Her left leg is lifted at an angle. Her weight rests on her right leg, which is partly obscured by the left leg.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fnxu205dxdg1.png?width=3409&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e20dd8fe5c4185baf1e22c3f38d91d1ac031ff",

I'd have to pause the video and create it manually, but I might make a mistake at some point. Please! 🙏\n\nI have a question about rendering. I installed Trellis and tested it a bit; it might not be perfect in Comfyui compared to the web API. Do you think the image will fix any issues that might arise if the rendering isn't perfect?",
