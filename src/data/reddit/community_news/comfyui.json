Enjoy creating your masterpieces!\n\ns+ drag to size brush\n\no+ drag to opacity\n\nspace to hide ui.\n\ndraw\n\nofc is not krita (its a file with 476 KB in size) , is just a easy and fun tool",

I've seen some solutions to this in the past but there have always been some sort of limiting factor with them. Sadly--and predictably--Adobe is pushing their own crap AI features that don't allow the customization (i.e. LoRAs) that all digital artists need for integrating gen AI into their production processes.\n\nI'm constantly going back and forth between Photoshop and ComfyUI. There are several advanced features that I use in Photoshop such as smart adjustment layers. But mostly it is general basic editing.\n\nIf this node can take root in the community, I think it should be continually expanded with features. Like I said, it doesn't need to have everything that Photoshop does. The tools should focus on how work is done in ComfyUI.\n\nI'll try out these custom nodes as soon as I can.",

          "text": "This is absolutely something that comfyui needs, and has needed for some time. I applaud your efforts. I think it can be useful for the average non-artist user. There are some really good ideas here with layers, color wheel, brushes, etc. I also like that it immediately goes into a \"full\" mode as soon as you click on it so you can start drawing. I also like that you can move the floating windows, although users should be warned that the layers palette might be hidden; mine was behind the color wheel when I started it up.\n\nThat said, as an artist myself, the pressure sensitivity is poor.

There are some really good ideas here with layers, color wheel, brushes, etc. I also like that it immediately goes into a \"full\" mode as soon as you click on it so you can start drawing. I also like that you can move the floating windows, although users should be warned that the layers palette might be hidden; mine was behind the color wheel when I started it up.\n\nThat said, as an artist myself, the pressure sensitivity is poor.

Just keep in mind that sometimes there's compatibility issues where even though an app can export to a format, you might not get the same results in the native app. Just something to consider if/when you decide to do that, but don't let it deter you.\n\n  \nRE: Brushes...you absolutely want to look into better pressure sensitivity if you're going to play w/brushes, because that's going to determine how they perform. Definitely look into it; pressure sensitivity's been around for a long time, so I'm sure it's a very common science by now.\n\nI'd recommend asking Claude to help you implement code that can A) take full advantage of the levels of pressure sensitivity of tablet pens, and B) enable stabilization. If you can get those two working, more than half the work is already done.\n\nI say go for it! There are very basic apps that can take advantage of pressure sensitivity, so I'm sure it's doable.\n\nGood luck!",

Changing the style or background of the person in Image 1 is not appropriate, so do not do that. The new pose should be pixel-accurate to the pose we are copying. The positions of the arms, head, and legs should match the pose we want to copy. Change the view and angle to exactly match Image 2. The head tilt and eye direction should also match the person in Image 2.\n\nworkflow: [https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230](https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230)\n\nAuthor link:  \n[Drawing node for ComfyUI (ComfySketch)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1qvo6m7/drawing_node_for_comfyui_comfysketch/)  \nby[u/Vivid-Loss9868](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vivid-Loss9868/) in[comfyui](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/)",

UI had some issues when loading Loras (post training). \n\nI only tried 1 training loop using 45 reference Trance tracks with default settings. Training loss is very high imo and the Lora came out of it was bad. Even a 4090 takes a very long time to generate a decent dataset let alone the training part. More than I'm willing to spend time on. \n\nI am a music producer and this model, even with Loras, doesn't even come close to what Suno can do. Otherwise, fun weekend project for those who have the time to mess with.",

For instance, going to FA2 would greatly speed this process up, but it is only used for inference I think.

Much better instrumentally than with version 1.0, and a lot better with lyric accuracy.  One word it struggled with was \"destiny\" which came out as Denny in two versions.  A second one it had trouble was with \"Mozzarella\"\n\nI tried to vary the vocalist description, and it didn't change much of the voice.\n\nGeneral: Least accurately Lyrically  \nPower Metal, Powerful male vocalist, soaring high pitched vocals, operatic vocalist, lyrics sung story style, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,  rapid double base drumming\n\nA Sabaton like sound: This one sounded a bit less like synth guitars, most accurate with lyrics, got Mozzarella right, only messed up Destiny.  \nPower Metal, male vocalist, powerful baritone voice, lyrics sung story style, clear diction, steady military style marches set to metal, big bold hooks, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, galloping rythm, tight precussive riffs with a battlefield feel, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,\n\nStatovarios sound: Worst with lyrics, also did a bit reordering, and repeating and least less poppy voice.  \nPower Metal, Powerful male vocalist, soaring vocals, classical-inspired guitar solos, lyrics, anthemic, technical precision, dramatic delivery, heavy rhythmic guitars, keyboards and orchestral elements adding grandeur,  rapid double base drumming\n\nThere is some bug with it, since the first generation went very quickly, but the second one took a lot in TextEncodeAceStepAudio1.5 about 2x as long and gave the following error in VAE Decode\n\n0 models unloaded.  \nWarning: Ran out of memory when regular VAE decoding, retrying with tiled VAE decoding.\n\nSo I just killed it, and reran after waiting 8 minutes.\n\nSecond time I tried clearing cache and release models before running, This time TextEcode worked good but VAE Decpde gave the same error.  It might be because I tried 6 minutes, but first run only used 20GB of my 4090's vram.\n\nRerun I also got a lot of regardless of how it ran:  \nFlash Attention failed, using default SDPA: Mask must not be set for Flash attention\n\nWarning: Ran out of memory when regular VAE decoding, retrying with tiled VAE decoding.

This experience has only been so satisfying thanks to everyone sharing their knowledge and Workflows here on Reddit and in Discord groups.\n\nWith that in mind, and wanting to create a backup environment for my workflows, I created a repository on GitHub and included all my work so far (I plan to keep updating it).\n\nI wanted to thank this wonderful community and everyone for their contributions. I hope that, at least, these workflows will help someone along the way.\n\nI had a very promising journey a few years ago at Civitai, creating LoRAs of Flux (before the big explosion of censorship and some other topics). I'm thinking about creating a similar repository on Git, sharing techniques for datasets, prompt captures, and training configurations; I'm still figuring out how to do it.\n\nAnyways, see you down the line on this almost endless road of learning and tinkering.  \nCheers!\n\n[https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows](https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows)",

Real-world physics, materials, and lighting. Shot as if captured by a high-resolution IMAX aerial documentary camera with dramatic slow-motion stop-motion animation style, ultra-detailed frame-by-frame geological textures and stone erosion visible in motion. No stylization, no painterly effects, no fantasy glow. Dynamic god's-eye aerial tracking shot starting with ultra-wide establishing shot of infinite tan desert continent devoid of vegetation, camera slowly dollies forward and zooms in progressively from 100mm wide lens to tight 400mm telephoto close-up on one colossal jet-black basalt cathedral megacity carved into sheer cliff face. Precise camera path: begin high overhead aerial orbit revealing endless serpentine basalt mountain ranges and scattered satellite fortress towns, then smooth forward tracking descent following elevated black stone causeway toward target megacity, gradually narrowing focus while maintaining background depth showing another freestanding jet-black cathedral complex rising from desert flats 5km distant with maze-like defensive walls snaking across foreground flats. Final tight zoom reveals intricate Gothic lancet windows, flying buttresses, weathered basalt blocks with micro-cracks, soot stains, and mineral streaks on the cliff-carved spires and terraces, shadows cast sharp geometric patterns across eroded stone surfaces. No sky visible, no clouds, no fog, no haze, no horizon. Terrain slopes downward foreground, rises infinitely distant forming continuous landmass. Desert surface: compacted sand, cracked clay flats, wind-eroded sediment layers, exposed bedrock, gravel fields, erosion channels, mineral staining, micro-fractures, dust accumulation at true scale showing granular physics in stop-motion frames. Jet-black basalt architecture dominates: chipped edges, uneven blocks, rough grain, soot, water marks, matte-semi-gloss variations. Continuous mountain chains with layered escarpments, jagged ridgelines, sheer cliffs, columnar formations, ravines. Megacity details: vertical terraces, stair systems, deep chambers embedded in rock, surrounded by labyrinthine black stone walls with choke points, dead ends, enclosed courtyards. Satellite towns: compact fortress-cathedrals with squat towers, crenellations, narrow streets. Elevated walkways, arched bridges, aqueducts linking structures. Jet-black rivers, blackwater swamps with eroded banks. Harsh directional sunlight, high contrast hard shadows, deep occlusion shadows, intense surface definition. National Geographic IMAX documentary footage style, extreme micro-detail clarity at all scales, perfect resolution, real cities real stone real erosion, monumental oppressive infinite worldscape captured in slow deliberate stop-motion aerial zoom revealing construction scale and geological majesty.\n\nThen made the original image in Klein 9b -> i2i with ZIT and a depth controlnet -> upscale with Seedvr2 -> then Klein 9b - make this image photorealistic",

So there were times when base was nudging along in right direction but then turbo goes completely different way making minor but breaking changes. Based on that I would assume to use LoRa on turbo.\n\nBut it actually depends on your hand off point, kinda like wan. It also depends on how base and turbo react to same LoRa. I did a quick test. Prompt:\n\n    Lain fron anime Serial experiments of Lain sitting on the floor in the center of completely dark room . Different wires and corrugated pipes containing high speed cables snake across the floor connecting stacks of crt monitors around her. The pixelated screens glow a soft grey blue and illuminate the scene. Retro anime style.\n\nFunnily it didnt know her so this makes a good exhibition of my point. Now if I let base do the heavy lifting like in first pair of images, you can see turbo just converges and cleans it up. Its roughly .7 base and rest turbo. Whatever base makes, turbo \"refines\". In second pair, I went opposite, letting base do about .2 and turbo the rest. This gives the most changes, keeps base as composition but takes good liberties.\n\nI suppose you probably get it now why I said LoRa on turbo makes more sense. You let slow base make the framework in smaller part of the cycle and then let faster turbo converge quickly. This could be opposite if base has some exceptional benefit in using LoRa on it, but I doubt it.\n\nIdeally you have to find the proper pass on point between the models. Also if same LoRa works on both models, why not both with different strengths, again based on transition.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8k9kxm5ggihg1.jpeg?width=2250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9877819a55c69102fd7fda997bc3818312d05064\n\nEdit: Test with no LoRa, cause I haven't made or found one I want to use yet.",

I am still a suno subscriber, but have been for 1 year and I will show you my profile on there if anyone is curious about what I prompt in AI music. I will say that with my full chest it's easily 4.5 - v5 quality I am hearing here. This is amazing.\n\nI really am curious how well this will work if I train a Lora now.\n\nEdit: https://youtu.be/y-IXg-nkNQ0 quick post to my music YT channel for those here.
