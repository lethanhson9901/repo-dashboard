          "text": "Alright, let me preface by saying I admire the patience, effort and time that went into this.\n\nNow this might hurt to read, but it's just okay for AI standards, and awful for actual film-making standards. There's almost no cohesion between cuts, and some editorial work is needed to make things flow together properly.\n\nYou need to research some film-making, framing, composition and such. Stuff like the dude shooting forwards, then upwards look like unrelated actions, they don't flow together, there's no need to use the entire clip every time, cut it and disperse 1-2 second of him shooting and the machine reacting.\n\nThe car scene with the shotgun and the drone blowing up look completely unrelated, you should've brought that clip in an editing software and start the cut with the drone blowing up. Right now it looks like the dude shoots in the wrong direction, and the drone blows up by itself a few seconds later, there should also be a shot of the drone approaching from afar, it feels like it just spawns behind the car like a videogame.\n\nDo not randomly use cross-dissolves or fades to black, those type of transitions have meaning, their purpose is to distance cuts, creating the feeling of time passing or location changes, not blending cuts together, actual cuts work better for that.\n\nUse LoRAs for actions the AI doesn't know how to work with, the dude putting his entire mouth around the neck of the bottle looks really weird.\n\nLastly, everything looks like it's in slow motion, use an editing software to accelerate the movement if needed.\n\nI know it may seem harsh and it's unpleasant to read this, but if I just say that it's good when it isn't, you aren't gonna get any better.",

I’m slowly building up to a full build. I have tried wan 2.2 and it’s impressive. I see commenters who are giving it harsh criticism and it’s well deserved, but I also think is better than what amateurs can do atm. I’m hoping this makes its way to skilled storytellers and someone can step up and give us a proper film made with ai.  But thanks for sharing. It’s very motivating for me to look forward to using these tools and also learn how to tell good stories with these tools. Keep going and keep sharing take the constructive criticism you get and make some adjustments along the way.",

We want to let you know early to set clear expectations, maintain transparency, and make sure the transition is smooth for users and contributors alike.\n\n# What does this mean for you?\n\n* **Redirects:** No need to worry, **GitHub will automatically redirect all existing links, stars, and forks to the new location**.\n* **Action Recommended:** While redirects are in place, we recommend updating your local git remotes to point to the new URL: [`https://github.com/comfy-org/ComfyUI.git`](https://github.com/comfy-org/ComfyUI.git)\n   * Command:\n      * `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI.git`\n   * You can do this already as we already set up the current mirror repo in the proper location.\n* **Continuity:** This is an organizational change to help us manage the project more effectively.\n\n# Why we’re making this change?\n\nAs ComfyUI has grown from a personal project into a cornerstone of the generative AI ecosystem, we want to ensure the infrastructure behind it is as robust. Moving to **Comfy Org** allows us to:\n\n* **Improve Collaboration:** An organization account allows us to manage permissions for our growing core team and community contributors more effectively. This will allow us to transfer individual issues between different repos\n* **Better Security:** The organization structure gives us access to better security tools, fine-grained access control, and improved project management features to keep the repo healthy and secure.\n* **AI and Tooling:** Makes it easier for us to integrate internal automation, CI/CD, and AI-assisted tooling to improve testing, releases, and contributor change review over time.\n\n# Does this mean it’s easier to be a contributor for ComfyUI?\n\nIn a way, yes. For the longest time, the repo only had a single person (comfyanonymous) to review and guarantee code quality. While this list of people is still small now as we bring more people onto the project, we are going to do better overtime to accept more community input to the codebase itself and **eventually setup longterm open governance structure for the ownership of the project**.\n\n\n\nOur commitment to open source remains the same, this change will push us to further enable even more community collaboration, faster iteration, and a healthier PR and review process as the project continues to scale.\n\n\n\nThank you for being part of this journey!",

          "text": "Thanks for sharing this. As you requested, I cleaned up the workflow. I added another upscale method (QWEN Edit 2511) which I think better than SeedVR. SeedVR is still there just bypassed. The workflow is horizontal rather than cramped over each other. It is divided into sections as per the developer (QWEN, SDXL, Detailers, zimage, controlnet, upscale by QIE 2511 and then optional upscale by seedvr. I did not alter settings or lines wiring. This is the original workflow just untangled so you know how it flows by looking at it. I did not run it after cleaning it, because I don't have the models and some nodes are missing (tagger and seedvr2) and since I don't have use for this concept, I didn't feel like downloading everything. Again, the workflow should work as if it was the original. I didn't alter or change anything in the original workflow.

The CLIP model has a special encoded model. You must have it in your CLIP file. You don’t load it in the workflow, it just makes the clip model work correctly. If you don’t the clip model won’t properly load and have error codes. \n\nAlso this models has a lighting Lora built in. So do NOT use lighting Lora’s. This will cause the image to be garbage. Also it is sensitive to some Lora’s, this will cause the images be blurry or not fully focused. So you need to test Lora’s.",

🚀\n\n**PSA: this training method guaranteed to maintain all the styles that come with the model, for example :y*****ou can literally have your character in in the style of sponge bob show chilling at the crusty crab with sponge bob and have sponge bob intact alongside of your character who will transform to the style of the show!!*** **just thought to throw this out there.. and no this will not break a 6b parameter model and I'm talking at strength 1.00 lora as well. remember guys you have the ability to change the strength of your lora as well. Cheers!!**\n\n**🚨 IMPORTANT UPDATE ⚡ Why Simple Captioning Is Essential**\n\nI’ve seen some users struggling with distorted features or “mushy” results. If your character isn’t coming out clean, you are likely over-captioning your dataset.\n\nz-image handles training differently than what you might be used to with SDXL or other models.\n\n**🧼 The “Clean Label” Method**\n\nMy method relies on a minimalist caption.\n\nIf I am training a character who is a man, my caption is simply:\n\nman\n\n**🧠 Why This Works (The Science) • The Sigmoid Factor**\n\nThis training process utilizes a Sigmoid schedule with a high initial noise floor. This noise does not “settle” well when you try to cram long, descriptive prompts into the dataset.\n\n**• Avoiding Semantic Noise**\n\nHeavy captions introduce unnecessary noise into the training tokens. When the model tries to resolve that high initial noise against a wall of text, it often leads to:\n\nDisfigured faces\n\nLoss of fine detail\n\n**• Leveraging Latent Knowledge**\n\nYou aren’t teaching the model what clothes or backgrounds are, it already knows. By keeping the caption to a single word, you focus 100% of the training energy on aligning your subject’s unique features with the model’s existing 6B-parameter intelligence.\n\n**• Style Versatility**\n\nThis is how you keep the model flexible.\n\nBecause you haven’t “baked” specific descriptions into the character, you can drop them into any style, even a cartoon. and the model will adapt the character perfectly without breaking.\n\n[original post with discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1ppy4t0/my_final_zimageturbo_lora_training_setup_full/) \\-*deleted but discussion still there*, **this is the same exact post btw just with adding few things and not removing anything from previous one**\n\n***Additionally, here is full fp32 model merge:***\n\n***Full fp32 model here :*** [***https://civitai.com/models/2266472?modelVersionId=2551132***](https://civitai.com/models/2266472?modelVersionId=2551132)\n\n**Credit for:**\n\n[**Tongyi-MAI For the ABSOLUTE UNIT OF A MODEL**](https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI)\n\n[**Ostris And his Absolute legend of A training tool and Adapter**](https://github.com/ostris)\n\n[**ClownsharkBatwing For the amazing RES4LYFE SAMPLERS**](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing)\n\n[**erosDiffusion For Revealing Flowmatch Scheduler**](https://github.com/erosDiffusion)",

But if you prefer 1024 you can absolutely do that it’s just going to be slower during training. But I would be more than glad if you dm me and discuss this further as there could be a different underlying problem. Bc during training I noticed that z-image interpret some words entirely differently, i tested that with the model without LoRA’s to check which words are interpreted differently and there was a big chunk of at least what I tested, reason I’m saying this is if the model interpreted a word differently it could potentially have initial noise of wrong colors or parts and that would go into your training which is bad thing. And since we are using Sigmoid Timestep that’s a quick initial high noise basically which could cause a blend of chaos if we choose the wrong words as a caption.",

Now the second part which is using your lora inside of comfyui at its full capacity, what I did for that was merging these 3 shards using the repo I mentioned to have the actual full fp32 weights since the model we previously used inside of comfyui and most famous one that we downloaded was bf16 model, meaning earlier before having the fp32 model we trained on fp32 since AiToolKit was capable of doing that but used bf16 inside of comfyui because we did not have the fp32, which is okay for most people and even me, but since I wanted the full potential of the LoRA and the [missing unet weights] was bugging me I wanted to run it on what I actually trained the LoRA on which is FP32.",

Let me know if I say something that's wrong, please:  \n \\- Templates load the whole graph, they don't load on top of the workspace you have opened.  \n \\- So the only way to use templates like how I am proposing SugarCubes is to copy the workflow segment you have saved as a template and paste it into the workflow you're actually working on  \n \\- Comfy DOES have a built in feature called \"Template Packs\" but there is no way to create them in modern ComfyUI. Template Packs actually can be loaded in on top of workflows rather than opening a new one, and this is very similar to if not the same path that copy/paste uses\n\nUltimately I want a more organized and sharable way to create these kinds of workflow segments. Saving your segments in separate template files is clever, but it's not a full solution like Cubes will be, at least not for the problem I have.\n\nI should note, subgraphs are very very close to what I want. My main problem with subgraphs is really just the way the abstraction was implemented. Subgraphs can be \"published\" which saves them for later and makes them nodes in the node lookup. That's great!\n\nBut I find myself using them primarily for smaller workflow sections rather than larger steps in the workflow because a subgraph can make things harder to reason about when used for larger sections - at least for me. Seeing one node with a big stack of inputs is unwieldy, though it's excellent that we can zoom into subgraphs when we need to reason about those sections more deeply.\n\nSubgraphs often have many inputs and outputs just like a normal node. Cubes are best when they only have one input and one output. It involves a more compartmentalized style of graph building. There is nothing stopping you from doing it with subgraphs, though!",

Let me know if I say something that's wrong, please:*  \n*- Templates load the whole graph, they don't load on top of the workspace you have opened.*\n\nThat's not the way they work. They only load what you saved in the template and and can be added to any workflow. There is no copy/pasting involved.\n\nThe workflow in the image:\n\nEvery group is a template that I have saved and I just added them in. No, I wouldn't use all of this like this, but, I could. It flows. If there is a group in there that I decide that I don't want to use, I can bypass or delete it.\n\nSearge: I enter a prompt and it enhances it and then sends it to the Prompt from filesx3 node.\n\nPrompt From Filesx3: It lets you load up to 3 simple text files that contain prompts. It works similar to wildcards. The 2 text boxes: the top one is added to the beginning of the prompt, the 2nd one is added to the end. Both are optional. This contains clip text encode nodes which get their clip model from the SDXL subgraph.\n\nControlnet: the created prompt is sent to the Controlnet which processes it and sends it through the heart of the workflow, the SDXL subgraph.\n\nFaceID: it uses the model from the SDXL subgraph, processes it, and then sends it back to be sent through the SDXL subgraph to the ksampler.\n\nThe output of the XL subgraph is sent through an outpaint subgraph(a full outpaint workflow that only needs input and output image nodes) and is outpainted. I could easily make the outpaint node use the same model that is in the XL subgraph. The output of that is sent to the Wan 1st/last subgraph(a full wan workflow that just needs image inputs) and is used as the 1st image. The loose load image node is for the final image for the wan subgraph.\n\nI started this with the SDXL subgraph group and dropped all of the other templates in. No copy/pasting, I just opened the template menu and selected the one that I wanted and clicked on it. The SDXL subgraph is a full workflow that can work with only an output image node connected to it. The other connections do not have to be connected. The switches control the inputs. The ouput connections are just there so it can be used for other things like I did here.\n\nI only show items on the faces of the subgraphs that I may want to change. Everything else is hidden inside.\n\nI'm not saying what you are doing is bad, I'm just showing an alternative that is built in to Comfy. :)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d47bvzln3vag1.png?width=3695&format=png&auto=webp&s=03ec1c2e2b822409c9311b505ea97c43bcdf0c91",

          "text": "More like this, please! Learning and using ComfyUI gives me the exact same vibes as learning Ableton Live (a DAW) in the early 2000’s. Tons of tutorials and workflows, most of which are overwhelming and at odds with each other on node and layout preferences, and so many customizations and downloads that cause conflicts - and then you find something that works and just lean all the way into it lol. Any apps/plugins/extensions that can assist with analyzing and diagnosing the workflow is appreciated. \n\nWhat would be awesome is if there was an app that examined your full startup log (which inevitably displays countless little errors or extra load times after extended use and tons of custom nodes have been installed) and provided remediation steps to speed up the local server loading process.\n\nEven better - imagine if you dragged a workflow *into an app* that analyzed *every* component — not just nodes, but models, LoRAs, etc. — and automatically found, downloaded, *and placed* everything where it should go. Such that any workflow you see is guaranteed to work without you having to *make* it work. \n\nAs long as we’re daydreaming, add a toggle to “optimize workflow for your system” where total size of the workflow will never exceed your VRAM threshold and trigger offloading (meaning the app would swap out a workflow’s model variant for a GGUF that is best for your system, for example).\n\nIf such an app existed, I would happily drop cash for it, and I’m sure I’m not the only one!\n\nAnyway, thanks for your work on this 👍🏻",

My advice, which isn’t exclusive to NSFW, is to download one or two of the most popular workflows (I personally started out using UmeiArt because his workflows cover just about every discipline, not to mention they don’t require a ton of unnecessary custom nodes to run). Play around with them until you’re comfortable with what every node does in the workflow, then experiment. Pretty soon you’ll be building your own custom workflows that are tailored to what you want.\n\nOh, and when in doubt, consult with Google AI.

The Wan workflow I use now has simplified a lot since I started, as I've moved all my effort into good images, then upscale them, then Wan to animate. So Flux, Chroma and ZIT/Qwen for the images. ZIT will give you pretty instant results although take time to fully understand Comfy over time it really pays off. Problem is now there is SO much coming out, models loras, workflows etc. \nCode Crafters Corner YT I found useful, straightforward.

Everyone must find their own way, so you'll never get a final answer other than \"learn by doing.\" It's time consuming.\n\nWith that said, the brightest lamp posts on my journey so far have been as follows: \n\n-pixaroma comfy UI tutorial series. Start with ep. 1 and watch the first few to get up and running, then you can jump around to whichever topic is most relevant once you have the basics.\n\n-use the comfy UI \"templates\" to get started. Any workflow that's embedded in a civitai image or video will almost certainly not be beginner friendly.\n\n-images first, then video. Images are way easier and faster to get up and running. Idk why but I struggled to get my first video gen for days. Just couldn't figure it out, until I went back and tried the built in template.\n\n-chatGPT \n\n-browse civitai to find what you like, then look at the information on the right to see what models of other settings they used. \n\nNote: you asked about NSFW, but it's all the same. Pretty much all of them will do \"softcore\" images and videos out of the gate, especially without nudity, so you don't really need an NSFW model to get up and running. In fact it's probably better to get familiar with the base models capabilities beforehand. The base models are generally very well done and more beginner friendly.  The NSFW specific stuff is usually more focused, which in turn makes them harder to use, and if they're poorly trained they can degrade the output, as well.\n\nMy starting point was a simple Qwen text-to-image template built into comfy UI. It can do topless ladies out of the box. Easy peasy.",

      "text": "# tl;dr\n\n1. Use the popular `uv` tool to quickly recreate python environments\n2. Use the official `comfy-cli` to quickly restore node dependencies\n3. Install ComfyUI on a separat Linux system for maximum compatibility (`triton`, `sage-attention`)\n\n# Why?\n\nSo many times in this forum I read about:\n\n* my ComfyUI installation got bricked\n* a custom node broke ComfyUI\n* ComfyUI Portable doesn't work anymore after an update\n* ComfyUI Desktop doesn't start after the update\n* Use this freak tool to check what's wrong!\n* How to install triton on Windows?\n* Does sage-attention need a blood sacrifice to work?\n\nAll of these can be prevented or mitigated by learning and using these 3 common, popular and standardized tools:\n\n1. uv\n2. comfy-cli\n3. Linux\n\nThink about all the headaches and time lost by sticking to any other esoteric solutions. If you don't want to learn these few commands, then just bookmark this thread.\n\n# UV\n\nThe `uv` tool is a layer on top of python and pip. It makes handling environments easier and most importantly:\n\n**IT'S FASTER!!!**\n\nIf your ComfyUI installation got bricked, just purge the enviroment and start anew in 1 minute.\n\n[Installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation)\n\n# ComfyUI\n\n**Installation**\n\n    git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI\n    cd ComfyUI\n    uv venv\n    uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r manager_requirements.txt\n    uv pip install comfy-cli\n\n**Update**\n\n    git pull\n    uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r manager_requirements.txt\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    comfy node update all\n    comfy node restore-dependencies\n\n**Run**\n\n    uv run main.py\n\n**Purge**\n\nIf something happened, just purge the environment. With `uv` and `comfy-cli` it only takes 1min.\n\n    rm -fR .venv\n    uv venv\n    uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r manager_requirements.txt\n    uv pip install comfy-cli\n    source .venv/bin/activate\n    comfy node restore-dependencies\n\n**Downgrade**\n\nFind your tagged version here [https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/releases)\n\n    git checkout tags/v0.7.0\n    uv pip install -r requirements.txt -r manager_requirements.txt\n\nIf that didn't work -> purge.\n\n# Linux\n\nYou don't need Linux per se, but everything is more compatible, faster and easier to install, especially `triton` (for speedups!), `sage-attention` (for speedups!) and `deep-speed` (for speed-ups!). You don't even have to abandon Windows, everything is fine, just buy another harddisk (\\~30€, see it as an investment in your sanity!) and setup a dualboot, just for ComfyUI. Your Photoshop and games can stay on Windows (\\*cough\\* \\*cough\\* Steam Proton).\n\nBut which distribution? Here, use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com)! Don't ask any questions!\n\nInstall Python3: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3`\n\nInstall [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Debian&target_version=12&target_type=deb_local)\n\nGood times!\n\n# Questions & Answers\n\n**Q: Why doesn't** [**Comfy.org**](http://Comfy.org) **care more?**\n\nA: They do care, it's just that time and resources are limited. It started as a free, voluntary, open-source project. It's an organization now, but far from a multimillion dollar company. One of ComfyUI's unique selling propositions is: new models immediately. Everything else is secondary.\n\n**Q: Why does ComfyUI break in the first place?**\n\nA: ComfyUI relies heavily on high-performance instructions of your GPU, which need to have up-to-date drivers (*CUDA*), whichs need to be compatible with *PyTorch* (the programming library for computations), which needs to be compatible with your *Python* version (the programming language runtime), which needs to be compatible with your operating system. If any combination of `Python x Pytorch x CUDA x OS` isn't available or incompatible, it breaks. And of course any update and new features need to be bug free and compatible with every package installed in the environment. And all of this should ideally be tested, everytime, for every update, with every combination.. which simply doesn't happen. We are basically crossing fingers that in some edge case it doesn't call a function which isn't actually available. That's why you should stick to the [recommended versions](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI#manual-install-windows-linux).\n\n**Q: Why do custom nodes break ComfyUI?**\n\nA: Another one of ComfyUI's unique selling propositions is its' flexibility and extensibility. It achieves this by simply loading any code within `custom_nodes` and allowing them to install anything. Easy.. but fragile (and highly insecure!). If a custom node developer wasn't careful (\"Let's install a different Pillow version YOLO!\") it's bricked. Even if you uninstall the node, the different package version is already installed. There are only a few - weak - safeguards in place, like \"Prohibit installation of a different pytorch version\", \"Install named versions from registry (*latest*) instead of current code in repo (*nightly*)\" and \"Fingers crossed\".\n\n**Q: Why does ComfyUI Desktop and ComfyUI Portable break so many times?**\n\nA: I have never used them myself, but I guess they are treated as secondary citizens by [comfy.org](http://comfy.org) which means even less testing than the manual version. And they need to make smart assumptions about your environment, which are probably not that smart in practice.\n\n**Q: Why is triton and sage-attention so hard to install?**\n\nA: For fast iteration the developers mainly work on Linux, and neglect Windows. Another notable example is [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/issues/2427) developed by Microsoft, who have a long standing history of neglecting the Windows platform.",

They are funded by business activities, so their infrastructure is very very good.\n\nCivArchive mostly points at HuggingFace, but because the folks using HF are being sneaky, it's the only good way to find things people have archived there. They \\*will\\* notice eventually.\n\nIf HuggingFace goes after these files, it's going to get weird, since the only alternatives will become the old school file sharing sites like Mega, which are akward to use at best.\n\nCivitAI is the main site. An alternative is unlikely due to the high cost of storing and quickly transfering a large set of models and LoRA's.\n\nPeople have a poor understanding of the financial reasons why Civ is having to do the agressive moderation they are doing - these are largely determined by payment processing companies, and why there are unlikely to be alternatives under current conditions. A site like Civ has a large operating cost, and with very few options for collecting revenue, it's a difficult business proposition, under the best of circumstances.",
