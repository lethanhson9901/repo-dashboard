More Efficient Loading\n\nMany GGUF loaders are optimized for:  \n\\- streaming  \n\\- memory mapping  \n\\- reducing VRAM spikes\n\n3.

You can open the subgraph and choose a megapixel value, like 1mp or 2mp but it doesn't let you directly choose your output resolution. Anyone know why?

I also tested cartoonish images on white backgrounds and sometimes it removes important things, for example, a flower on a vase with a simple color background it should leave the flower AND the vase, but sometimes it removes the flower, other times the vase and so on)\n\nIn this case it shows a bit of what I mean. The grass is part of the whole image, but you can see that the grass was about to be removed but not fully.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8zc5pebsweg1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3224f777cc685d993369a07d1c765765ed3cccdc\n\nIn any case, it's a great option with some details.",

I'm still very new to ComfyUI (I usually just do 3D/Unity stuff), but I really wanted to port a personal tool I made into ComfyUI to streamline my workflow.\n\nI originally created this tool as a website to help me self-study cinematic shots, specifically to memorize what different camera angles, lighting setups (like Rembrandt or Volumetric), and focal lengths actually look like (link to the original tool : [https://yedp123.github.io/](https://yedp123.github.io/)).\n\n**What it does:** It replaces the standard CLIP Text Encode node but adds a visual interface. You can select:\n\n* Camera Angles (Dutch, Low, High, etc.)\n* Lighting Styles\n* Focal Lengths & Aperture\n* Film Stocks & Color Palettes\n\nIt updates the preview image in real-time when you hover over the different options so you can see a reference of what that term means before you generate. You can also edit the final prompt string if you want to add/remove things. It outputs the string + conditioning for Stable Diffusion, Flux, Nanobanana or Midjourney.\n\nLike I mentioned above, I just started playing with ComfyUI so I am not sure if this can be of any help to any of you or if there are flaws with it, but here's the link if you want to give it a try. Thanks, Have a good day!\n\n**Links:** [https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt)\n\n***-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***\n\n***UPDATE: added \"Cinematic Reference Loader\", an Image Loader node which lets the user select an image among the image assets to use for Image-to-Image workflows***",

The node doesn't currently have an `IMAGE` output to send them directly to other nodes via wires.\n\nHowever, if you really like a specific reference image (like the \"Low Angle\" shot for instance) and want to use it for ControlNet, you can find all the source images in your `custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Cinematic_Prompt/web/assets/` folder and load them into a standard 'Load Image' node",

I had a case where the stick figure resulting from dwpose preprocessor crossed in the wrong order, with the blue stick crossing over the green stick, rather than the other way round. I just copied the image  from the preview image, painted the crossing green, and used the resulting image as the input for pose, skipping the whole preprocessor this time.\n2. If the dwpose is correct, but flux 2 klein is still not creating the correct pose, support it with a descriptive text prompt. The text prompt I used for the example image was: \"Change the pose of the subject in image2 to the pose in image1. A medium shot of the woman from knees up, leaning against the door frame. The woman is looking to the side, reading a book. Her left arm is hanging down, holding a wine glass. Her right hand is holding a book. Her left leg is lifted at an angle. Her weight rests on her right leg, which is partly obscured by the left leg.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fnxu205dxdg1.png?width=3409&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e20dd8fe5c4185baf1e22c3f38d91d1ac031ff",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share a quick win and, more importantly, a **huge thank you to this community**. I’ve been lurking and learning here for a while, and I honestly couldn't have pulled this off without the incredible nodes, workflows, and troubleshooting tips shared by everyone here.\n\nI recently had the chance to integrate ComfyUI into a \"real-world\" professional production for **La Centrale** (a major French automotive marketplace), working alongside agencies BETC and Bloom.\n\n**The challenge:** We had to bring a saga of 25 custom-designed cars to life for over 10 different commercials in a very tight 4-week window.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qhuqwr/video/vhhgg7rajgeg1/player\n\n**The process:** To meet the brand's high standards, I deployed a hybrid pipeline: **3D for the structure/consistency and ComfyUI for the design, textures, and realism.** This allowed us to stay incredibly agile while maintaining a level of detail that traditional 3D alone wouldn't have reached in that timeframe.\n\nIt’s definitely not \"perfect,\" and there’s always room for improvement, but it’s a solid proof of concept that our workflows are ready for high-stakes professional advertising.\n\nThanks again for being such an inspiring hub of innovation. This is only the beginning! 🍿💥\n\n*(If anyone is curious about the specific nodes or how I handled the 3D-to-AI pass to keep the cars consistent, I’m happy to answer questions in the comments!)*\n\nmore details about this project : [https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai](https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai)  \n",

After 14 years in the game, I’ve realized that working directly with agencies and clients is a whole different beast compared to running in post-production studio.\nWhen you’re in the driver’s seat of a studio, you have your own flow, but with direct clients, it’s all about hitting that budget without sacrificing the 'wow' factor.\n\n For this project, the real challenge was rock-solid consistency, keeping the same lighting, the same energy, and the same art direction across every single frame and asset.\n\n Honestly, even with a full-blown 3D pipeline, that’s a mountain to climb!\n\nSo, I turned to AI primarily as a smart way to bridge that budget gap. My goal was to take those tools and 'tame' them until the output was 100% production-ready in my little studio\n\nIt’s all about finding that sweet spot between creative tech and real-world constraints",

Smutty fine-tunes of Wan2.2 will get any image moving and grooving. Wan 2.2 Enhanced NSFW is number 1 on civitas for a reason. It's the best. Image-to-Image will get you to where ever you want to go, so the problem is thus reduced to an image (de)generation problem.\n\nFor photoreal image smut, you can use Flux or Qwen or Z-Image probably. They will all give you exactly what you want as long as you plug in the right LoRA and are willing to settle for something that is mostly 1girl.\n\nFor anime image smut, a lot of people seem to go for Illustrious or Pony. If you're willing to settle for something mostly 1girl, these models will also trivially do anything you'd ever want.\n\nThe hardest thing is getting 2+ characters interacting without it looking like some horror show dreamed up by the worshippers of slaanesh. The state of the AI art today is that, to get two characters interacting with a lot of prompt adherence, people start sprouting extra fingers and legs and dicks. So you can either wrestle your way through that (with control nets and in-painting and a lot of random chance) or settle for something more generic.",

There are plenty available at Civit but IMO many of the best ones were deleted. Fortunately, you can still find most of them here...\n\nIt's the loras that turn Wan2.2 from PG-13/softcore into XXX hardcore.\n\n[https://civitaiarchive.com/](https://civitaiarchive.com/)\n\nThe only problem with the photorealistic models currently is that none of them go as easily hardcore as Pony or Illustrious. There ARE mixes for realism and they'll get you most of the way there, but they do not look 100% real or like photos.\n\nBut they will create the most hardcore scenes you can probably imagine. Excellent at anatomy in complex positions of \"interactions\" that none of the truly photorealistic models can manage. They weren't trained specifically on porn - Pony was. Skip Pony 7 entirely. In fact you don't want to use ANY of the Pony base models. You want a Pony finetune.\n\nI'd recommend CyberRealisticPony and there are a few others. You can create hardcore XXX with this model. It's fast, has great anatomy and is HIGHLY knowledgeable about practically every sexual act or position you could want, and I love it! But it's NOT quite photorealism.\n\nChroma is an interesting one. It's a photorealistic model that WAS trained on porn. It exists as a halfway point. Not quite as hardcore as Pony can get but way more \"knowledgeable\" than Qwen or Z-Image Turbo. Its main drawback is sketchy anatomy compared to the others. It CAN do amazing things, but you'll ALSO get a lot of deformities. A lot of almost perfect pics ruined by that deformed foot or extra hand etc. And then BAM... exactly what you were going for.\n\nFor anime smut, you'll have to ask someone else :)",

Since each model excels at something unique, you should start with the model that gives you the pose/camera you want, then send the image to the next ksampler/advanced ksampler to give you color/lighting, and hook the depth map of the first image into it so it keeps the same shape, then send that image with its depth map to the next ksampler which can provide the texture/details (I like Z-image for this step).\n\nThat's just an example, you can invent any pipline you want with each step adding something the previous model couldn't.",
