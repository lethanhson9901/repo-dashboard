The problem is most of these services don't give you terminal access - so I couldn't use Claude Code with them.\n\nComfy Pilot has two parts:\n\n\\- MCP server - gives Claude Code full access to your workflow (view, edit, connect nodes, run, preview images). Works with any local setup.\n\n\\- Embedded terminal - runs Claude Code right inside the ComfyUI browser tab. Useful when you're on a remote instance with no shell access.\n\nInstall: comfy node install comfy-pilot\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot](https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot)\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

Also the auto-downloading models from arbitrary URLs and that curl-to-bash installer situation makes me nervous lol.

Back then Ethan (ethansmith2000) wrote a ton of stuff on it, and provided some of the best guides and cross-testing stuff around in that era imo. You wouldn't happen to be him, would you?\n\nThere was also a little niche Discord that started off somewhere else (can't remember), but ethan, myself and a few others frequented it - but I can't remember the name of that either (my memory is kind of shite these days).\n\nAnd yeah, I'm not a huge fan of apps either. I like the freedom that ComfyUI provides and I use it exclusively these days (outside of some occasional post and tinkering).\n\nCheers. :)\n\nEdit: apologies for the offbeat cadence and occasional redundancy, it's getting late here and I'm absolutely knackered lol.

Small sacrifice for a bigger win, and something I was stubbornly against at first.\n\nSecond, I focused on fixing the color degradation. I tried color matching, but it introduced its own issues. Tried boosting saturation, but the colors looked unnatural. Then, out of curiosity, I tweaked the contrast instead and that basically gave the cleanest result.\n\nIn short, those two tiny changes turned out to be the workable solution.",

With this model, I got consistent and acceptable results. So I guess the NSFW merge is a requirement for this workflow? I suggest documenting that so other users don't have to hunt down the model like I did. \n\n- Just a thought: Is there a strength parameter or something that your SVI/FLF2V node could expose to make it work better with stock Wan models? A growing percentage of the world is becoming unable to access CivitAI, so not everybody is going to be able to download that checkpoint.   \n\nAnyway, thanks for this. If I can get your node to perform better with stock Wan, I can see myself using this in my own workflows. It might be a step forward.",

You can find it here: [https://github.com/Well-Made/ComfyUI-Wan-SVI2Pro-FLF](https://github.com/Well-Made/ComfyUI-Wan-SVI2Pro-FLF)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38vs6y4897kg1.png?width=3683&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ae8a6ff619b63828ef9e9aec68c06ff7224fe0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngyktecxi7kg1.png?width=1555&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dad0a74e3a584669bca1032daf92a762408a2c5\n\nFinally managed to add Wan 2.2 First/Last Frame functionality to SVI 2 Pro. Essentially, it's a custom node combining both features. The beginning of the clip tries to continue previous movements and overall to make the scene as consistent as possible, while the end pushes toward the last frame along the shortest path. These are two competing algorithms, and if their paths diverge too much, this breaks continuity. So it's either to create more intermediate frames using an image editing model, or to increase the clip length to give it more breathing room and use a more thoughtful prompt to guide the generation, though if the scene doesn't change much, the prompt usually isn't needed.\n\nThe workflow is mostly usable, at least it's a lot cleaner now, though I want to make another version.\n\nI want to create a repo with the node and workflow, but I'm still figuring out the GitHub side. Never published anything there before, so I'm not sure how to handle the fact that it's based on others' work, albeit with added functionality.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1r7x1nw/video/yv27zirhm7kg1/player",
