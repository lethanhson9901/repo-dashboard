Back then Ethan (ethansmith2000) wrote a ton of stuff on it, and provided some of the best guides and cross-testing stuff around in that era imo. You wouldn't happen to be him, would you?\n\nThere was also a little niche Discord that started off somewhere else (can't remember), but ethan, myself and a few others frequented it - but I can't remember the name of that either (my memory is kind of shite these days).\n\nAnd yeah, I'm not a huge fan of apps either. I like the freedom that ComfyUI provides and I use it exclusively these days (outside of some occasional post and tinkering).\n\nCheers. :)\n\nEdit: apologies for the offbeat cadence and occasional redundancy, it's getting late here and I'm absolutely knackered lol.

Basically, by second 20 you're fapping to someone else than second 1, even with helper LORA's.\n\nIt works great with \"normal\" content and the full WAN model which is of course non-NSFW, but the more distilled versions like the popular NSFW ones turn out disappointing in my experience.",

Small sacrifice for a bigger win, and something I was stubbornly against at first.\n\nSecond, I focused on fixing the color degradation. I tried color matching, but it introduced its own issues. Tried boosting saturation, but the colors looked unnatural. Then, out of curiosity, I tweaked the contrast instead and that basically gave the cleanest result.\n\nIn short, those two tiny changes turned out to be the workable solution.",

After a bit of struggling, I got it working.  \n\nSome notes:  \n\n- At first, running with your default settings and the stock Wan 2.2 I2V models, I got a slideshow until I realized the workflow seems to assume that you're running a Wan checkpoint that has lightx2v baked in.   \n\n- After adding lightx2v to the lora loaders, I got a *little* motion mixed with crossfades, but nothing near a proper FLF2V generation. \n\n- Finally, I tracked down the checkpoint that your model loaders have selected. With this model, I got consistent and acceptable results. So I guess the NSFW merge is a requirement for this workflow? I suggest documenting that so other users don't have to hunt down the model like I did. \n\n- Just a thought: Is there a strength parameter or something that your SVI/FLF2V node could expose to make it work better with stock Wan models? A growing percentage of the world is becoming unable to access CivitAI, so not everybody is going to be able to download that checkpoint.   \n\nAnyway, thanks for this. If I can get your node to perform better with stock Wan, I can see myself using this in my own workflows. It might be a step forward.",

Essentially, it's a custom node combining both features. The beginning of the clip tries to continue previous movements and overall to make the scene as consistent as possible, while the end pushes toward the last frame along the shortest path. These are two competing algorithms, and if their paths diverge too much, this breaks continuity. So it's either to create more intermediate frames using an image editing model, or to increase the clip length to give it more breathing room and use a more thoughtful prompt to guide the generation, though if the scene doesn't change much, the prompt usually isn't needed.\n\nThe workflow is mostly usable, at least it's a lot cleaner now, though I want to make another version.\n\nI want to create a repo with the node and workflow, but I'm still figuring out the GitHub side. Never published anything there before, so I'm not sure how to handle the fact that it's based on others' work, albeit with added functionality.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1r7x1nw/video/yv27zirhm7kg1/player",

I also updated CivitAI helper to stop printing in console any skips and errors not found, as it slows down processing to need to print each reply.\n\nIt's great to see more tools like this for Comfy, maybe one day i'll finally migrate away from Forge for anime.",

Makes it a bit limiting when trying to create your own poses from scratch.\n\nMany thanks for posting the workflow...I'm having fun with it! Cheers!",
