That is exactly what I am doing.\nInstead of relying on preprocessors (like DWPose or ZoeDepth) to \"guess'\" the skeleton and depth from a video, which often results in flickering or jittery limbs, I am rendering the data directly from the 3D scene.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nIt is running Three.js (WebGL) directly inside the ComfyUI frontend. The node handles the 3D scene in the browser, snaps the frame buffers (OpenPose colors, Depth, Canny, Normal), and sends them back to the Python backend. It’s lightweight and doesn't require running a separate heavy application in the background.\n\nI'm not just rendering a stick figure, I have a custom skinned mesh (Geo_OpenPose) where the limbs act as the \"bones\" and are colored with the exact OpenPose ID colors. This handles occlusion perfectly in theory (for instance, if an arm goes behind the body, the bone disappears correctly, whereas preprocessors often get confused and draw the arm on top).\n\nYou are right that Blender is superior for creating or editing the animation. My node is designed for the Generation Pipeline. The workflow is: Create your animation in Blender/Mixamo once -> Import GLB/FBX to Comfy -> Batch render perfect ControlNet passes instantly while tweaking your prompts. \nIt saves you from having to render out thousands of frames in Blender every time you want to test a new camera angle or lighting setup.",

Is there a way to have some kind of \"template\" for `positive_text`? I would like to test the same prompt except for a single word/tag.\n\nLooking at the README, maybe I could try some kind of hacky workaround using \"Positive Start\" but that's uniquely for LoRA it seems.\n\nWell, in the end if it's not an existing feature I'll just write up some script to generate an array of `positive_text`, it's not a lot of work!",

In the Config Builder UI it's labeled as **Positive Prompt Groups.**\n\nThe sampler node positive text input also accepts nested JSON arrays and uses python's itertools to expand them! So you can plug it in directly in the sampler or also in the Builder UI which has both the visual builder mode and raw JSON mode!\n\n\\* Edit: Someone else mentioned they didn't see that section in the UI. I have noticed that sometimes the Comfy Manager is a little slow to list the latest numbered version releases. Did you perhaps install a version older than 1.9.1? It's supposed to be the latest version. Maybe switching to the nightly version in the manager will get you the latest updates.",

I won’t even get into the fact that many of them have zero visual sense and their generated stuff often looks bad. -\\_-\n\nAnyway, I’m really curious how much is AI actually being used in your area of VFX?",

I'm building an open-source tool called ComfyGit that leverages uv to enable reproducibility and version control: git-tracked environments via a single pyproject.toml manifest where nodes, models, and ComfyUI version are all pinned. The idea is you export a working environment, import it on another machine, and everything just installs and runs. It's available as a custom node via the Manager right now (ComfyGit-Manager is the node name). Here's the [github link](https://github.com/comfygit-ai/comfygit-manager) if interested.  \nWould love to compare approaches, looks like we have different architectures solving a similar problem space!",

This looks promising, I haven't looked further than the readme, but here is what i understood so far: \n\n1. **Versioning:**  I think there are two sides of versions: \n   1. Internal: where each changes is tracked automatically, because as a user can install many packages or nodes, if I missed a commit, I might need to revert all changes, rather than reverting a specific revision. \n   2. External: That's where ComfyGit seems to be more useful, push each change to Git when environment is stable. \n2. **Import/Export ComfyUI env:** Definitely a great job there. \n3. **Running it as Custom Node:** This is where I am a little bit concerned, in case the ComfyUI breaks because of a package or node, This node also becomes unusable. \n\n  \nBut sure we are working on same problem with different approach, would love to chat more & even happy to collaborate on a common project.

Some kind of auto-commit system would certainly be useful, I was worried about node installs and environment configuration leading to lots of 'noise' in the commit history, but if it saves you when needing to rollback then it's probably worth the tradeoff.  \n3. Yep this is why you can also run ComfyGit as a full-featured CLI! If the environment bricks or the orchestrator gets stuck (happens) then I use the CLI to reboot/rollback the environment. Since the core is just a library it can integrate with multiple frontends pretty easily (I'm thinking of adding a standalone launcher in the future).  \nHappy to chat more!",

The surrealism art movement was all about pushing aside the obstacle of conscious thought and decision making and accessing the raw underlying depths of humanity beneath it. AI is trained on raw humanity, the good, the bad, the mundane, on epic scale. and aside from only its parametric nature those obstacles are obviously not present in a diffusion model. AI is the perfect tool for surrealism, arguably better than a human could even hope to achieve.",

The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

Since the baseline quality of these models differs, it’s hard to compare VACE across them purely by chunk size.\n\nThis works on LongLive, StreamDiffusion v2, and Krea Realtime, etc,  because they’re distilled from Wan 2.1 which is the arch VACE was designed for. If a different architecture like Wan 2.2 or LTX-2 either supports autoregressive streaming or gets distilled into that form, adapting VACE-style conditioning would be theoretically possible.",

This project startet small and grew very quickly, and after a few more copy and pastes it looked like this which amused me quite a bit so I postet it on reddit.\n\nI do not intend to actually use this, I did a last \"test-run\" this night and it passed and now I have no Idea what to do with it. But I knew that before and it did not bother me.\n\nIf you wonder what this workflow does:\n\n\\- Takes one input image and creates a few hundred variation of that image with different background, different general styles etc.\n\n\\- Some things like the background are random and some thing are always the same for specific Image (e.g. the first generated Image is always cartoon style but the background is random)\n\n\\- It saves the Images with a specific output Name based on the Style and the Input Image Name.\n\n\\- Most generated Images are based on the input Image but some are based on previous generated Images from the same run.\n\nNow I will move forward to video creation, I'm curios how this will end up. And who knows,  maybe I can combine my video workflow with this Image workflow :D",

Detailing on the shoulder pads are asymmetrical, the same goes for the braces, gloves and fingers, thigh armor(?), leg braces, and especially the feet.\n\nOn a more subjective note, this kind of approach tends to add \"too much\" detail. Every surface and part of this image is rugged, grained, and super granular. Even the sky is grainy. The stained glass windows in the back doesn't make sense, the every spire is different and weirdly spiked and shaped. The cloth parts have a very inconsistently spiked metal trim (is that even a thing?), every surface is bumpy/spikey/stained, etc.\n\nNo surface is smooth, clean or flat. It's hard to put into words beyond that, but all of it together screams mediocre AI image if you look at it for more than 10 seconds, at least IMO.\n\nI think that's why it's important to remember inpainting can work to add detail where necessary and appropriate, as well as fix asymmetrical inconsistencies. Applying a blank \"add more detail\" filter rarely works well.\n\nJust my 2 cents though, don't let my critique stop you from enjoying your AI images.",

For example if you want a vast micro-detaild landscape nothing beats this workflow you could drop the detail start to 10 and the end to 100 exponent to 50 bias to 0 taking your same single building landscape prompt and making it a massive landscape covered in detailed structures. Creating people would be more in the range of start 50 end 100 bias 10 exponent 1.50... and with adding detail or changing features to already existing images you can take a 512x768 picture and make it a 4k masterpiece with the right settings",

In my example below, the source image is not very good (OP prompt with zimage), Klein upscale it 'as is' (image on the right side). Op workflow (middle image) is more creative for sure. The texture on the sword looks nice. Note the sky quite noisy. In other tests made with indoor scenes, it does vary the noise on wall textures, making a quite old-fashion AI-upscale picture.\n\nAdapting the wf to Klein could make sense...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na1gcfzqxdjg1.jpeg?width=4278&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af1773baf3cd5c597e49f856bd7f68de27b56504\n\n",

The problem is most of these services don't give you terminal access - so I couldn't use Claude Code with them.\n\nComfy Pilot has two parts:\n\n\\- MCP server - gives Claude Code full access to your workflow (view, edit, connect nodes, run, preview images). Works with any local setup.\n\n\\- Embedded terminal - runs Claude Code right inside the ComfyUI browser tab. Useful when you're on a remote instance with no shell access.\n\nInstall: comfy node install comfy-pilot\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot](https://github.com/ConstantineB6/Comfy-Pilot)\n\nHappy to answer any questions.",

The second thing is, you need to specify sex is happening and the position.\n\n\"\"a woman is laying on her back, spreading her legs wide, having missionary sex with a man. The man, positioned between her legs in the missionary position, inserts his large erect penis into the woman's vagina, thrusting back and forth as the woman closes her eyes and moans in pleasure”\n\nDreamly especially is good with sex positions but you have to specify them.  \n\nWhat I can also do is add several position specific loras at about .6 a piece, but most of them require specific phrases to trigger- so be sure to read those.",
