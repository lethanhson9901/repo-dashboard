The workflow is straightforward: add the ComfySketch node to your graph and draw the pose directly with a tablet pen.\n\nThe prompt I used:\n\n>Make the person in Image 1 take exactly the same pose as the person in Image 2. Changing the style or background of the person in Image 1 is not appropriate, so do not do that. The new pose should be pixel-accurate to the pose we are copying. The positions of the arms, head, and legs should match the pose we want to copy. Change the view and angle to exactly match Image 2. The head tilt and eye direction should also match the person in Image 2.\n\nworkflow: [https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230](https://gist.github.com/zhangkun-0/471b5d442ac07832f06ee9b6f3644230)\n\nAuthor link:  \n[Drawing node for ComfyUI (ComfySketch)](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1qvo6m7/drawing_node_for_comfyui_comfysketch/)  \nby[u/Vivid-Loss9868](https://www.reddit.com/user/Vivid-Loss9868/) in[comfyui](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/)",

UI had some issues when loading Loras (post training). \n\nI only tried 1 training loop using 45 reference Trance tracks with default settings. Training loss is very high imo and the Lora came out of it was bad. Even a 4090 takes a very long time to generate a decent dataset let alone the training part. More than I'm willing to spend time on. \n\nI am a music producer and this model, even with Loras, doesn't even come close to what Suno can do.

For instance, going to FA2 would greatly speed this process up, but it is only used for inference I think.

The 16GB VRAM on this AMD works a lot better.\n\nThe Nvidia seems more universally compatible but considering how great this RX 6800 works and it isn't even officially supported I think that AMD will be closing in the gap soon once better driver support comes in for these models. \n\nI hope this can happen soon cause Nvidia has pretty much killed consumer video cards  it's either an 8GB card which can't do anything or spend thousands of dollars on a high end card.

Real-world physics, materials, and lighting. Shot as if captured by a high-resolution IMAX aerial documentary camera with dramatic slow-motion stop-motion animation style, ultra-detailed frame-by-frame geological textures and stone erosion visible in motion. No stylization, no painterly effects, no fantasy glow. Dynamic god's-eye aerial tracking shot starting with ultra-wide establishing shot of infinite tan desert continent devoid of vegetation, camera slowly dollies forward and zooms in progressively from 100mm wide lens to tight 400mm telephoto close-up on one colossal jet-black basalt cathedral megacity carved into sheer cliff face. Precise camera path: begin high overhead aerial orbit revealing endless serpentine basalt mountain ranges and scattered satellite fortress towns, then smooth forward tracking descent following elevated black stone causeway toward target megacity, gradually narrowing focus while maintaining background depth showing another freestanding jet-black cathedral complex rising from desert flats 5km distant with maze-like defensive walls snaking across foreground flats. Final tight zoom reveals intricate Gothic lancet windows, flying buttresses, weathered basalt blocks with micro-cracks, soot stains, and mineral streaks on the cliff-carved spires and terraces, shadows cast sharp geometric patterns across eroded stone surfaces. No sky visible, no clouds, no fog, no haze, no horizon. Terrain slopes downward foreground, rises infinitely distant forming continuous landmass. Desert surface: compacted sand, cracked clay flats, wind-eroded sediment layers, exposed bedrock, gravel fields, erosion channels, mineral staining, micro-fractures, dust accumulation at true scale showing granular physics in stop-motion frames. Jet-black basalt architecture dominates: chipped edges, uneven blocks, rough grain, soot, water marks, matte-semi-gloss variations. Continuous mountain chains with layered escarpments, jagged ridgelines, sheer cliffs, columnar formations, ravines. Megacity details: vertical terraces, stair systems, deep chambers embedded in rock, surrounded by labyrinthine black stone walls with choke points, dead ends, enclosed courtyards. Satellite towns: compact fortress-cathedrals with squat towers, crenellations, narrow streets. Elevated walkways, arched bridges, aqueducts linking structures. Jet-black rivers, blackwater swamps with eroded banks. Harsh directional sunlight, high contrast hard shadows, deep occlusion shadows, intense surface definition. National Geographic IMAX documentary footage style, extreme micro-detail clarity at all scales, perfect resolution, real cities real stone real erosion, monumental oppressive infinite worldscape captured in slow deliberate stop-motion aerial zoom revealing construction scale and geological majesty.\n\nThen made the original image in Klein 9b -> i2i with ZIT and a depth controlnet -> upscale with Seedvr2 -> then Klein 9b - make this image photorealistic",

After few attempts writing things like, rave, techno, fast punchy bass, female vocals i got pretty decent results, even if Ace step can do incredible things,but for my dirty mind it  this is good enough.\n\nBut me beeing me I wasnt satisfied with song only so i decided to make a whole music video. Firstly created two lora characters for all three, Z turbo image, Flux Klein base 9b and wan 2.2 (only picture lora so charaters stay the same when they turn they head around). I was mainly using Z image turbo then flux klein to change scene or angle then second pass with low denoise in z image turbo to get realism back.\n\nThen after hundreads of image generation i settled for like 60 of them and put them trough basic wan 2.2 i2v with NSFWfastmove checkpoint because it gives better results then smoothmix, singing part in video is done with ltx2 audio sync workflow. Later edited in Premiere Pro.\n\nMusic video was generated in 1280x720 resolution then upscaled 2 times to 2560x1440 and interpolated wan parts from 16fps to 24.\n\nYou can ask me whatever you want about the video or workflows, Im glad to help. Video is only partialy uploaded to reddit cause NSFW.\n\nLyrics are... Well you will hear it yourself, this is semi serious/meme Rave/techno/house video so like it or hate it the choice is yours! <3\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qzbqn2/video/m9gpfwu4jaig1/player\n\n",

They are all connected, not bunch of random pictures, they tell some kind of \"linear story\". \nBasically its silly story but anyways, here it is, this was an idea:\n\nVillage girl with kinky personallity enjoys her hometown then goes to town near her birthplace, seduces rich guy, has xxx with him on his yatch, her $lutty personallity come to surface. Goes to city because city now maches her new persona so does the style, she stops hiding her new personallity, and at the end scenes she becomes true $lut by killing her old self and embracing her new personalitty as who she really is now.\n\nThen as you said, stiched 5 seconds videos  via premiere pro generated in wan 2.2. while keeping eye on the flow, rythm and storytelling. Even if its not perfect...\n\nHope i helped!",

That is exactly what I am doing.\nInstead of relying on preprocessors (like DWPose or ZoeDepth) to \"guess'\" the skeleton and depth from a video, which often results in flickering or jittery limbs, I am rendering the data directly from the 3D scene.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nIt is running Three.js (WebGL) directly inside the ComfyUI frontend. The node handles the 3D scene in the browser, snaps the frame buffers (OpenPose colors, Depth, Canny, Normal), and sends them back to the Python backend. It’s lightweight and doesn't require running a separate heavy application in the background.\n\nI'm not just rendering a stick figure, I have a custom skinned mesh (Geo_OpenPose) where the limbs act as the \"bones\" and are colored with the exact OpenPose ID colors. This handles occlusion perfectly in theory (for instance, if an arm goes behind the body, the bone disappears correctly, whereas preprocessors often get confused and draw the arm on top).\n\nYou are right that Blender is superior for creating or editing the animation. My node is designed for the Generation Pipeline. The workflow is: Create your animation in Blender/Mixamo once -> Import GLB/FBX to Comfy -> Batch render perfect ControlNet passes instantly while tweaking your prompts. \nIt saves you from having to render out thousands of frames in Blender every time you want to test a new camera angle or lighting setup.",

The same parameter relationships govern how models learn: Illustrative brush strokes and hatching, Cloud formation patterns and atmospheric texture, Skin pores, fabric weave, paper tooth, Any style-defining detail below the compositional signal threshold\n\nAnd critically, the inverse application: If you understand how to *amplify* low-noise learning, you inherently understand how to *suppress* it, directing model capacity toward high-frequency attributes like composition, lighting architecture, and color relationships instead.\n\nThis is training methodology research using film grain as a controlled test case because as somebody who makes generate image professionally every day I realize the place most models fall short is in low noise pattern learning. This not a subjective aesthetic preference study.",

      "text": "# What is this?\n\nThis is an almost copy-paste of a post I've made on [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/2376532?modelVersionId=2672614) (to explain the formatting).\n\nZ-image base produces really, *really* realistic images, really easily. Aside from being creative & flexible the quality is also generally higher than the distils (as usual for non-distils), so it's worth using if you want really creative/flexible shots at the best possible quality. IMO it's the best model for realism out of the ones I've tried (Klein 9B base, Chroma, SDXL), especially because you can natively gen at high resolution.\n\nThis post is to share a simple starting workflow with good sampler/scheduler settings & resolutions pre-set for ease. There are also a bunch of tips for using Z-image base below and some general info you might find helpful.\n\nThe sampler settings are geared towards sharpness and clarity, but you can introduce grain and other defects through prompting.\n\nYou can grab the workflow from the Civitai link above or from here: [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/NZfX4MRJ)\n\nHere's a short album of example images, all of which were generated directly with this workflow with no further editing (SFW except for a couple of mild bikini shots): [imgbb](https://ibb.co/album/KxXLj8) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iwZAvs_Qa6h49fuPlsB5AJs3JqUy2hSX?usp=sharing)\n\n# Nodes & Models\n\n**Custom Nodes:**\n\n[RES4LYF](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF) \\- A very popular set of samplers & schedulers, and some very helpful nodes. These are needed to get the best z-image base outputs, IMO.\n\n[RGTHREE](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy) \\- (Optional) A popular set of helper nodes. If you don't want this you can just delete the seed generator and lora stacker nodes, then use the default comfy lora nodes instead. RES4LYF comes with a seed generator node as well, I just like RGTHREE's more.\n\n[ComfyUI GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) \\- (Optional) Lets you load GGUF models, which for some reason ComfyUI still can't do natively. If you want to use a non-GGUF model you can just skip this, delete the UNET loader node and replace it with the normal 'load diffusion model' node.\n\n**Models:**\n\n***Main model:*** [Z-image base GGUFs](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Z-Image-GGUF/tree/main) \\- BF16 recommended if you have 16GB+ VRAM. Q8 will just barely fit on 8GB VRAM if you know what you're doing (not easy). Q6\\_k will fit easily in 8GB. Avoid using FP8, the Q8 gguf is better.\n\n***Text Encoder:*** [Normal](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/z_image/tree/main/split_files/text_encoders) | [gguf](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF/tree/main) Qwen 3 4B \\- Grab the biggest one that fits in your VRAM, which would be the full normal one if you have 10GB+ VRAM or the Q8 GGUF otherwise. Some people say text encoder quality doesn't matter much & to use a lower sized one, but it absolutely does matter and can drastically affect quality. For the same reason, do not use an abliterated text encoder unless you've tested it and compared outputs to ensure the quality doesn't suffer.\n\nIf you're using the GGUF text encoder, swap out the \"Load CLIP\" node for the \"ClipLoader (GGUF)\" node.\n\n***VAE:*** [Flux 1.0 AE](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/z_image/tree/main/split_files/vae)\n\n# Info & Tips\n\n## Sampler Settings\n\nI've found that a two-stage sampler setup gives very good results for z-image base. The first stage does 95% of the work, and the second does a final little pass with a low noise scheduler to bring out fine details. It produces very clear, very realistic images and is particularly good at human skin.\n\nCFG 4 works most of the time, but you can go up as high as CFG 7 to get different results.\n\nThis is all with shift 1. If you don't know what that is, don't worry - it's the default!\n\n**Stage 1:**\n\nSampler - res\\_2s\n\nScheduler - beta\n\nSteps - 22\n\nDenoise: 1.00\n\n**Stage 2:**\n\nSampler - res\\_2s\n\nScheduler - normal\n\nSteps - 3\n\nDenoise: 0.15\n\n## Resolutions\n\n### High res generation\n\nOne of the best things about Z-image in general is that it can comfortably handle very high resolutions compared to other models. You can gen in high res and use an upscaler immediately without needing to do any other post-processing.\n\n(info on upscalers + links to some good ones further below)\n\n**Note:** high resolutions take a long time to gen. A 1280x1920 shot takes around \\~95 seconds on an RTX 5090, and a 1680x1680 shot takes \\~110 seconds.\n\n### Different sizes & aspect ratios change the output\n\nDifferent resolutions and aspect ratios can often drastically change the composition of images. If you're having trouble getting something ideal for a given prompt, try using a higher or lower resolution or changing the aspect ratio.\n\nIt will change the amount of detail in different areas of the image, make it more or less creative (depending on the topic), and will often change the lighting and other subtle features too.\n\nI suggest generating in one big and one medium resolution whenever you're working on a concept, just to see if one of the sizes works better for it.\n\n### Good resolutions\n\nThe workflow has a variety of pre-set resolutions that work very well. They're grouped by aspect ratio, and they're all **divisible by 16**. Z-image base (as with most image models) works best when dimensions are divisible by 16, and some models *require* it or else they mess up at the edges.\n\nHere's a picture of the different resolutions if you don't want to download the workflow: [imgbb](https://ibb.co/S7rKtzfT) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfDGjvITdzxdhkD6u2mP4Eh6U0YuU575/view?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can go higher than 1920 to a side, but I haven't done it much so I'm not making any promises. Things do tend to get a bit weird when you go higher, but it is possible.\n\nI do most of my generations at 1920 to a side, except for square images which I do at 1680x1680. I sometimes use a lower resolution if I like how it turns out more (e.g. the picture of the rat is 1680x1120).\n\n## Realism Negative Prompt\n\nThe negative prompt matters a lot with z-image base. I use the following to get consistently good realism shots:\n\n> 3D, ai generated, semi realistic, illustrated, drawing, comic, digital painting, 3D model, blender, video game screenshot, screenshot, render, high-fidelity, smooth textures, CGI, masterpiece, text, writing, subtitle, watermark, logo, blurry, low quality, jpeg, artifacts, grainy\n\n## Prompt Structure\n\nYou essentially just want to write clear, simple descriptions of the things you want to see. Your first sentence should be a basic intro to the subject of the shot, along with the style. From there you should describe the key features of the subject, then key features of other things in the scene, then the background. Then you can finish with compositional info, lighting & any other meta information about the shot.\n\nUse new lines to separate key parts out to make it easier for you to read & build the prompt. The model doesn't care about new lines, they're just for you.\n\nIf something doesn't matter to you, don't include it. You don't need to specify the lighting if it doesn't matter, you don't need to precisely say how someone is posed, etc; just write what matters to you and slowly build the prompt out with more detail as needed.\n\nYou don't need to include parts that are implied by your negative prompt. If you're using the realism negative prompt I mentioned earlier, you don't usually need to specify that it's a photograph.\n\nYour structure should look something like this (just an example, it's flexible):\n\n> A <style> shot of a <subject + basic description> doing <something>. The <subject> has <more detail>. The subject is <more info>. There is a <something else important> in <location>. The <something else> is <more detail>.\n>\n> The background is a <location>. The scene is <lit in some way>. The composition frames <something> and <something> from <an angle or photography term or whatever>.\n\nFollowing that structure, here are a couple of the prompts for the images attached to this post. You can check the rest out by clicking on the images in Civitai, or just ask me for them in the comments.\n\n**The ballet woman**\n\n> A shot of a woman performing a ballet routine. She's wearing a ballet outfit and has a serious expression. She's in a dynamic pose.\n>\n> The scene is set in a concert hall. The composition is a close up that frames her head down to her knees. The scene is lit dramatically, with dark shadows and a single shaft of light illuminating the woman from above.\n\n**The rat on the fence post**\n\n> A close up shot of a large, brown rat eating a berry. The rat is on a rickety wooden fence post. The background is an open farm field.\n\n**The woman in the water**\n\n> A surreal shot of a beautiful woman suspended half in water and half in air. She has a dynamic pose, her eyes are closed, and the shot is full body. The shot is split diagonally down the middle, with the lower-left being under water and the upper-right being in air. The air side is bright and cloudy, while the water side is dark and menacing.\n\n**The space capsule**\n\n> A woman is floating in a space capsule. She's wearing a white singlet and white panties. She's off-center, with the camera focused on a window with an external view of earth from space. The interior of the space capsule is dark.\n\n## Upscaling\n\nZ-image makes very sharp images, which means you can directly upscale them very easily. Conventional upscale models rely on sharp/clear images to add detail, so you can't reliably use them on a model that doesn't make sharp images.\n\nMy favourite upscaler for NAKED PEOPLE or human face close-ups is [4xFaceUp](https://huggingface.co/Phips/4xFaceUpDAT). It's ridiculously good at skin detail, but has a tendency to make everything else look a bit stringy (for lack of a better word). Use it when a human being showing lots of skin is the main focus of the shot.\n\nHere's a **6720x6720** version of the sitting bikini girl that was upscaled directly using the 4xFaceUp upscaler: [imgbb](https://ibb.co/ks2LRnxT) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10w6DXuHM0j2RivN4hRwKq-jPicyjg-27/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFor general upscaling you can use something like [4xNomos2](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-Nomos2-hq-dat2).\n\nAlternatively, you can use [SeedVR2](https://github.com/numz/ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler), which also has the benefit of working on blurry images (not a problem with z-image anyway). It's not as good at human skin as 4xFaceUp, but it's better at everything else. It's also very reliable and pretty much always works. There's a simple workflow for it here: [https://pastebin.com/9D7sjk3z](https://pastebin.com/9D7sjk3z)\n\n## ClownShark sampler - what is it?\n\nIt's a node from the RES4LYF pack. It works the same as a normal sampler, but with two differences:\n\n1. **\"ETA\"**. This setting basically adds extra noise during sampling using fancy math, and it generally helps get a little bit more detail out of generations. A value of 0.5 is usually good, but I've seen it be good up to 0.7 for certain models (like Klein 9B).\n2. **\"bongmath\"**. This setting turns on bongmath. It's some kind black magic that improves sampling results without any downsides. On some models it makes a big difference, others not so much. I find it does improve z-image outputs. Someone tries to explain what it is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l5uh4d/someone\\_needs\\_to\\_explain\\_bongmath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l5uh4d/someone_needs_to_explain_bongmath/)\n\nYou don't need to use this sampler if you don't want to; you can use the res\\_2s/beta sampler/scheduler with a normal ksampler node as long as you have RES4LYF installed. But seeing as the clownshark sampler comes with RES4LYF anyway we may as well use it.\n\n## Effect of CFG on outputs\n\nLower than 4 CFG is bad. Other than that, going higher has pretty big and unpredictable effects on the output for z-image base. You can usually range from 4 to 7 without destroying your image. It doesn't seem to affect prompt adherence much.\n\nGoing higher than 4 will change the lighting, composition and style of images somewhat unpredictably, so it can be helpful to do if you just want to see different variations on a concept. You'll find that some stuff just works better at 5, 6 or 7. Play around with it, but stick with 4 when you're just messing around.\n\nGoing higher than 4 also helps the model adhere to realism sometimes, which is handy if you're doing something realism-adjacent like trying to make a shot of a realistic elf or something.\n\n## Base vs Distil vs Turbo\n\nThey're good for different things. I'm generally a fan of base models, so most workflows I post are / will be for base models. Generally they give the highest quality but are much slower and can be finicky to use at times.\n\n**What is distillation?**\n\nIt's basically a method of narrowing the focus of a model so that it converges on what you want faster and more consistently. This allows a distil to generate images in fewer steps and more consistently for whatever subject/topic was chosen. They often also come pre-negatived (in a sense, don't @ me) so that you can use 1.0 CFG and no negative prompt. **Distils can be full models or simple loras.**\n\nThe downside of this is that the model becomes more narrow, making it less creative and less capable outside of the areas it was focused on during distillation. For many models it also reduces the quality of image outputs, sometimes massively. Models like Qwen and Flux have god-awful quality when distilled (especially human skin), but luckily Z-image distils pretty well and only loses a little bit of quality. **Generally, the fewer steps the distil needs the lower the quality is.** 4-step distils usually have very poor quality compared to base, while 8+ step distils are usually much more balanced.\n\n**Z-image turbo** is just an official distil, and it's focused on general realism and human-centric shots. It's also designed to run in around 10 steps, allowing it to maintain pretty high quality.\n\nSo, if you're just doing human-centric shots and don't mind a small quality drop, Z-image turbo will work just fine for you. You'll want to use a different workflow though - let me know if you'd like me to upload mine.\n\nBelow are the typical pros and cons of base models and distils. These are pretty much always true, but not always a 'big deal' depending on the model. As I said above, Z-image distils pretty well so it's not too bad, but be careful which one you use - tons of distils are terrible at human skin and make people look plastic (z-image turbo is fine).\n\n**Base model pros:**\n\n* Generally gives the highest quality outputs with the finest details, once you get the hang of it\n* Creative and flexible\n\n**Base model cons:**\n\n* Very slow\n* Usually requires a lengthy negative prompt to get good results\n* Creativity has a downside; you'll often need to generate something several times to get a result you like\n* More prone to mistakes when compared to the focus areas of distils\n   * e.g. z-image base is more likely to mess up hands/fingers or distant faces compared to z-image turbo\n\n**Distil pros:**\n\n* Fast generations\n* Good at whatever it was focused on (e.g. people-centric photography for z-image turbo)\n* Doesn't need a negative prompt (usually)\n\n**Distil cons:**\n\n* Bad at whatever it wasn't focused on, compared to base\n* Usually bad at facial expressions (not able to do 'extreme' ones like anger properly)\n* Generally less creative, less flexible (not always a downside)\n* Lower quality images, sometimes by a lot and sometimes only by a little - depends on the model, the specific distil, and the subject matter\n* Can't have a negative prompt (usually)\n   * You can get access to negative prompts using NAG (not covered in this post)",

That's really handy for making images look realistic if the model can't handle full realism, and it's also a legit personal preference for style as well.\n\nThis workflow is aiming for clear, clean photo-real images. So, by default it won't do what you're looking for. However, you can prompt it in by using terms like \"grainy\" or \"low resolution\" and you could also adjust the sampler settings to get it.\n\nI haven't tested for it specifically, but you could try swapping out the second-stage sampler from res\\_2s to something like res\\_2m or dpm++ which are much noisier. Or switch the scheduler to bong\\_tangent which is super noisy. Those will probably get closer to what you're looking for!\n\nActually you may just want to delete the second-stage sampler entirely and try 40 steps of something like dpm++/normal, euler/bong\\_tangent or euler/beta57. Or 20 steps of res\\_2s/bong\\_tangent. I'm just guessing though, you'll wanna play around with it.",

But ACE-Step 1.5 actually supports a bunch of other task types that weren't exposed - so I built custom guiders for them:\n\n- Edit (Extend/Repaint) - Add new audio before or after existing tracks, or regenerate specific time regions while keeping the rest intact\n- Cover - Style transfer that preserves the semantic structure (rhythm, melody) while generating new audio with different characteristics\n- (wip) Extract - Pull out specific stems like vocals, drums, bass, guitar, etc.\n- (wip) Lego - Generate a specific instrument track that fits with existing audio\n\n\nTime permitting, and based on the level of interest from the community, I will finish the Extract and Lego task custom Guiders. I will be back with semantic hint blending and some other stuff for Edit and Cover. \n\n\nLinks:\n\nWorkflows on CivitAI:\n- https://civitai.com/models/1558969?modelVersionId=2665936\n- https://civitai.com/models/1558969?modelVersionId=2666071\n\nExample workflows on GitHub:\n- Cover workflow: https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RyanOnTheInside/blob/main/examples/ace1.5/audio_ace_step_1_5_cover.json\n- Edit workflow: https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RyanOnTheInside/blob/main/examples/ace1.5/audio_ace_step_1_5_edit.json\n\nTutorial:\n- https://youtu.be/R6ksf5GSsrk\n\nPart of [ComfyUI_RyanOnTheInside](https://github.com/ryanontheinside/ComfyUI_RyanOnTheInside) - install/update via ComfyUI Manager.\n\nLet me know if you run into any issues or have questions and I will try to answer!\n\nLove,\nRyan",

I think I just found the Comfy new release page for it and dl'd whatever they said to use.   It works fine.  I'm not even sure I'm using the Comfy original wf now as I dl'd a bunch from Civitai too. \n\nIt goes in the checkpoints folder, not diffusion\\_models.  So it's got CLIP & VAE built in.  That's why it's called AIO, I guess.  I never use those type of things because I like *more* control over my environment, not less.  I like to at least pick a better text encoder, if available.  If one is not making girl faces, one needs all the help they can get. 😉\n\n",

The numba requirement in your node pack downgrades numpy in my environment, and a lot of other custom nodes have a dependency on numpy, so that comes with some decent risk.",

For local models we would need smarter approach. \n\nOllama - haven't properly tested, you're probably right smaller models would struggle, that is something I'm looking into now - trying to limit context and test it properly with bunch of smaller models.\n\nCollaboration welcome!

No more hallucinated nodes or broken connections that go nowhere.\n* **Auto-Correction:** If a workflow still managed to break, the agent gets the error feedback and tries to fix it automatically. Giving it a 3-retry limit for now so it doesn't loop forever.\n* **Custom Knowledge (.md):** You can drop your own markdown files into `knowledge/user/` to teach it your specific patterns or quirks.\n* **User Templates:** Chuck your favourite `.json` workflows into `workflows/user/` and it’ll use them as a baseline.\n* **Panel Controls:** Added a proper model selector for **Ollama** and context toggles (minimal/standard/verbose) so you can micromanage how much data gets sent.\n* **UI Bits:** Cleaned up the CSS, added a proper 'New Chat' button, and put in a validation display so you can actually see what it’s checking.",
