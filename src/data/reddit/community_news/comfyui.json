This is literally the 3rd or 4th post I've come across that mentioned using the workflow I created a few weeks ago.  \n  \n I really thought it would be of limited use since it was mostly going to be a static camera (due to the lora). There are probably better optimized workflows out there by now which probably haven't gotten as much attention as mine. The workflow  is just a heavily modified workflow of an early and messy \"use your own mp3/audio\" that I found when LTX-2 first came out.   \n  \nBy the way, the steps value in the first pass is actually set really, really high at 25 steps. I meant to update that post with a version 3 to note that you can actually get away with just 15 steps, maybe less in this node. Lowering this allows for higher resolutions or longer videos at certain resolutions. I've seen a few people get up to 40-50s at near 720p if they have your hardware though it is kinda boring watching one shot for that long. I think 15-25 is good for each shot mixed in with non-lip synced audio.   \n\n\nI've taken a bit of a break from Ai generation but it's great to see what people are up to.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gzb5oq6xr4gg1.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=8098263ea646f6310b29aaef0fd33aad39fee2a1",

      "text": "Been obsessed with prompt optimization lately. Wanted to figure out why some prompts produce stunning results while mine look... mid.\n\nSo I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\n**What I found:**\n\n1. **Negative constraints still matter** — telling the model what NOT to do is effective\n2. **Multi-sensory descriptions help** — texture, temperature, even smell make images more vivid\n3. **Group by content type** — structure your prompt based on scene type (portrait, food, product, etc.)\n\nBonus: Once you nail the above, JSON format isn't necessary.\n\n**So I made a system prompt that does this automatically.**\n\nJust plug it into your LLM prompt optimization node, feed it a simple idea like \"a bowl of ramen\", and it expands it into a structured prompt with all those pro techniques baked in.\n\n￼**How to use in ComfyUI:**\n\nUse any LLM node (e.g., GPT, Claude, local LLM) with this as the system prompt. Your workflow would be:\n\nSimple prompt → LLM Node (with this system prompt) → Image Generation\n\n￼**The System Prompt:**\n\n```\nYou are a professional AI image prompt optimization expert. Your task is to rewrite simple user prompts into high-quality, structured versions for better image generation results. Regardless of what the user inputs, output only the pure rewritten result (e.g., do not include \"Rewritten prompt:\"), and do not use markdown symbols.\n\n---\n\n## Core Rewriting Rules\n\n### Rule 1: Replace Feeling Words with Professional Terms\n\nReplace vague feeling words with professional terminology, proper nouns, brand names, or artist names. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Feeling Words | Professional Terms |\n\n|---------------|-------------------|\n\n| Cinematic, vintage, atmospheric | Wong Kar-wai aesthetics, Saul Leiter style |\n\n| Film look, retro texture | Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T |\n\n| Warm tones, soft colors | Sakura Pink, Creamy White |\n\n| Japanese fresh style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics |\n\n| High-end design feel | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus functionalism |\n\nTerm Categories:\n\n- People: Wong Kar-wai, Saul Leiter, Christopher Doyle, Annie Leibovitz\n\n- Film stocks: Kodak Vision3 500T, Cinestill 800T, Fujifilm Superia\n\n- Aesthetics: Wabi-sabi, Bauhaus, Swiss International Style, MUJI visual language\n\n### Rule 2: Replace Adjectives with Quantified Parameters\n\nReplace subjective adjectives with specific technical parameters and values. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Adjectives | Quantified Parameters |\n\n|------------|----------------------|\n\n| Professional photography, high-end feel | 90mm lens, f/1.8, high dynamic range |\n\n| Top-down view, from above | 45-degree overhead angle |\n\n| Soft lighting | Soft side backlight, diffused light |\n\n| Blurred background | Shallow depth of field |\n\n| Tilted composition | Dutch angle |\n\n| Dramatic lighting | Volumetric light |\n\n| Ultra-wide | 16mm wide-angle lens |\n\n### Rule 3: Add Negative Constraints\n\nAdd explicit prohibitions at the end of prompts to prevent unwanted elements.\n\nCommon Negative Constraints:\n\n- No text or words allowed\n\n- No low-key dark lighting or strong contrast\n\n- No high-saturation neon colors or artificial plastic textures\n\n- Product must not be distorted, warped, or redesigned\n\n- Do not obscure the face\n\n### Rule 4: Sensory Stacking\n\nGo beyond pure visual descriptions by adding multiple sensory dimensions to bring the image to life. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\nSensory Dimensions:\n\n- Visual: Color, light and shadow, composition (basics)\n\n- Tactile: \"Texture feels tangible\", \"Soft and tempting\", \"Delicate texture\"\n\n- Olfactory: \"Aroma seems to penetrate the frame\", \"Exudes warm fragrance\"\n\n- Motion: \"Surface gently trembles\", \"Steam wisps slowly descending\"\n\n- Temperature: \"Steamy warmth\", \"Moist\"\n\n### Rule 5: Group and Cluster\n\nFor complex scenes, cluster similar information into groups using subheadings to separate different dimensions.\n\nGrouping Patterns:\n\n- Visual Rules\n\n- Lighting & Style\n\n- Overall Feel\n\n- Constraints\n\n### Rule 6: Format Adaptation\n\nChoose appropriate format based on content complexity:\n\n- Simple scenes (single subject): Natural language paragraphs\n\n- Complex scenes (multiple elements/requirements): Structured groupings\n\n---\n\n## Scene Adaptation Guide\n\nIdentify scene type based on user intent and choose appropriate rewriting strategy. Note: the examples below are for understanding only — do not reuse them. Create original expansions based on user descriptions.\n\n| Scene Type | Recommended Terms | Recommended Parameters | Common Constraints |\n\n|------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n\n| Product Photography | Hasselblad, Apple product aesthetics | Studio lighting, high dynamic range | No product distortion, no text watermarks |\n\n| Portrait Photography | Wong Kar-wai, Annie Leibovitz | 90mm, f/1.8, shallow depth of field | Maintain realistic facial features, preserve identity |\n\n| Food Photography | High-end culinary magazine style | 45-degree overhead, soft side light | No utensil distractions, no text |\n\n| Cinematic | Christopher Doyle, Cinestill 800T | 35mm anamorphic lens, Dutch angle | No low-key dark lighting (unless requested) |\n\n| Japanese Style | Japanese airy feel, Wabi-sabi aesthetics | High-key photography, diffused light | No high-saturation neon colors |\n\n| Design Poster | Swiss International Style, Bauhaus | Grid system, minimal color palette | Clear information hierarchy |\n\n---\n\n## Example\n\n**User Input:\\*\\*\n\na portrait with cinematic feel\n\n**Rewritten Prompt:\\*\\*\n\nCinematic portrait photography, shot through rain-soaked glass at a dimly lit restaurant at night.\n\nVisual Style:\n\nWong Kar-wai and Saul Leiter aesthetics. Deep saturated colors, heavy shadows. Shot with 90mm lens, f/1.8, Kodak Vision3 500T film grain.\n\nLighting & Atmosphere:\n\nNeon green and red city lights refracting through raindrops in the foreground. Soft focus, dreamy, emotionally evocative. The air is filled with moisture, loneliness, and nostalgia.\n\nConstraints:\n\nMaintain realistic facial features. Do not alter identity characteristics.\n\n```\n\n---\n\n￼**The dataset is open source too** — 1,100+ prompts with image links, all in JSON:\n\n👉 [ https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts ](https://github.com/jau123/nanobanana-trending-prompts)\n\nLiveDemo 👉 [meigen.ai](https://www.meigen.ai)\n\nLet me know if you try it out.

          "text": "If you don't mind a bit of criticism, I think your methodology and the conclusions you have drawn are a bit flawed. I appreciate the drive to learn it and share, but you've hit a couple traps that are super common when learning image gen.\n\nThis bit immediately caught my attention:\n\n>So I collected and analyzed 1,000+ trending image prompts from X to find patterns.\n\nSorry, but you didn't collect 1000+ trending prompts. Trending prompts don't exist. What you've done is collect 1000+ trending images and grabbed the prompts from those. They're similar, but they aren't the same thing. \n\nRelying on trending images means you are only sourcing the most attention-grabbing results with no regard for how closely the models followed the prompts. Wanna know what draws the most attention in the AI space online? Your .json of trending prompts contains 479 mentions of the keyword \"woman\", 376 mentions of the word \"girl\", and 212 mentions of the word \"female\". \n\nPeople don't care about the prompt, they care about a pretty picture, and models are experts at delivering a pretty picture. That's basically all they're good for. \n\n[Take this image from Nanobanana Pro](https://i.postimg.cc/dqSZtvNj/nano-4.jpg). Looks cool, right? Imagine I'm some guy on X with a following, and this got a couple hundred likes and retweets, enough for it to hit your scrape. It must have a good prompt for it to be so popular, right?\n\nWell, the prompt for that image is:\n\n>Generate a cinematic film still using the following random tags as inspiration:\n\n>inr, tae, repair, ilovemy, eoin, hurricane, allo, dianne, baddest, elondon, turk, grove, hawk, cabine, bonnet, genuine, big, flashbacks, nare, kavanaugh, ellis, boogie, pies, vandalism, bham, cassidy, schal, rout, mol\n\n>You must not include any text.\n\nIt's clear the prompt is nonsense, but the model made a sick image anyway. That's what they do, they take any input and try their best to turn chicken shit into chicken salad. \n\nThat's a good thing, but that strength also leads a lot of people astray. If you have found any similarities between the prompts, try not to draw the conclusion that \"this is in the prompt, the image is good, therefore the prompt must be good.\" \n\nPeople naturally follow the herd and try looking online to find pretty images to see how it's done, they find one and copy the keywords, but the image they've copied *also* copied those keywords from a different image, which in turn copied from another image, and so on, creating a feedback loop of the blind leading the blind. \n\nAsk any of the prompters in the chain why their image is good, they'll respond with \"It's the prompt.\" Ask them *why* they've included what they have in the prompt and you'll get some variation of \"Because it makes the image better.\" \n\nSeriously, the .json dataset is comprised of tons of overused and unnecessary keywords that have been hanging around long past their use-by date and will barely make a difference in the generation. There are 1232 mentions of the keyword \"realistic\" of which 304 are \"photorealistic\" and 191 are \"ultra-realistic\", 130 \"ultra-detailed\", 8 \"best quality\", 29 \"masterpiece\", 55 \"4k\", 308 \"8k\", hell, there's even 1 \"artstation\" that's made its way through. \n\nWhat your dataset primarily shows is the model is good at making pretty images. What it doesn't show is how to make particular pretty images.\n\nNow, I'm not saying all your recommendations are wrong necessarily. A couple look good, others do not (I didn't think I'd have to write this, but don't prompt for smell, or taste, or sound, or touch. These models are trained on visuals, so use visual descriptors.) \n\nWhat I'm saying is you can't draw conclusions based on the popularity of an image. Again, there's more than 1200 mentions of realistic in your dataset, which must mean it's a good keyword since it's so popular, right? No, if you want a realistic image just include the medium in the prompt. An amateur photo, a cinematic film still, a polaroid, whatever. You only need \"realistic\" to reinforce the medium if the rest of the prompt is pushing towards an unrealistic style.\n\nSorry If I came off like a dick at any point here, it really is super cool you're doing this and sharing it. It's hard to be thorough and diplomatic at the same time when trying to point out flaws in someone's idea. \n\nSo I don't look like a complete dickhead just here to shit on someone else's effort, here's a site that will help you out if you feel like scraping more popular images and their prompts: https://civitlab.devix.pl/ It's the civit gallery, but much more easily searchable.",

Not making excuses, but that is simply what the raw data reflects. I am currently debating whether I should intervene and scrub these 'placebo' tags from the dataset entirely.\n* On Sensory Stacking: I’ll reserve judgment on this one for now. I plan to run more tests to see how much weight the model actually gives them.\n* On Data Sources: My main value proposition is keeping a pulse on X/Twitter trends specifically. It’s a different ecosystem from Civitai. Let's be honest, Civitai definitely has its own heavy bias toward 2.5D and Anime styles too, haha.\nSeriously, thanks for the detailed feedback!",

Maybe you did this but Id suggest you look for popular images posted by accounts with lower follower counts, that should exclude a lot of the noise he mentions from mid images that are just liked because OP has a large following. Then if youve got the skills and determination you could run the images thru a prompt from image LLM and get a list of what the LLM \"sees\" in the image and have it or another LLM cross reference the two and weed out the ones where the image was popular but doesnt stick to the prompt very much.

FLUX.2 is super powerful and surprises me every day, but I know I need to work on learning how the model \"sees\" things and works best to accomplish complex workflows. \n\nI just started playing with depth maps to decouple this.  Particularly when I want to decouple the virtual 'geometry' from the virtual texture maps. It can specify shape and layout without it learning colors, patterns, lighting, etc. from the reference image.\n\nI guess ultimately one could end up with a number of input references (for chars): 1) character likeness,  2) pose,  3) outfit, 4) outfit materials (if you need to change color or fabric), 5) environment, 6) art style/technique.  \n\nSo far I've done stylized portraits of important people with FLUX.2 and the best results have been using a photo (or painting or whatever exists) as an input reference and prompting for a style.   I've only done \"banknote engraving\" and \"engraving by Albrecht Durer\".  But it worked great!  Kontext often sucked.  It reduced them to things like \"a guy with glasses and a moustache\".  Any guy with glasses and a moustache.  The web is filled with portraits like this and I'm not going to make more.  \n\nAn anime character can be approximated fairly easily, but a certain craggy older man's face contains a tremendous amount of detail and to someone hypersensitive like me, even an iconic character like Einstein can look so wrong.  He's just another old guy with wild hair and a moustache.  Sorry, but I've been on a huge \"likeness\" kick because it appears to be disappearing from the web.  Outside of places like here, where people put lots of effort into character likeness, the rest of the web - even big magazines - are putting forth the least amount of effort and make cheesy, crappy images. And I don't whine so much because it's an assault on my eyes as it's because it all gets trained into the next generation of models.  \\[/end rant\\] \n\nFLUX.2 likeness can be \\~70% absolutely perfect.  I might have to gen a 2nd or 3rd at most.  Not, \"kinda looks like\", or \"good from someone no one really knows\".  But wows me on people I know really well and can spot AI gens of instantly.  I need to explore this further as I've just started to try other art mediums with varying success.",

In practice, strong “tone/emotion” prompts often lead to **voice drift** or only subtle/inconsistent emotion changes. If you need consistent emotions, the usual workaround is **separate reference samples per emotion/style** (or using a TTS model that explicitly supports expressive conditioning).\n\nWe’re also keeping an eye on Qwen3-TTS models updates, if/when reliable emotion/style control for cloned voices becomes available (and fits our integration), we’ll evaluate it and ship support in Rebit as soon as we can.",

This experience has only been so satisfying thanks to everyone sharing their knowledge and Workflows here on Reddit and in Discord groups.\n\nWith that in mind, and wanting to create a backup environment for my workflows, I created a repository on GitHub and included all my work so far (I plan to keep updating it).\n\nI wanted to thank this wonderful community and everyone for their contributions. I hope that, at least, these workflows will help someone along the way.\n\nI had a very promising journey a few years ago at Civitai, creating LoRAs of Flux (before the big explosion of censorship and some other topics). I'm thinking about creating a similar repository on Git, sharing techniques for datasets, prompt captures, and training configurations; I'm still figuring out how to do it.\n\nAnyways, see you down the line on this almost endless road of learning and tinkering.  \nCheers!\n\n[https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows](https://github.com/VictorDmAlves/comfyui-workflows)",

It could just be the fp32 precision version of the model released last week.\n\nEdit: The source of the confusion is that everyone has been calling the model released last week (Z-Image) by the name of the teacher model Z-Image Base. The teacher model Z-Image base has not been released yet. If the file name is named Z-Image then it’s likely not the teacher model.",

      "text": "With a recent upgrade to a 5090, I can start training loras with hi-res images containing lots of tiny details. Reading through [this lora training guide](https://civitai.com/articles/7777?highlight=1763669) I wondered if training on high resolution images would work for SDXL or would just be a waste of time. That led me down a rabbit hole that would cost me 4 hours, but it was worth it because I found [this blog post](https://medium.com/@efrat_taig/vae-the-latent-bottleneck-why-image-generation-processes-lose-fine-details-a056dcd6015e) which very clearly explains why SDXL always seems to drop the ball when it comes to \"high frequency details\" and why training it with high-quality images would be a waste of time if I wanted to preserve those details in its output.\n\nThe keyword I was missing was the number of **channels** the VAE model uses. The higher the number of channels, the more detail that can be reconstructed during decoding. SDXL (and SD1.5, Qwen) uses a 4-channel VAE, but the number can go higher. When Flux was released, I saw higher quality out of the model, but far slower generation times. That is because it uses a 16-channel VAE. It turns out Flux is not slower than SDXL, it's simply doing more work, and I couldn't properly appreciate that advantage at the time.\n\nFlux, SD3 (which everyone clowned on), and now the popular Z-Image all use 16-channel VAEs which have lower compression than SDXL, which allows them to reconstruct higher fidelity images. So you might be wondering: why not just use a 16-channel VAE on SDXL? The answer is it's not compatible, the model itself will not accept latent images at the compression ratios that 16-channel VAEs encode/decode. You would probably need to re-train the model from the ground up to give it that ability.\n\nHigher channel count comes at a cost though, which materializes in generation time and VRAM. For some, the tradeoff is worth it, but I wanted crystal clarity before I dumped a bunch of time and energy into lora training. I will probably pick 1440x1440 resolution for SDXL loras, and 1728x1728 or higher for Z-Image.\n\nThe resolution itself isn't what the model learns though, that would be the relationships between the pixels, which can be reproduced at ANY resolution. The key is that some pixel relationships (like in text, eyelids, fingernails) are often not represented in the training data with enough pixels either for the model to learn, or for the VAE to reproduce. Even if the model learned the concept of a fishing net and generated a perfect fishing net, the VAE would still destroy that fishing net before spitting it out.\n\nWith all of that in mind, the reason why early models sucked at hands, and full-body shots had jumbled faces is obvious. The model was doing its best to draw those details in latent space, but the VAE simply discarded those details upon decoding the image. And who gets blamed? Who but the star of the show, the model itself, which in retrospect, did nothing wrong. This is why closeup images express more detail than zoomed-out ones.\n\nSo why does the image need to be compressed at all? Because it would be way too computationally expensive to generate full-resolution images, so the job of the VAE is to compress the image into a more manageable size for the model to work with. This compression is always a factor of 8, so from a lora training standpoint, if you want the model to learn any particular detail, that detail should still be clear when the training image is reduced by 8x or else it will just get lost in the noise.\n\n[The more channels, the less information is destroyed](https://preview.redd.it/ltrsxhyytigg1.png?width=324&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d871b7f22f3066adf852063e1381c6663ff0c20)",

Load your reference audio (5-30 seconds of someone speaking)\n2. ASR auto-transcribes it (no more typing out what they said)\n3. TTS clones the voice and speaks whatever text you want\n\nBoth node packs auto-download models on first use. Works with 52 languages.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* **Qwen3-TTS nodes:** [https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS)\n* **Qwen3-ASR nodes:** [https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-ASR](https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-ASR)\n\nModels used:\n\n* ASR: Qwen/Qwen3-ASR-1.7B (or 0.6B for speed)\n* TTS: Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base\n\nThe TTS pack also supports preset voices, voice design from text descriptions, and fine-tuning on your own datasets if you want a dedicated model.",
