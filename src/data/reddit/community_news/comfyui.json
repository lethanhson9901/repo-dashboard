I just stumbled on this last night and will work in many ways to solve basic cases.  You can even do face replacement.\n\nInstead of creating using and creating a mask and a typical inpainting workflow, instead open the mask tool and use the PAINTBRUSH, select a color like RED, and if you have multiple things use different colors.  Then just tell Qwen to \"Replace red area with face from image 2\" or \"Place coffee cup on table in red area\".\n\nSure, if you have more complex needs for masking, blur, etc... then inpainting is the way to go, but this little hack actually solves a lot of basic inpainting type work.

I also updated CivitAI helper to stop printing in console any skips and errors not found, as it slows down processing to need to print each reply.\n\nIt's great to see more tools like this for Comfy, maybe one day i'll finally migrate away from Forge for anime.",

          "text": ">The main reason we have four million active users on [ComfyUI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/comfyui/) is because we’re open source. Here’s why that was the plan from day one.  \n  \nComfyUI started as a tool Yannick (now one of our cofounders) built because existing AI tools didn’t give enough control.  \n  \nAt the time, platforms were moving toward closed systems. You could generate results, but you couldn’t really see what was happening under the hood. So if something didn’t work the way you wanted, you were stuck.  \n  \nWe didn’t want to build another black box.  \n  \nWe believed creative tools should belong to the people using them. You should be able to run them locally, inspect the workflow, modify the pipeline, and push them as far as you want.  \n  \nSo we ended up making it open source and that turned out to be the best business decision we ever made.  \n  \nBeing open source meant the community had stake, and as our community grew, so did ComfyUI.  \n  \nToday there are 160K people in the ComfyUI subreddit and 51K in Discord.  \n  \nDevelopers are shipping custom nodes. Artists publicly sharing workflows. People debugging things at midnight with strangers on the internet.  \n  \nWe didn’t spend a single dollar on marketing to grow to four million users. We let people build, and that scaled faster than any campaign could.",
