I'm assuming some sort of OpenGL library?\nI tried doing something similar using a blender plugin but it would only output a depth map, and only worked on single frames. On the other hand you could fully edit the animation and bones in blender, which I imagine would be a nightmare to implement in your node.",

That is exactly what I am doing.\nInstead of relying on preprocessors (like DWPose or ZoeDepth) to \"guess'\" the skeleton and depth from a video, which often results in flickering or jittery limbs, I am rendering the data directly from the 3D scene.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\nIt is running Three.js (WebGL) directly inside the ComfyUI frontend. The node handles the 3D scene in the browser, snaps the frame buffers (OpenPose colors, Depth, Canny, Normal), and sends them back to the Python backend. It’s lightweight and doesn't require running a separate heavy application in the background.\n\nI'm not just rendering a stick figure, I have a custom skinned mesh (Geo_OpenPose) where the limbs act as the \"bones\" and are colored with the exact OpenPose ID colors. This handles occlusion perfectly in theory (for instance, if an arm goes behind the body, the bone disappears correctly, whereas preprocessors often get confused and draw the arm on top).\n\nYou are right that Blender is superior for creating or editing the animation. My node is designed for the Generation Pipeline. The workflow is: Create your animation in Blender/Mixamo once -> Import GLB/FBX to Comfy -> Batch render perfect ControlNet passes instantly while tweaking your prompts. \nIt saves you from having to render out thousands of frames in Blender every time you want to test a new camera angle or lighting setup.",

I go from 1.7 FPS to 170 FPS when I delete the Action Node. Could it be something to do with the renderer?",

I actually gave a talk about this at the December ComfyUI meetup in NYC. I'm building an open-source tool called ComfyGit that leverages uv to enable reproducibility and version control: git-tracked environments via a single pyproject.toml manifest where nodes, models, and ComfyUI version are all pinned. The idea is you export a working environment, import it on another machine, and everything just installs and runs. It's available as a custom node via the Manager right now (ComfyGit-Manager is the node name). Here's the [github link](https://github.com/comfygit-ai/comfygit-manager) if interested.  \nWould love to compare approaches, looks like we have different architectures solving a similar problem space!",

This looks promising, I haven't looked further than the readme, but here is what i understood so far: \n\n1. **Versioning:**  I think there are two sides of versions: \n   1. Internal: where each changes is tracked automatically, because as a user can install many packages or nodes, if I missed a commit, I might need to revert all changes, rather than reverting a specific revision. \n   2. External: That's where ComfyGit seems to be more useful, push each change to Git when environment is stable. \n2. **Import/Export ComfyUI env:** Definitely a great job there. \n3. **Running it as Custom Node:** This is where I am a little bit concerned, in case the ComfyUI breaks because of a package or node, This node also becomes unusable. \n\n  \nBut sure we are working on same problem with different approach, would love to chat more & even happy to collaborate on a common project.

Some kind of auto-commit system would certainly be useful, I was worried about node installs and environment configuration leading to lots of 'noise' in the commit history, but if it saves you when needing to rollback then it's probably worth the tradeoff.  \n3. Yep this is why you can also run ComfyGit as a full-featured CLI! If the environment bricks or the orchestrator gets stuck (happens) then I use the CLI to reboot/rollback the environment. Since the core is just a library it can integrate with multiple frontends pretty easily (I'm thinking of adding a standalone launcher in the future).  \nHappy to chat more!",

Since the baseline quality of these models differs, it’s hard to compare VACE across them purely by chunk size.\n\nThis works on LongLive, StreamDiffusion v2, and Krea Realtime, etc,  because they’re distilled from Wan 2.1 which is the arch VACE was designed for. If a different architecture like Wan 2.2 or LTX-2 either supports autoregressive streaming or gets distilled into that form, adapting VACE-style conditioning would be theoretically possible.",

The surrealism art movement was all about pushing aside the obstacle of conscious thought and decision making and accessing the raw underlying depths of humanity beneath it. AI is trained on raw humanity, the good, the bad, the mundane, on epic scale. and aside from only its parametric nature those obstacles are obviously not present in a diffusion model. AI is the perfect tool for surrealism, arguably better than a human could even hope to achieve.",

The goal was to push past emulation and generate an aesthetic that doesn't reference anything that already exists. The model is twice distilled and deliberately overfitted.\n\nThe first synthetic dataset was built from a multi-LoRA pipeline in ComfyUI, used to train the initial version. That model then fed a second image pipeline to generate the training data for the final version. Two generations of synthetic distillation to arrive at this look.\n\nThe animation was done with WAN2.2-I2V-A14B in ComfyUI using a chain of motion models to get the constant speed camera moves and particle systems. The final output was filmed on a CRT and composited with the original renders.\n\n**Recommended Settings:**\n\n* **Base Model:** Flux.1-dev\n* **Resolution:** 1138x640 (horizontal) or 640x1138 (vertical)\n* **Trigger Word:** \"Synthesia\"\n* **LoRA Strength:** 4.5\n* **Flux Guidance:** 1.2\n* **Max Shift:** 1.0\n* **Base Shift:** 8.0\n* **Sampler:** res\\_2m\n* **Scheduler:** beta\n* **Steps:** 35",

Detailing on the shoulder pads are asymmetrical, the same goes for the braces, gloves and fingers, thigh armor(?), leg braces, and especially the feet.\n\nOn a more subjective note, this kind of approach tends to add \"too much\" detail. Every surface and part of this image is rugged, grained, and super granular. Even the sky is grainy. The stained glass windows in the back doesn't make sense, the every spire is different and weirdly spiked and shaped. The cloth parts have a very inconsistently spiked metal trim (is that even a thing?), every surface is bumpy/spikey/stained, etc.\n\nNo surface is smooth, clean or flat. It's hard to put into words beyond that, but all of it together screams mediocre AI image if you look at it for more than 10 seconds, at least IMO.\n\nI think that's why it's important to remember inpainting can work to add detail where necessary and appropriate, as well as fix asymmetrical inconsistencies. Applying a blank \"add more detail\" filter rarely works well.\n\nJust my 2 cents though, don't let my critique stop you from enjoying your AI images.",

For example if you want a vast micro-detaild landscape nothing beats this workflow you could drop the detail start to 10 and the end to 100 exponent to 50 bias to 0 taking your same single building landscape prompt and making it a massive landscape covered in detailed structures. Creating people would be more in the range of start 50 end 100 bias 10 exponent 1.50... and with adding detail or changing features to already existing images you can take a 512x768 picture and make it a 4k masterpiece with the right settings",

In my example below, the source image is not very good (OP prompt with zimage), Klein upscale it 'as is' (image on the right side). Op workflow (middle image) is more creative for sure. The texture on the sword looks nice. Note the sky quite noisy. In other tests made with indoor scenes, it does vary the noise on wall textures, making a quite old-fashion AI-upscale picture.\n\nAdapting the wf to Klein could make sense...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na1gcfzqxdjg1.jpeg?width=4278&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af1773baf3cd5c597e49f856bd7f68de27b56504\n\n",

After few attempts writing things like, rave, techno, fast punchy bass, female vocals i got pretty decent results, even if Ace step can do incredible things,but for my dirty mind it  this is good enough.\n\nBut me beeing me I wasnt satisfied with song only so i decided to make a whole music video. Firstly created two lora characters for all three, Z turbo image, Flux Klein base 9b and wan 2.2 (only picture lora so charaters stay the same when they turn they head around). I was mainly using Z image turbo then flux klein to change scene or angle then second pass with low denoise in z image turbo to get realism back.\n\nThen after hundreads of image generation i settled for like 60 of them and put them trough basic wan 2.2 i2v with NSFWfastmove checkpoint because it gives better results then smoothmix, singing part in video is done with ltx2 audio sync workflow. Later edited in Premiere Pro.\n\nMusic video was generated in 1280x720 resolution then upscaled 2 times to 2560x1440 and interpolated wan parts from 16fps to 24.\n\nYou can ask me whatever you want about the video or workflows, Im glad to help. Video is only partialy uploaded to reddit cause NSFW.\n\nLyrics are... Well you will hear it yourself, this is semi serious/meme Rave/techno/house video so like it or hate it the choice is yours! <3\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1qzbqn2/video/m9gpfwu4jaig1/player\n\n",

They are all connected, not bunch of random pictures, they tell some kind of \"linear story\". \nBasically its silly story but anyways, here it is, this was an idea:\n\nVillage girl with kinky personallity enjoys her hometown then goes to town near her birthplace, seduces rich guy, has xxx with him on his yatch, her $lutty personallity come to surface. Goes to city because city now maches her new persona so does the style, she stops hiding her new personallity, and at the end scenes she becomes true $lut by killing her old self and embracing her new personalitty as who she really is now.\n\nThen as you said, stiched 5 seconds videos  via premiere pro generated in wan 2.2. while keeping eye on the flow, rythm and storytelling. Even if its not perfect...\n\nHope i helped!",

      "text": "# What is this?\n\nThis is an almost copy-paste of a post I've made on [Civitai](https://civitai.com/models/2376532?modelVersionId=2672614) (to explain the formatting).\n\nZ-image base produces really, *really* realistic images, really easily. Aside from being creative & flexible the quality is also generally higher than the distils (as usual for non-distils), so it's worth using if you want really creative/flexible shots at the best possible quality. IMO it's the best model for realism out of the ones I've tried (Klein 9B base, Chroma, SDXL), especially because you can natively gen at high resolution.\n\nThis post is to share a simple starting workflow with good sampler/scheduler settings & resolutions pre-set for ease. There are also a bunch of tips for using Z-image base below and some general info you might find helpful.\n\nThe sampler settings are geared towards sharpness and clarity, but you can introduce grain and other defects through prompting.\n\nYou can grab the workflow from the Civitai link above or from here: [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/NZfX4MRJ)\n\nHere's a short album of example images, all of which were generated directly with this workflow with no further editing (SFW except for a couple of mild bikini shots): [imgbb](https://ibb.co/album/KxXLj8) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iwZAvs_Qa6h49fuPlsB5AJs3JqUy2hSX?usp=sharing)\n\n# Nodes & Models\n\n**Custom Nodes:**\n\n[RES4LYF](https://github.com/ClownsharkBatwing/RES4LYF) \\- A very popular set of samplers & schedulers, and some very helpful nodes. These are needed to get the best z-image base outputs, IMO.\n\n[RGTHREE](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy) \\- (Optional) A popular set of helper nodes. If you don't want this you can just delete the seed generator and lora stacker nodes, then use the default comfy lora nodes instead. RES4LYF comes with a seed generator node as well, I just like RGTHREE's more.\n\n[ComfyUI GGUF](https://github.com/city96/ComfyUI-GGUF) \\- (Optional) Lets you load GGUF models, which for some reason ComfyUI still can't do natively. If you want to use a non-GGUF model you can just skip this, delete the UNET loader node and replace it with the normal 'load diffusion model' node.\n\n**Models:**\n\n***Main model:*** [Z-image base GGUFs](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Z-Image-GGUF/tree/main) \\- BF16 recommended if you have 16GB+ VRAM. Q8 will just barely fit on 8GB VRAM if you know what you're doing (not easy). Q6\\_k will fit easily in 8GB. Avoid using FP8, the Q8 gguf is better.\n\n***Text Encoder:*** [Normal](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/z_image/tree/main/split_files/text_encoders) | [gguf](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-4B-GGUF/tree/main) Qwen 3 4B \\- Grab the biggest one that fits in your VRAM, which would be the full normal one if you have 10GB+ VRAM or the Q8 GGUF otherwise. Some people say text encoder quality doesn't matter much & to use a lower sized one, but it absolutely does matter and can drastically affect quality. For the same reason, do not use an abliterated text encoder unless you've tested it and compared outputs to ensure the quality doesn't suffer.\n\nIf you're using the GGUF text encoder, swap out the \"Load CLIP\" node for the \"ClipLoader (GGUF)\" node.\n\n***VAE:*** [Flux 1.0 AE](https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/z_image/tree/main/split_files/vae)\n\n# Info & Tips\n\n## Sampler Settings\n\nI've found that a two-stage sampler setup gives very good results for z-image base. The first stage does 95% of the work, and the second does a final little pass with a low noise scheduler to bring out fine details. It produces very clear, very realistic images and is particularly good at human skin.\n\nCFG 4 works most of the time, but you can go up as high as CFG 7 to get different results.\n\nThis is all with shift 1. If you don't know what that is, don't worry - it's the default!\n\n**Stage 1:**\n\nSampler - res\\_2s\n\nScheduler - beta\n\nSteps - 22\n\nDenoise: 1.00\n\n**Stage 2:**\n\nSampler - res\\_2s\n\nScheduler - normal\n\nSteps - 3\n\nDenoise: 0.15\n\n## Resolutions\n\n### High res generation\n\nOne of the best things about Z-image in general is that it can comfortably handle very high resolutions compared to other models. You can gen in high res and use an upscaler immediately without needing to do any other post-processing.\n\n(info on upscalers + links to some good ones further below)\n\n**Note:** high resolutions take a long time to gen. A 1280x1920 shot takes around \\~95 seconds on an RTX 5090, and a 1680x1680 shot takes \\~110 seconds.\n\n### Different sizes & aspect ratios change the output\n\nDifferent resolutions and aspect ratios can often drastically change the composition of images. If you're having trouble getting something ideal for a given prompt, try using a higher or lower resolution or changing the aspect ratio.\n\nIt will change the amount of detail in different areas of the image, make it more or less creative (depending on the topic), and will often change the lighting and other subtle features too.\n\nI suggest generating in one big and one medium resolution whenever you're working on a concept, just to see if one of the sizes works better for it.\n\n### Good resolutions\n\nThe workflow has a variety of pre-set resolutions that work very well. They're grouped by aspect ratio, and they're all **divisible by 16**. Z-image base (as with most image models) works best when dimensions are divisible by 16, and some models *require* it or else they mess up at the edges.\n\nHere's a picture of the different resolutions if you don't want to download the workflow: [imgbb](https://ibb.co/S7rKtzfT) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VfDGjvITdzxdhkD6u2mP4Eh6U0YuU575/view?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can go higher than 1920 to a side, but I haven't done it much so I'm not making any promises. Things do tend to get a bit weird when you go higher, but it is possible.\n\nI do most of my generations at 1920 to a side, except for square images which I do at 1680x1680. I sometimes use a lower resolution if I like how it turns out more (e.g. the picture of the rat is 1680x1120).\n\n## Realism Negative Prompt\n\nThe negative prompt matters a lot with z-image base. I use the following to get consistently good realism shots:\n\n> 3D, ai generated, semi realistic, illustrated, drawing, comic, digital painting, 3D model, blender, video game screenshot, screenshot, render, high-fidelity, smooth textures, CGI, masterpiece, text, writing, subtitle, watermark, logo, blurry, low quality, jpeg, artifacts, grainy\n\n## Prompt Structure\n\nYou essentially just want to write clear, simple descriptions of the things you want to see. Your first sentence should be a basic intro to the subject of the shot, along with the style. From there you should describe the key features of the subject, then key features of other things in the scene, then the background. Then you can finish with compositional info, lighting & any other meta information about the shot.\n\nUse new lines to separate key parts out to make it easier for you to read & build the prompt. The model doesn't care about new lines, they're just for you.\n\nIf something doesn't matter to you, don't include it. You don't need to specify the lighting if it doesn't matter, you don't need to precisely say how someone is posed, etc; just write what matters to you and slowly build the prompt out with more detail as needed.\n\nYou don't need to include parts that are implied by your negative prompt. If you're using the realism negative prompt I mentioned earlier, you don't usually need to specify that it's a photograph.\n\nYour structure should look something like this (just an example, it's flexible):\n\n> A <style> shot of a <subject + basic description> doing <something>. The <subject> has <more detail>. The subject is <more info>. There is a <something else important> in <location>. The <something else> is <more detail>.\n>\n> The background is a <location>. The scene is <lit in some way>. The composition frames <something> and <something> from <an angle or photography term or whatever>.\n\nFollowing that structure, here are a couple of the prompts for the images attached to this post. You can check the rest out by clicking on the images in Civitai, or just ask me for them in the comments.\n\n**The ballet woman**\n\n> A shot of a woman performing a ballet routine. She's wearing a ballet outfit and has a serious expression. She's in a dynamic pose.\n>\n> The scene is set in a concert hall. The composition is a close up that frames her head down to her knees. The scene is lit dramatically, with dark shadows and a single shaft of light illuminating the woman from above.\n\n**The rat on the fence post**\n\n> A close up shot of a large, brown rat eating a berry. The rat is on a rickety wooden fence post. The background is an open farm field.\n\n**The woman in the water**\n\n> A surreal shot of a beautiful woman suspended half in water and half in air. She has a dynamic pose, her eyes are closed, and the shot is full body. The shot is split diagonally down the middle, with the lower-left being under water and the upper-right being in air. The air side is bright and cloudy, while the water side is dark and menacing.\n\n**The space capsule**\n\n> A woman is floating in a space capsule. She's wearing a white singlet and white panties. She's off-center, with the camera focused on a window with an external view of earth from space. The interior of the space capsule is dark.\n\n## Upscaling\n\nZ-image makes very sharp images, which means you can directly upscale them very easily. Conventional upscale models rely on sharp/clear images to add detail, so you can't reliably use them on a model that doesn't make sharp images.\n\nMy favourite upscaler for NAKED PEOPLE or human face close-ups is [4xFaceUp](https://huggingface.co/Phips/4xFaceUpDAT). It's ridiculously good at skin detail, but has a tendency to make everything else look a bit stringy (for lack of a better word). Use it when a human being showing lots of skin is the main focus of the shot.\n\nHere's a **6720x6720** version of the sitting bikini girl that was upscaled directly using the 4xFaceUp upscaler: [imgbb](https://ibb.co/ks2LRnxT) | [g-drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10w6DXuHM0j2RivN4hRwKq-jPicyjg-27/view?usp=sharing)\n\nFor general upscaling you can use something like [4xNomos2](https://openmodeldb.info/models/4x-Nomos2-hq-dat2).\n\nAlternatively, you can use [SeedVR2](https://github.com/numz/ComfyUI-SeedVR2_VideoUpscaler), which also has the benefit of working on blurry images (not a problem with z-image anyway). It's not as good at human skin as 4xFaceUp, but it's better at everything else. It's also very reliable and pretty much always works. There's a simple workflow for it here: [https://pastebin.com/9D7sjk3z](https://pastebin.com/9D7sjk3z)\n\n## ClownShark sampler - what is it?\n\nIt's a node from the RES4LYF pack. It works the same as a normal sampler, but with two differences:\n\n1. **\"ETA\"**. This setting basically adds extra noise during sampling using fancy math, and it generally helps get a little bit more detail out of generations. A value of 0.5 is usually good, but I've seen it be good up to 0.7 for certain models (like Klein 9B).\n2. **\"bongmath\"**. This setting turns on bongmath. It's some kind black magic that improves sampling results without any downsides. On some models it makes a big difference, others not so much. I find it does improve z-image outputs. Someone tries to explain what it is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l5uh4d/someone\\_needs\\_to\\_explain\\_bongmath/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1l5uh4d/someone_needs_to_explain_bongmath/)\n\nYou don't need to use this sampler if you don't want to; you can use the res\\_2s/beta sampler/scheduler with a normal ksampler node as long as you have RES4LYF installed. But seeing as the clownshark sampler comes with RES4LYF anyway we may as well use it.\n\n## Effect of CFG on outputs\n\nLower than 4 CFG is bad. Other than that, going higher has pretty big and unpredictable effects on the output for z-image base. You can usually range from 4 to 7 without destroying your image. It doesn't seem to affect prompt adherence much.\n\nGoing higher than 4 will change the lighting, composition and style of images somewhat unpredictably, so it can be helpful to do if you just want to see different variations on a concept. You'll find that some stuff just works better at 5, 6 or 7. Play around with it, but stick with 4 when you're just messing around.\n\nGoing higher than 4 also helps the model adhere to realism sometimes, which is handy if you're doing something realism-adjacent like trying to make a shot of a realistic elf or something.\n\n## Base vs Distil vs Turbo\n\nThey're good for different things. I'm generally a fan of base models, so most workflows I post are / will be for base models. Generally they give the highest quality but are much slower and can be finicky to use at times.\n\n**What is distillation?**\n\nIt's basically a method of narrowing the focus of a model so that it converges on what you want faster and more consistently. This allows a distil to generate images in fewer steps and more consistently for whatever subject/topic was chosen. They often also come pre-negatived (in a sense, don't @ me) so that you can use 1.0 CFG and no negative prompt. **Distils can be full models or simple loras.**\n\nThe downside of this is that the model becomes more narrow, making it less creative and less capable outside of the areas it was focused on during distillation. For many models it also reduces the quality of image outputs, sometimes massively. Models like Qwen and Flux have god-awful quality when distilled (especially human skin), but luckily Z-image distils pretty well and only loses a little bit of quality. **Generally, the fewer steps the distil needs the lower the quality is.** 4-step distils usually have very poor quality compared to base, while 8+ step distils are usually much more balanced.\n\n**Z-image turbo** is just an official distil, and it's focused on general realism and human-centric shots. It's also designed to run in around 10 steps, allowing it to maintain pretty high quality.\n\nSo, if you're just doing human-centric shots and don't mind a small quality drop, Z-image turbo will work just fine for you. You'll want to use a different workflow though - let me know if you'd like me to upload mine.\n\nBelow are the typical pros and cons of base models and distils. These are pretty much always true, but not always a 'big deal' depending on the model. As I said above, Z-image distils pretty well so it's not too bad, but be careful which one you use - tons of distils are terrible at human skin and make people look plastic (z-image turbo is fine).\n\n**Base model pros:**\n\n* Generally gives the highest quality outputs with the finest details, once you get the hang of it\n* Creative and flexible\n\n**Base model cons:**\n\n* Very slow\n* Usually requires a lengthy negative prompt to get good results\n* Creativity has a downside; you'll often need to generate something several times to get a result you like\n* More prone to mistakes when compared to the focus areas of distils\n   * e.g. z-image base is more likely to mess up hands/fingers or distant faces compared to z-image turbo\n\n**Distil pros:**\n\n* Fast generations\n* Good at whatever it was focused on (e.g. people-centric photography for z-image turbo)\n* Doesn't need a negative prompt (usually)\n\n**Distil cons:**\n\n* Bad at whatever it wasn't focused on, compared to base\n* Usually bad at facial expressions (not able to do 'extreme' ones like anger properly)\n* Generally less creative, less flexible (not always a downside)\n* Lower quality images, sometimes by a lot and sometimes only by a little - depends on the model, the specific distil, and the subject matter\n* Can't have a negative prompt (usually)\n   * You can get access to negative prompts using NAG (not covered in this post)",

That's really handy for making images look realistic if the model can't handle full realism, and it's also a legit personal preference for style as well.\n\nThis workflow is aiming for clear, clean photo-real images. So, by default it won't do what you're looking for. However, you can prompt it in by using terms like \"grainy\" or \"low resolution\" and you could also adjust the sampler settings to get it.\n\nI haven't tested for it specifically, but you could try swapping out the second-stage sampler from res\\_2s to something like res\\_2m or dpm++ which are much noisier. Or switch the scheduler to bong\\_tangent which is super noisy. Those will probably get closer to what you're looking for!\n\nActually you may just want to delete the second-stage sampler entirely and try 40 steps of something like dpm++/normal, euler/bong\\_tangent or euler/beta57. Or 20 steps of res\\_2s/bong\\_tangent. I'm just guessing though, you'll wanna play around with it.",

I'm looking for that ridiculous, absurd, \"where did it even go?\" effect. \n\nI almost always use Dreamlay general NSFW lora, but that doesn't seem to make it happen, have also tried experimental NSFW lora but still nope plus face morphing. I've tried POV missionary and POV missionary insertion, but still no consistency. \n\nHere's an example of a prompt I've tried which is basically some phrases I stole from sample vids on Civitai that looked promising, image is typically a high angle view from over a man's shoulder looking down on the woman, both nude, her legs spread, he's already inserted or an inch away. Again, photo realistic ZIT. \n\n\"\"a woman is laying on her back, spreading her legs wide, he inserts his huge penis into the woman's vagina, forcefully thrusting his penis deeply into the woman's vagina back and forth, balls deep penetration, all the way in, piston fucking the woman, the woman moans in pleasure, the huge penis is fully penetrating the vagina over and over.\"\n\nPlease someone show me the way to convince the dude in my gens to just go for it, man.",
