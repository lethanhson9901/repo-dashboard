Usually that requires me passing sage attention arg during launch, but your node pack has made it the default overall in my environment?\n\nEdit: Sigh, does anyone know how to fix this. Disabling the node packs or Uninstaller it does not revert the changes. Passing global flash attention does not help. Forcefully removing Env manager, as is does not show up in installed node packs, does not fix. Sigh, am I gonna have to remake my environment and reset my custom node installations?\n\nEdit2: Remove all the custom nodes that were installed by the update along with the sam3 node pack. Go to the venv and uninstall comfy-env. Use find command to remove any traces of comfy-env. Then remove your main.py and pull a fresh one from github. Thats how to fix it.",

Automate the process with  fixed camera rotations based on optimal gaussian splat POV distribution for each step -> high quality gaussian splat?",

Thanks, that's a great question:\n\nSo there are a couple ways to do it, I haven't tested it yet but Andrea Pozzetti did release a great node for ComfyUI doing just that:\n[ComfyUI-MotionCapture](https://github.com/PozzettiAndrea/ComfyUI-MotionCapture)\n\nOther online solutions exist such as: [Rokoko](https://www.rokoko.com/products/video) and [Deepmotion](https://www.deepmotion.com/)\n\nFinally for another direction also directly inside ComfyUI, you can go the route of prompt-to-3D animation with [HY-MOTION](https://github.com/jtydhr88/ComfyUI-HY-Motion1) which also have an option to save FBX animations compatible with Mixamo.\n\nI hope these will help you :)\n\n\nAs a bonus, (if you want to go experimental!) I designed a suite of nodes for MoCap directly inside ComfyUI, which exports 3D data using mediapipe as a json file, you'd need to go through some process to get some conversion going and redirect that 3D data to a 3D rig.\nOr you can experiment with my MoCap nodes to directly use the output (openpose skeleton), here's the link in case : \n[ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap](https://github.com/yedp123/ComfyUI-Yedp-Mocap)",

Gonna see how it performs vs the A100, cost is  basically the same at 8.x units per hour, curious to see if there's much difference in gen times. Quick tests on mage gen in A1111 is always pretty quick but seems faster with this, so i'm definitely hopeful about wan on comfy. \n\nI've been seeing the H100 available for a couple months now, but every time i try to use it, it's not available so kicks me down to another GPU when I try. I keep trying at odd hours, over the weekend etc but same results. I'm guessing it's not just an option since you get bumped to the back of the line unless you're on Colab Pro+ (priority access to more powerful premuim GPU's hell yeah), so I'll upgrade and try. I've been on Pro at $9/mo using pay as you go to buy extra units as I need them, but at this point I'm always buying at least 500 more per month so the upgrade to the $50/mo plan with 600 units included makes sense. I've been using A100 since they became available last year, only thing that made playing with video gen even tolerable for me. Stoked to see what H100 can do, even at double+ the cost.\n\nAnd for those asking the question about rent vs buy; yes i've been saying for a long time that it's better to rent at $.80/hr than spend 5-6K on a gpu that's outdated in a couple years unless you have a solid business case for doing so; as in you're genning professionally for actual money, running 10+ hours a day, can write off your system as a business expense, etc. As a hobby user I usually go through $75-100 worth of units monthly genning a fair amount of \"content\" in my spare time on an A100 at \\~$.80/hr. Where's the breakeven  on that vs buying your own, plus a system that can run it? Yeah sure there's a point where the math makes sense but until genning content is actually what makes you money and genning *more* content makes you *more* money, i just can't see it.",

If models have to DL every time that'll change a lot, obviously. Probly depends on the kind of service you're using and if persistent storage is available, cost etc. \n\n  \nMy early comfy configs used to take a long time to load, but after I had to wipe my install at one point and clear out the cruft - all the nodes I was initially experimenting with, all the packages they required, etc, it made a HUGE difference. Blank out the pip install line and only add back in the stuff I need now, and spinup and load that used to take \\~45 minutes from run button to first gen now takes less than 20. Now if I had to do this multiple times per day or something maybe I'd wonder how efficient it is. But doing it once to gen for a couple hours in my spare time, it's not enough to make me sweat at 80 cents an hour. \n\nRising costs would change the math, yeah. The rule still applies though I think. And I haven't seen costs go up on Colab, jsut my desire for more speed. That's all that ends up costing me more. G4 from A100 is a no brainer for me. H100, I really gotta think about. Gonna be awesome to have the option for sure, but at over double the cost. My primary question as always: How many margaritas per month will this cost me?",

I just stumbled on this last night and will work in many ways to solve basic cases.  You can even do face replacement.\n\nInstead of creating using and creating a mask and a typical inpainting workflow, instead open the mask tool and use the PAINTBRUSH, select a color like RED, and if you have multiple things use different colors.  Then just tell Qwen to \"Replace red area with face from image 2\" or \"Place coffee cup on table in red area\".\n\nSure, if you have more complex needs for masking, blur, etc... then inpainting is the way to go, but this little hack actually solves a lot of basic inpainting type work.

      "text": "I'm trying to create a green screen effect from a 1080p 60fps video using the **ComfyUI-SAM3** nodes (PozzettiAndrea's version). Since I'm working with a strict **8GB VRAM** limit, I'm downscaling the frames to 856x480 (or 864x480) and processing them in small batches (`frame_load_cap` = 16) to avoid OOM errors.\n\nHere is my current workflow (screenshots attached):\n\n1. **VHS Load Video**: Downscaling the video and limiting the frame count. (I selected 'AnimateDiff' format here just to force the custom width/height options to appear).\n2. **Image Resize**: Making sure the frames are exactly 856x480 before feeding them to SAM3.\n3. **SAM3 Pipeline**: `SAM3 Video Segmentation` (text prompt: \"person\") -> `SAM3 Propagate` \\-> `SAM3 Video Output`.\n4. **Compositing**: I used an `Image Composite Masked` node.\n   * Destination: A solid green image (856x480).\n   * Image (Source): The resized original video frames.\n   * Mask: The `masks` output from SAM3 Video Output.\n\n**The Problem:** My final output from the `Video Combine` node is just a completely 100% solid green screen. The masked person is not showing up at all.\n\nIt seems like either SAM3 is outputting a completely blank/black mask, or my composite node is set up wrong. I've checked the connections multiple times.\n\nDoes anyone see what I'm doing wrong in the attached screenshots? Any advice for a low-VRAM SAM3 setup would be hugely appreciated!

      "text": "I’ve been doing some serious research and testing over the past few weeks, and I’ve finally distilled the \"chaos\" into a repeatable strategy.\n\nWhether you’re a filmmaker or just messing around with digital art, understanding how LTX-2 handles motion and timing is key. I've put together this guide based on my findings—covering everything from 5s micro-shots to full 20s mini-narratives. Here’s what I’ve learned.\n\n**Core Principles of LTX-2**\n\nThe core idea behind LTX-2 prompting is simple but crucial: you need to describe a complete, natural, start-to-finish visual story. It’s not about listing visual elements. It’s about describing a continuous event that unfolds over time.\n\nThink of your prompt like a mini screenplay. Every action should flow naturally into the next. Every camera movement should have intention. Every element should serve the overall pacing and narrative rhythm.\n\nLTX-2 reads prompts the way a cinematographer reads a director’s notes. It responds best to descriptions that clearly define:\n\n* Camera movement: how the camera moves, what it focuses on, how the framing evolves\n* Temporal flow: the order of actions and their pacing\n* Atmospheric detail: lighting, color, texture, and emotional tone\n* Physical precision: accurate descriptions of motion, gestures, and spatial relationships\n\nWhen you approach prompts this way, you’re not just generating a clip. You’re directing a scene.\n\n**Core Elements**\n\n**Shot Setup-Start by defining the opening framing and camera position using cinematic language that fits the genre.**\n\n**Examples**\n\nA high altitude wide aerial shot of a plane\n\nAn extreme close up of the wing details\n\nA top down view of a city at night\n\nA low angle shot looking up at a rocket launch\n\n**Pro tip**\n\nMatch your camera language to the style. Documentary scenes work well with handheld descriptions and subtle shake. More cinematic scenes benefit from smooth movements like a slow dolly push or a controlled crane lift.\n\n**Scene Design-When describing the environment, focus on lighting, color palette, texture, and overall atmosphere.**\n\n**Key elements**\n\n**Lighting**\n\nPolar cold white light\n\nNeon gradient glow\n\nHarsh desert noon sunlight\n\n**Color palette**\n\nCyberpunk purple and teal contrast\n\nEarthy ochre and deep moss green\n\nHigh contrast black and white\n\n**Atmosphere**\n\nTurbulent clouds at high altitude\n\nCold mist beneath the aurora\n\nDiffused light within a sandstorm\n\n**Texture**\n\nMatte metal shell\n\nFrozen lake surface\n\nRough volcanic rock\n\n**Example**\n\nA futuristic airport in heavy rain. Cold blue ground lights trace the runway. Lightning tears across the edges of dark storm clouds. The surface reflects like wet carbon fiber under the storm.\n\n**Action Description-Use present tense verbs and describe actions in a clear sequence.**\n\n**Best practices**\n\n**Use present tense**\n\nTakes off, dives, unfolds, rotates\n\n**Write actions in order**\n\nThe aircraft gains altitude, breaks through the clouds, and stabilizes into level flight\n\n**Add subtle detail**\n\nThe tail fin makes slight directional adjustments\n\n**Show cause and effect**\n\nThe cabin door opens and a rush of air bursts inward\n\n**Weak example**\n\nThe pilot is calm\n\n**Strong example**\n\nThe pilot’s gaze stays locked forward. His fingers make steady adjustments on the control stick. He leans slightly into the motion, maintaining control through the turbulence.\n\n**Character Design-Define characters through appearance, wardrobe, posture, and physical detail. Let emotion show through action.**\n\n**Appearance**\n\nA man in his twenties with short, sharp hair\n\n**Clothing**\n\nAn orange flight suit with windproof goggles\n\n**Posture**\n\nUpright stance, focused eyes\n\n**Emotion through action**\n\nBack straight, gestures controlled and deliberate\n\n**Tip**\n\nAvoid abstract words like nervous or confident. Instead of saying he is nervous, write his palms are slightly damp, his fingers tighten briefly, his breathing slows as he steadies himself.\n\n**Camera Movement-Be specific about how the camera moves, when it moves, and what effect it creates.**\n\n**Common movements**\n\n**Static**\n\nTripod locked off, frame completely stable\n\n**Pan**\n\nSlowly pans right following the aircraft\n\nQuick sweep across the skyline\n\n**Tilt**\n\nTilts upward toward the stars\n\nTilts down to the runway\n\n**Push and pull**\n\nPushes forward tracking the aircraft\n\nGradually pulls back to reveal the full landscape\n\n**Tracking**\n\nMoves alongside from the side\n\nFollows closely from behind\n\n**Crane and vertical movement**\n\nRises to reveal the entire area\n\nDescends slowly from high above\n\n**Advanced tip**\n\nTie camera movement directly to the action. As the aircraft dives, the camera tracks with it. At the moment it pulls up, the camera stabilizes and hovers in place.\n\n**Audio Description-Clearly define environmental sounds, sound effects, music, dialogue, and vocal characteristics.**\n\n**Audio elements**\n\n**Ambient sound**\n\nEngine roar\n\nWind rushing past\n\nRadar beeping\n\n**Sound effects**\n\nMechanical clank as the landing gear deploys\n\nA sharp burst as the aircraft breaks through clouds\n\n**Music**\n\nEpic orchestral score\n\nCold minimal electronic tones\n\nTense atmospheric drones\n\n**Dialogue**\n\nUse quotation marks for spoken lines\n\nRequesting takeoff clearance, he reports calmly\n\n**Example**\n\nThe roar of the engines fills the airspace. Clear instructions come through the radio. “We’ve reached the designated altitude.” The pilot reports in a steady, controlled voice.\n\n# Prompt Practice\n\n# Single Paragraph Continuous Description\n\nStructure your prompt as one smooth, flowing paragraph. Avoid line breaks, bullet points, or fragmented phrases. This helps LTX-2 better understand temporal continuity and how the scene unfolds over time.\n\n**Weak structure**\n\n  Desert explorer\n\n  Noon\n\n  Heat waves\n\n  Walking steadily\n\n**Stronger structure**\n\nA lone explorer walks through the scorching desert at noon, heat waves rippling across the sand as his boots press into the ground with a soft crunch. The camera follows steadily from behind and slightly to the side, capturing the rhythm of each step. A metal canteen swings gently at his waist, catching and reflecting the harsh sunlight. In the distance, a mirage flickers along the horizon, wavering in the rising heat as he continues forward without slowing down.\n\n# Use Present Tense Verbs\n\nDescribe every action in present tense to clearly convey motion and the passage of time. Present tense keeps the scene alive and unfolding in real time.\n\n**Good examples**\n\nTrekking\n\nEvaporating\n\nFlickering\n\nAscending\n\nAvoid\n\nTreked\n\nIs evaporating\n\nHas flickered\n\nWill ascend\n\n# Be Direct About Camera Behavior\n\nAlways specify the camera’s position, angle, movement, and speed. Don’t assume the model will infer how the scene is framed.\n\n**Vague：** A man in the desert\n\n**Clear：** The camera begins with a low angle shot looking up as a man stands on top of a sand dune, gazing into the distance. The camera slowly pushes forward, focusing on strands of hair blown loose by the wind. His silhouette shimmers slightly through the rising heat waves.\n\n# Use Precise Physical Detail\n\nSmall, measurable movements and specific gestures make interactions feel real.\n\n**Generic：** He looks exhausted\n\n**Precise：** His shoulders drop slightly, his knees bend just a little, and his breathing turns shallow and uneven. With each step, he reaches out to brace himself against the rock wall before continuing forward.\n\n# Build Atmosphere Through Sensory Detail\n\nUse lighting, sound, texture, and environmental cues to shape mood.\n\n**Lighting examples：**\n\n* Cold neon tubes cast warped blue and violet reflections across the rain soaked street\n* Colored light filters through stained glass windows, scattering fractured shapes across the church floor\n* A stage spotlight locks onto center frame, leaving everything else swallowed in deep shadow\n\n**Atmosphere examples：**\n\n* Fine rain slants through the air, forming a delicate curtain that glows beneath the streetlights\n* The subtle grinding of metal gears echoes repeatedly through an empty factory hall\n* Ocean wind carries a salty chill, pushing grains of sand slowly across the beach\n\n**Use Temporal Connectors for Flow**\n\nConnective words help actions transition naturally and reinforce a sense of time passing. Words like when, then, as, before, after, while keep the sequence clear.\n\n**Example：**\n\nA heavy metal hatch slides open along the corridor of a space station, and cold mist spills out from the vents. As the camera holds a steady wide shot, a figure in a spacesuit steps forward through the fog. Then the camera tracks sideways, following the figure as they move steadily down the illuminated alloy corridor.\n\n# Advanced Practice\n\n# The Six Part Structured Prompt for 4K Video\n\nIf you’re aiming for the best possible 4K output, it helps to structure your prompt in a clear, layered format like this.\n\n1. **Scene Anchor** Define the location, time of day, and overall atmosphere.\n\n**Example**\n\nAn abandoned rocket launch site at dusk, orange red sunset clouds stretching across the sky, rusted metal structures towering in silence\n\n1. **Subject and Action** Specify who or what is present, paired with a strong verb.\n\n**Example**\n\nA silver drone skims low over the ground, its mechanical arms unfolding slowly as it scans the scattered debris\n\n1. **Camera and Lens** Describe movement, focal length, aperture, and framing.\n\n**Example**\n\nFast forward tracking shot, 24mm lens, f1.8, ultra wide angle, stabilized handheld rig\n\n1. **Visual Style** Define color science, grading approach, or film emulation.\n\n**Example**\n\nHigh contrast image, cool blue green grading, Fujifilm Provia 100F film texture\n\n1. **Motion and Time Cues** Indicate speed, frame rate feel, and shutter characteristics.\n\n**Example**\n\nSubtle motion blur, 60fps feel, equivalent to a 1 over 120 shutter\n\n1. **Guardrails** Clearly state what should be avoided.\n\n**Example**\n\nNo distortion, no blown highlights, no AI artifacts\n\nWhen you use this structure, you’re essentially giving LTX-2 a production blueprint instead of a loose description. That clarity often makes the difference between a decent clip and something that genuinely feels cinematic.\n\n# Lens and Shutter Language\n\nUsing specific camera terminology helps control motion continuity and realism, especially when you’re aiming for cinematic consistency.\n\nFocal length examples:\n\n* 24mm wide angle creates a strong sense of space and environmental scale\n* 50mm standard lens gives a natural, human eye perspective\n* 85mm portrait lens adds compression and intimacy\n* 200mm telephoto compresses depth and isolates the subject from the background\n\nShutter descriptions:\n\n* 180 degree shutter equivalent produces classic cinematic motion blur\n* Natural motion blur enhances realism in moving subjects\n* Fast shutter with crisp motion creates a sharp, high energy action feel\n\n# Keywords for Smooth 50 FPS Motion\n\nIf you’re targeting fluid movement at 50fps, the language you use really matters.\n\nCamera stability:\n\n* Stable dolly push\n* Smooth gimbal stabilization\n* Tripod locked off\n* Constant speed pan\n\nMotion quality:\n\n* Natural motion blur\n* Fluid movement\n* Controlled motion\n* Stable tracking\n\nAvoid at 50fps:\n\n* Chaotic handheld movement, which often introduces warping\n* Shaky camera\n* Irregular motion\n\n# Pro Tip: Long Take Prompting Strategy (for that 20s max duration)\n\nIf you're pushing for those 20-second clips, stop thinking in terms of single prompts and start treating them like **mini-scenes**. Here’s the structure I’ve been using to keep the AI from hallucinating or losing the plot:\n\n**The Framework:**\n\n* **Scene Heading:** Location and Time of Day (Keep it specific).\n* **Brief Description:** The overall vibe and atmosphere you’re aiming for.\n* **Blocking:** The sequence of the subject's actions and camera movements. This is the \"meat\" of the long take.\n* **Dialogue/Cues:** Any specific performance notes (wrapped in parentheses).\n\n**Check out this 15s Long Take prompt structure.**\n\n`Blocking:` `Start with a` `macro shot` `of a pilot’s gloved hand brushing against a flight stick; metallic reflections catch the dying sunlight. As he pushes the throttle forward, the camera` `slowly pulls back` `into a medium shot, revealing his clenched jaw and the cold glow of the cockpit dashboard. His expression shifts from pure focus to a hint of grim determination. The camera` `continues to dolly back\\`\\`, eventually revealing the entire tarmac behind him—rusted fighter jets, scattered debris, and a sky bled orange-red by the sunset.`\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1rf7byp/video/8brzyhfpmtlg1/player\n\n# AV Sync Techniques for LTX-2\n\nSince LTX-2 generates audio and video simultaneously, you can use these specific prompting techniques to tighten up the synchronization:\n\n**Temporal Cueing：**\n\n* **\"On the heavy drum beat\"** – Perfectly aligns action with the musical rhythm.\n* **\"On the third bass hit\"** – For precise timing of a specific event.\n* **\"Laser beam fires at the 3-second mark\"** – Use timestamps to specify exact moments.\n\n**Action Regularity：**\n\n* **\"Constant speed tracking shot\"** – Keeps camera movement predictable for the AI.\n* **\"Rhythmic robotic arm oscillation\"** – Creates movements at regular intervals.\n* **\"Steady heartbeat pulse\"** – Maintains a consistent audio-visual pattern.\n\n**Prompt Example:**\n\n\"A robotic arm precisely grabs a component on the bass hit, its metallic pincers opening and closing in a perfect rhythm. The camera remains steady in a close-up, while each grab produces a crisp metallic clank that echoes through the sterile, dust-free lab.\"\n\n**Core Competencies & Strengths**\n\n|Core Domain|Key Strengths & Performance|\n|:-|:-|\n||\n|**Cinematic Composition**|Controlled camera movement (Dolly, Crane, Tracking); clearly defined depth of field; mastery of classic cinematography and genre-specific framing.|\n|**Emotional Character Moments**|Subtle facial expressions; natural body language; authentic emotional responses and nuanced character interactions.|\n|**Atmospheric Scenes**|Environmental storytelling; weather effects (fog, rain, snow); mood-driven lighting and high-texture environments.|\n|**Clear Visual Language**|Defined shot types; purposeful movement; consistent framing and professional-grade technical execution.|\n|**Stylized Aesthetics**|Film stock emulation; professional color grading; genre-specific VFX and artistic post-processing.|\n|**Precise Lighting Control**|Motivated light sources; dramatic shadowing; accurate color temperature and light quality rendering.|\n|**Multilingual Dubbing/Audio**|Natural dialogue delivery; accent-specific specs; diverse voice characterization with multi-language support.|\n\n**Showcase Example 1: Nature Scene – Rainforest Expedition**\n\n**Prompt:** \n\nAn explorer treks through a dense rainforest before a storm, the dry leaves crunching underfoot. The camera glides in a low-angle slow tracking shot from the side-rear, following his steady pace. His headlamp casts a cold white beam that flickers against damp foliage, while massive vines sway gently in the overhead canopy. Distant primate calls echo through the humid air as a fine mist begins to fall, beading on his waterproof jacket. His trekking pole jabs rhythmically into the humus, each strike leaving a distinct imprint in the mud.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1rf7byp/video/5uce18lrmtlg1/player\n\n**Why This Prompt Works:**\n\n* **Precise Camera Movement:** Using \"low-angle slow tracking shot from the side-rear\" gives the AI a clear vector for motion.\n* **Temporal Progression:** The action naturally evolves from walking to the first drops of rain, creating a logical timeline.\n* **Atmospheric Layering:** Captures the pre-storm humidity, dense vegetation, and the specific texture of mist.\n* **Audio Integration:** Combines foley (crunching leaves), ambient nature (primate calls), and weather (rain sounds) for a full soundscape.\n* **Physics Accuracy:** Detailed interactions like the trekking pole sinking into humus and water beading on fabric ground the scene in reality.\n\n**Showcase Example 2: Character Close-up – Archeological Site**\n\n**Prompt:** \n\nAn archeologist kneels in a desert excavation pit under the harsh midday sun, meticulously cleaning an artifact. The camera starts in a medium close-up at knee height, then slowly dollies forward to focus on his hands. His right hand grips a brush while his left gently steadies the edge of a pottery shard. As a distant shout from a teammate echoes, his fingers tighten slightly, and the brush pauses mid-air. The camera remains steady with a shallow depth of field, capturing the focus in his wrists against the blurred, silent silhouette of a pyramid peak in the background. Ambient Audio: The howl of wind-blown sand and distant camel bells create an ancient, solemn atmosphere.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1rf7byp/video/p9oirkvsmtlg1/player\n\n**Why This Prompt Works:**\n\n* **Specific Camera Progression:** The transition from \"medium close-up to close-up dolly\" gives the shot a professional, intentional feel.\n* **Precise Physical Details:** Specific hand positioning, the tightening of fingers, and the brush pausing mid-air ground the AI in physical reality.\n* **Emotional Beats through Action:** Using the reaction to a distant shout and the momentary pause to convey focus and narrative tension.\n* **Depth of Field Specs:** Explicitly using \"shallow depth of field\" to force the focus onto the intricate textures of the artifact and hands.\n* **Atmospheric Audio:** The howl of wind and camel bells instantly build a world beyond the frame.\n\n# Short-Form Video Strategy (Under 5s)\n\nFor short clips, less is more. You want to focus on a **single, high-impact movement** or a fleeting moment, stripping away any elements that might distract from the core message.\n\n**The Structure:**\n\n* **One Clear Action:** No subplots or secondary movements.\n* **Simple Camera Work:** Either a static shot or a very basic pan/zoom.\n* **Minimal Scene Complexity:** Keep the background clean to avoid hallucinations.\n\n**Short-Form Example:**\n\n**Prompt:** A silver coin is flicked from a thumb, flipping rapidly through the air before landing precisely back in a palm. **Close-up, shallow depth of field**, with crisp, cold metallic reflections.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1rf7byp/video/kuui3j4vmtlg1/player\n\n**Mid-Form Video Strategy (5–10 Seconds)**\n\nAt this duration, you want to develop a **short sequence** with a clear beginning, middle, and end. Think of it as a micro-narrative with a distinct \"arc.\"\n\n**The Structure:**\n\n* **2–3 Connected Actions:** A logical progression of movement.\n* **One Fluid Camera Motion:** Avoid jerky cuts; stick to one consistent path.\n* **Clear Progression:** A sense of moving from one state to another.\n\n**Mid-Form Example:**\n\n**Prompt:** \n\nAn astronaut reaches out to touch the viewport, her fingertips gliding across the cold glass as she gazes at the swirling blue planet outside. The camera slowly dollies forward, shifting the focus from her immediate reflection to the vast, shimmering expanse of the cosmos.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1rf7byp/video/n0clt0iwmtlg1/player\n\n",
