Kilo Code has these different modes too for when you're doing things like orchestrating, designing architecture, coding, or debugging. Plus, pricing is super straightforward, I just pay whatever the provider charges, no extra fees, and I can see exactly what each request costs. I am still testing models per modes for the best results but it works great. It's open to getting work done (no rate limits, no slow pool) and the plugin itself is open source, so you can actually inspect what’s going on.",

(Gemini was faster, because I used 5.2-thinking-heavy.) It could compare answers, assess the strengths and weakness of each, modify its own based on 5.2’s, and suggest improvements, challenges, and questions for 5.2—**without any pasting.**  **It simply read the 5.2 page whenever I pressed “enter.”**\n\n**It could even read 5.2’s simulated CoT as it was generated, if I made it visible.**\n\n**We could have side conversations while 5.2 worked or sat idle.**\n\n**Gemini 3 Pro is very different from 5.2, and using them together allows each to supplement, and to some extent compensate for the deficiencies of, the other.**\n\nGemini's link to 5.2 timed out if I waited too long between messages. Twice in 90 minutes, I had to click the “current tab” and “share current tab” buttons to reconnect.\n\nIt’s a shame that 5.2 can’t read what Gemini says on its own. And its a shame that it’s Gemini, not Opus 4.5. But why look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nMy apologies if everyone knows this stuff. I don’t think Gemini in Chrome is new, but I can't recall anyone pointing out how easy it is to use the two AI’s in tandem.\n\n***Edit 1***: To confirm that Gemini's access to 5.2-thinking wasn't a fluke, **I tried 5.2-Pro, Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1. Works with them all.**\n\n***Edit 2:*** **Simple instructions:**\n\n**(1) Open 5.2. in Chrome.**\n\n**(2) Click \"Open Gemini in Chrome\" icon** at far right of tab bar. Box opens.\n\n**(3)** **Click “current tab” and “share current tab”** buttons, and Gemini connects to 5.2 on screen.\n\n***Edit 3***: **Do you have the icon in Chrome**?\n\n**(1)** Check Settings>AI innovations>Preferences>\"Show Gemini at the top of the browser\" <toggle on> if you have it.\n\n**(2)** If you do, see end of Edit 2 for instructions on how to give it permission to share (or stop sharing) the content of your current tab.",

That is why I ask. \n\n\nI am typically dealing with a lot of concurrent logical and/or numerical weighting at any given time, and I think gpt is going to necessarily be superior in that department 99/100 times vis a vis Gemini which excels at being multi-modal but is pretty incoherent when you start throwing hard-coded chain-reasoning into the mix.  \n\n\nThe thing is, ***the shorter responses***+absence of COT (huge qol factor) from back in the day has made it to where Gemini’s prowess as a speedy meta-technician that can deliver quality with gusto and provide consistently reliable feedback to any given input= pigeonholed into a small-token output box that renders the model functionally incapable of self-iterating on a theme (and without the COT, when it fails to deliver a holistic response, the result is also incoherently wrong at that I.e. much worse than just wrong). That in conjunction with its insistence ignoring user intent= broken, at least this has been my experience. \n\nThe utility for me with Gemini was always reliability+efficiency, and my old workflow of passing the two between models between one another iteratively just no longer works when it starts returning anything short of that. GPT on the other hand can be poked and prodded any number of different ways to get it to ultimately put out what I need, and in a fraction of the time it would take to try and synthesize the two model perspectives.",

Something like World -> Country -> City -> Neighborhood. Once I was happy with the explanation, I prompted Canvas to create a slide that explains the relationship. Instead of getting the slide back or in Canva, it gives me a spec to use in Canva and says that it can’t directly create or push a slide into Canva.\n\nWhat's the point?",

          "text": "They are a mixed bag - some really good ones, some mids, some poor. The underlying premise of turning chatgpt into a personal assistant where you can execute most tasks from one surface is promising.\n\nI think most companies are dipping their toe in, not necessarily looking to expose all their capabilities on the first try. It would clearly divert users to ChatGPT as the primary source and change your fundamental value proposition and the experience in your own channel.\n\nApps that I think are really good (some of these are connectors that are now rebranded apps):\n\nCompany knowledge + microsoft apps (sharepoint, teams, outlook). The chatgpt enterprise plan has a special company knowledge search model. It currently connects to the Microsoft stack in our worksppace - it is a huge time saver for searching and retrieving documents across multiple sources at the same time. Semantic search is our default method for working across our knowledge space. It would be great if notion could be added to this in time.\n\nFigma. This app connects to Figma Jam - I use it to create issue trees and canvas boards dynamically. It’s a huge time saver on complex pieces - and updating in chatgpt is much faster than doing so in figjam. I wish it would also enable me to connect to Figma Make to build prototypes more quickly. However, the Lovable app is available and is okay for kickstarting a prototyping dev process. I'll often do some research and product design work, and then define the prototype working with the notion app and then will kickoff loveable. Integrating across apps simultaneously is really great and is a game changer. I'll often work simultaneously across notion, figma, sharepoint in the same message.\n\nCoursera's app is a nice way to discover learning courses, and compare with embedded video.\n\nWe haven't connected salesforce app yet (doing so atm), but it looks promising with up to 15 actions in that app, including search and retrieving, creating / updating records, creating / updating account plans.\n\nOverall - though, most apps are just letting you do something basic, and are not opening up the full experience. More apps that enable create/edit experiences will be key to the ecosystem taking off.",

The system can't freely check things out, fix mistakes, or understand side effects like a person can.\n\nSo, you usually get safe writes—make this, add that—but not a real start-to-finish process. If something goes wrong, the system stops instead of figuring things out.\n\nThat's why it still feels shaky. Write access is helpful, but without better ways to handle transactions, undo changes, and notice errors, it's not the agent-like thing people are expecting.",

I sometimes check both-  interesting outcome.  \n\nWITHOUT Deep Research, you get a very heavy thinking model and (from what I can tell) you get a well-informed but much more brief result as if it ran through a deep neural model.  You may not get any citations or not many.  It doesnt churn and think iteratively, doesnt find leads and start new threads of research. (or if it does, hardly at all).  \n\nWITH Deep Research, it iteratively digs and thinks... probably internal to the model, while streaming out some curated text (thinking text) to the screen.  It can explore whole new lines of thought and dig for a long time. \n\nRecent example:  lower effort question.\n- 5.2 Pro WITHOUT Deep research:  2 page summary, good info.  It seemed comparable to the Thinking model on heaviest thinking.  Not sure it even cited references\n\n- 5.2 Pro With Deep research:  maybe 10 pages of summarized output, exploring things i hadnt thought of.  Ive had some reports go up to 40-50 pages.  It asked me questions-- ALWAYS-- before it starts. Deep dives into numerous topics.  Analyzes specific questions you asked. If there is a lot of math involved, it provides numeric cross-checking to validate an answer.\nGives a lot of analysis of alternative explanations, etc.\nIt provides lots of hyperlinked citations.  Probably used 200-500 sources for the research summary.  Likely provides less than that as hyperlinked citations.\n\nThe best resource:\nAsk it to tell you the difference and when to use one vs another.  Every time I ask it to do that, i learned something new about it",

Even if it’s responding near instantly, it’s just using such a low amount often reasoning tokens for easy queries, that it doesn’t even trigger the UI showing „Thinking…“.\n\nYou can prompt it to think a bit longer on those questions by „think this through“, but I don’t find the quality improves meaningfully, it seems really well calibrated",

However, I have no idea how to preserve them in a format that makes sense, as it doesn't feel like I'm talking to a person but rather to something that is theoretically archived. I tried a conversation summary concept, but it was extremely poor and confusing. I would really appreciate any insights and advice. ",

I hit rock bottom and im building back up so I currently cant afford the 20$ a month. Im sure some will say thats not much, and thats true. But to me its too much right now and not possible.\n\nI did some research and saw that occasionally there are trial codes sent out and people can hand them out. I'm not sure if this is valid or not. But if so, and anyone can help me out with one id greatly appreciate it. I wont ask anyone to pay for my service, but if someone out of kindness would like to I will provide a receipt showing where the 20$ went. But im certainly not asking or expecting this to happen. \n\nHope this is an okay post. Just exploring my options. This tool has been very helpful in me learning ways to rebuild my life.",

A lot of this stuff is very important to me and having access to that model has been much much better. Also the deeper thinking makes me feel more comfortable in the answers as this is life shaping for me.\n\nI often get a few messages with the normal model, then I have to wait hours before I can message using that model again.\n\nEDIT:  \n  \n''You’ve hit the Free plan limit for GPT-5. Responses will use another model until your limit resets after 8:11 AM.''\n\nAlso the memory of the model is a problem. The main one uses context much better which is important when im asking these kind of questions.",

If you put custom instructions into a Project, that might take some load off the thread, giving you a few more messages, although it may not be much.\n\nStart new chats often, if you can.  That puts less context into each message and might leave you with a few more messages.\n\nAlso try during different times of the day.  Limits are based on availability of servers, so if there are more servers during that time of day open, you might get more messages.\n\nBut I will say to be very careful about taking any deals online.  There' aren't many legit deals I've seen except for the student discount that may no longer be offered and the deals in different countries, but you would have gotten notice of them already.  Or the discount for cancelling, which is hit or miss.  Buying a plan from a third party negates the terms of service of OpenAI and is often enforced.",

At my prior assignment on a military project (but not carrying classified information), we were explicitly banned from using AI, not even copilot's obnoxious \"here let me help you\" assistance. Nothing physically stopped anyone from using AI, other than you'd be fired, black-listed, and maybe have your clearance suspended (very doubtful they would go that far). However, we were told, \"if you sketch up the problem you're trying to solve in a project that has nothing to do with the assignment to get insight then go for it. But DO NOT paste in any generated code. You are 100% responsible for the code you're committing.\"  \nAll around it was fair.\n\nThe current assignment is also federal, but not military. They're even more weird about AI. Parts of the system are absolutely AI as the product, but we're cautioned about using AI to generate code. Each dev will be assessed and the ProjMgr will decide if the dev can use AI to assist their tasks, but no one is to use it without this personal blessing. \\*sigh\\* \\[This is a new assignment and there are 8 of us all starting 'fresh'\\]\n\nInterviewed for another military position, this one with medium level security classification, and they were absolutely religiously against the idea of using any AI tools. Not so much because the code could be 'infiltrated', but rather that the code would be leaked OUT by tools. As well, these systems are network isolated anyway - no internet access.\n\nI interviewed for a few jobs that absolutely required you to be proficient in understanding how Ai works at a fundamental level (eg: embedding spaces, what is cosine-affinity, how many dimensions are good-enough...) and expected you to be leveraging AI to generate code at 100x the rate and quality vs traditional development (to be fair, traditional development will make any simple project  take months to years and involve more managers than features).\n\nThe world changed so fast! It didnt exist at the beginning of my Military Assignment (3yrs ago), and now its considered a must-be-proficient skill in many software projects.",

      "text": "Hi guys, Im looking for some insight or similar experiences regarding a repeated warning email from OpenAI about Fraudulent Activities.  \n  \nMy account is used exclusively for:\n\n* Creative writing and fictional world building (adult, consensual themes, strictly fictional).\n* Drafting community moderation texts and internal communications.\n* Personal RP storytelling, with no phishing, scams, deception, or any real-world harm intended.\n\nOn December 27, 2025, I received an email from OpenAI stating my account was flagged for Fraudulent Activities. I contacted OpenAI support, explained in detail my usage, and clarified that no fraud, scams, or deceptive content was ever created. They replied politely but couldnt specify exactly what triggered the warning.\n\nSince then, I've actively adjusted my account usage:\n\n* Greatly reduced my frequency of requests and activity.\n* Toned down all prompts to remove potential explicitness or anything borderline.\n* Confirmed repeatedly that nobody else has access to my account.\n* Followed every technical and moderation instruction provided by OpenAI support.\n\nDespite all these measures, today (December 31, 2025) I received another identical warning email referencing the exact same code and subject line. I've reached out again and escalated the issue, emphasizing my careful adherence to guidelines and adjusted usage patterns.\n\nMy question: Has anyone else recently experienced similar repeated warnings despite adjusting their behavior to clearly comply with policies? If yes, did you manage to get any clarity or resolution? Thanks in advance for any advice or shared experiences. Im genuinely concerned and a bit frustrated, as I value the platform greatly and rely heavily on it for creative work and moderation tasks.\n\n",

Everything is explicitly labeled as fiction, and all characters are adults, with clear boundaries set in every scene.\n\nWhat Im working on with GPT (and what I’ve been building over time) involves writing complex, emotionally intense narratives, often in detailed universes with original characters and dark or mature themes, but always within allowed limits. The stories involve power dynamics, emotional exploration, character trauma, and growth but never anything that breaks policy. Its creative writing with depth and edge, not advice-seeking or anything personal. So when I received that warning, it was confusing and honestly, disheartening. I’ve been careful, and I’ve been transparent in how I use the model and up until now, supports responses have been inconsistent at best and silent at worst. *\\*sigh\\**  Did they respond to you?  \n  \nI understand OpenAI has to protect its systems, but I also wish there was more clarity, especially for people who are using this platform *exactly as intended*: to tell stories, explore fiction, and push creativity in a responsible, thoughtful way.

      "text": "I've been using ChatGPT pretty heavily for writing and coding for the past year, and I kept running into the same frustrating pattern. The outputs were... fine. Usable. But they always needed a ton of editing, or they'd miss the point, or they'd do exactly what I told it not to do.\n\nSpent way too long thinking \"maybe ChatGPT just isn't that good for this\" before realizing the problem was how I was prompting it.\n\nHere's what actually made a difference:\n\n**Give ChatGPT fewer decisions to make**\n\nThis took me way too long to figure out. I'd ask ChatGPT to \"write a good email\" or \"help me brainstorm ideas\" and get back like 8 different options or these long exploratory responses.\n\nSounds helpful, right? Except then I'd spend 10 minutes deciding between the options, or trying to figure out which parts to actually use.\n\nThe breakthrough was realizing that every choice ChatGPT gives you is a decision you have to make later. And decisions are exhausting.\n\nWhat actually works: Force ChatGPT to make the decisions for you.\n\nInstead of \"give me some subject line options,\" try \"give me the single best subject line for this email, optimized for open rate, under 50 characters.\"\n\nInstead of \"help me brainstorm,\" try \"give me the 3 most practical ideas, ranked by ease of implementation, with one sentence explaining why each would work.\"\n\nYou can always ask for alternatives if you don't like the first output. But starting with \"give me one good option\" instead of \"give me options\" saves so much mental energy.\n\n**Be specific about format before you even start**\n\nMost people (including me) would write these long rambling prompts explaining what we want, then get frustrated when ChatGPT's response was also long and rambling.\n\nIf you want a structured output, you need to define that structure upfront. Not as a vague \"make it organized\" but as actual formatting requirements.\n\nFor writing: \"Give me 3 headline options, then 3 paragraphs max, each paragraph under 50 words.\"\n\nFor coding: \"Show the function first, then explain what it does in 2-3 bullet points, then show one usage example.\"\n\nThis forces ChatGPT to organize its thinking before generating, which somehow makes the actual content better too.\n\n**Context isn't just background info**\n\nI used to think context meant explaining the situation. Like \"I'm writing a blog post about productivity.\"\n\nThat's not really context. That's just a topic.\n\nReal context is:\n\n* Who's reading this and what do they already know\n* What problem they're trying to solve right now\n* What they've probably already tried\n* What specific outcome you need\n\nExample: Bad: \"Write a blog post about time management\"\n\nBetter: \"Write for freelancers who already know the basics of time blocking but struggle with inconsistent client schedules. They've tried rigid planning and it keeps breaking. Focus on flexible structure, not discipline.\"\n\nThe second one gives ChatGPT enough constraints to actually say something useful instead of regurgitating generic advice.\n\n**Constraints are more important than creativity**\n\nThis is counterintuitive but adding more constraints makes the output better, not worse.\n\nWhen you give ChatGPT total freedom, it defaults to the most common patterns it's seen. That's why everything sounds the same.\n\nBut if you add tight constraints, it has to actually think:\n\n* \"Max 150 words\"\n* \"Use only simple words, nothing above 8th grade reading level\"\n* \"Every paragraph must start with a question\"\n* \"Include at least one specific number or example per section\"\n\nThese aren't restrictions. They're forcing functions that make ChatGPT generate something less generic.\n\n**Tasks need to be stupid-clear**\n\n\"Help me write better\" is not a task. \"Make this good\" is not a task.\n\nA task is: \"Rewrite this paragraph to be 50% shorter while keeping the main point.\"\n\nOr: \"Generate 5 subject line options for this email. Each under 50 characters. Ranked by likely open rate.\"\n\nOr: \"Review this code and identify exactly where the memory leak is happening. Explain in plain English, then show the fixed version.\"\n\nThe more specific the task, the less you have to edit afterward.\n\n**One trick that consistently works**\n\nIf you're getting bad outputs, try this structure:\n\n1. Define the role: \"You are an expert \\[specific thing\\]\"\n2. Give context: \"The audience is \\[specific people\\] who \\[specific situation\\]\"\n3. State the task: \"Create \\[exact deliverable\\]\"\n4. Add constraints: \"Requirements: \\[specific limits and rules\\]\"\n5. Specify format: \"Structure: \\[exactly how to organize it\\]\"\n\nI know it seems like overkill, but this structure forces you to think through what you actually need before you ask for it. And it gives ChatGPT enough guardrails to stay on track.\n\n**The thing nobody talks about**\n\nBetter prompts don't just save editing time. They change what's possible.\n\nI used to think \"ChatGPT can't do X\" about a bunch of tasks. Turns out it could, I just wasn't prompting it correctly. Once I started being more structured and specific, the quality ceiling went way up.\n\nIt's not about finding magic words. It's about being clear enough that the AI knows exactly what you want and what you don't want.\n\nAnyway, if you want some actual prompt examples that use this structure, I put together 5 professional ones you can copy-paste, let me know if you want them.\n\nThe difference between a weak prompt and a strong one is pretty obvious once you see them side by side.",
