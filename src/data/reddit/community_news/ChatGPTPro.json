(Gemini was faster, because I used 5.2-thinking-heavy.) It could compare answers, assess the strengths and weakness of each, modify its own based on 5.2’s, and suggest improvements, challenges, and questions for 5.2—**without any pasting.**  **It simply read the 5.2 page whenever I pressed “enter.”**\n\n**It could even read 5.2’s simulated CoT as it was generated, if I made it visible.**\n\n**We could have side conversations while 5.2 worked or sat idle.**\n\n**Gemini 3 Pro is very different from 5.2, and using them together allows each to supplement, and to some extent compensate for the deficiencies of, the other.**\n\nGemini's link to 5.2 timed out if I waited too long between messages. Twice in 90 minutes, I had to click the “current tab” and “share current tab” buttons to reconnect.\n\nIt’s a shame that 5.2 can’t read what Gemini says on its own. And its a shame that it’s Gemini, not Opus 4.5. But why look a gift horse in the mouth?\n\nMy apologies if everyone knows this stuff. I don’t think Gemini in Chrome is new, but I can't recall anyone pointing out how easy it is to use the two AI’s in tandem.\n\n***Edit 1***: To confirm that Gemini's access to 5.2-thinking wasn't a fluke, **I tried 5.2-Pro, Opus 4.5, and Grok 4.1. Works with them all.**\n\n***Edit 2:*** **Simple instructions:**\n\n**(1) Open 5.2. in Chrome.**\n\n**(2) Click \"Open Gemini in Chrome\" icon** at far right of tab bar. Box opens.\n\n**(3)** **Click “current tab” and “share current tab”** buttons, and Gemini connects to 5.2 on screen.\n\n***Edit 3***: **Do you have the icon in Chrome**?\n\n**(1)** Check Settings>AI innovations>Preferences>\"Show Gemini at the top of the browser\" <toggle on> if you have it.\n\n**(2)** If you do, see end of Edit 2 for instructions on how to give it permission to share (or stop sharing) the content of your current tab.",

That is why I ask. \n\n\nI am typically dealing with a lot of concurrent logical and/or numerical weighting at any given time, and I think gpt is going to necessarily be superior in that department 99/100 times vis a vis Gemini which excels at being multi-modal but is pretty incoherent when you start throwing hard-coded chain-reasoning into the mix.  \n\n\nThe thing is, ***the shorter responses***+absence of COT (huge qol factor) from back in the day has made it to where Gemini’s prowess as a speedy meta-technician that can deliver quality with gusto and provide consistently reliable feedback to any given input= pigeonholed into a small-token output box that renders the model functionally incapable of self-iterating on a theme (and without the COT, when it fails to deliver a holistic response, the result is also incoherently wrong at that I.e. much worse than just wrong). That in conjunction with its insistence ignoring user intent= broken, at least this has been my experience. \n\nThe utility for me with Gemini was always reliability+efficiency, and my old workflow of passing the two between models between one another iteratively just no longer works when it starts returning anything short of that. GPT on the other hand can be poked and prodded any number of different ways to get it to ultimately put out what I need, and in a fraction of the time it would take to try and synthesize the two model perspectives.",

If they sent out an email for every single change in ChatGPT, your inbox would be filled with emails about things you probably wouldn't care about on a daily basis.  OpenAI makes announcements about new things almost daily on its twitter feed.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1pok213/images_15_launches_today_121625_in_chatgpt_and/\n\nImage 1.5 is more generic, but it's more flexible as well.  You can get the images that were possible before but you can also get images in other styles as well.  You just have to prompt for what you want.\n\nYou can also still access the old Dall-E model.  I just tried it.  I use that a lot when I wanted something faster (although the new image gen is faster).  Go to the GPTs and look for OpenAI's GPTs.  Dall-E is there.  Or just search for Dall-E but only use OpenAI's.  \n\nI like Gemini and Whisk from Google. There are dozens of AI image gen models.  Many are free.  It depends on what you're looking for.\n\nI can't recommend a prompt because I don't know what you're looking to try to create.  If you try asking ChatGPT, and you can describe what you're missing about the old model, it might be able to help you create a prompt that will get what you're looking for.  If it can't help you, come back with a much more specific idea about what you're trying to achieve, and maybe someone can help.",

      "text": "Hey guys, I’ve been tinkering with a small project that I *personally* needed, and I figured it might be useful for other people too.\n\n👉🏻 Here's the link: [https://www.mooon.com.br/ai](https://www.mooon.com.br/ai)\n\nIt’s basically an “AI Enhancer by Guided Customization”: instead of writing custom instructions from scratch (or copying random prompts), you go through a friendly, step-by-step interface with simple choices (cards, toggles, tags). The app collects your answers and generates a ready-to-paste Custom Instructions block you can use in ChatGPT (or any AI that supports instructions).\n\nWhat it asks you (in plain language):\n\n* What topics you live in (with nested themes and subthemes)\n* What roles you want the AI to play (organize, create, reflect, technical help, etc.)\n* Your preferred tone (direct, calm, deep, playful… and custom tags)\n* How you want the AI to behave in sensitive situations\n* What you want it to avoid (AI-ish jargon, generic self-help, forced positivity, etc.)\n* Optional: multiple “modes” you can activate on demand (like archetypes)\n\nAt the end it also recommends a default GPT model *based on your answers* and explains why.\n\nI’m calling this v1.0 and I’m not trying to be grand about it. It’s just a clean way to turn “what I mean” into something an AI can actually follow consistently.\n\nIf anyone here is into UX, prompt design, or just uses AIs a lot: I’d love feedback.\n\n* What feels confusing or unnecessary?\n* What steps would you add/remove?\n* What would make the generated instructions more useful in real life?\n\nIf you want to test it, tell me what platform you use (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini etc.) and what kind of use cases you have, and I can adapt the output formatting later.\n\nThanks ✨",

Pasted the five paragraph prompt into chatgpt then asked it to compare DDR5 RAM versus DDR4 RAM with current price increases if there is any real world performance difference in gaming, docker or video editing. Then I did the same exact question in a new instance of chatgpt 5.2 and included a quick prompt of \"Answer in a technical manner and straight forward.\"  Something I'd just add normally without much thought. \n\nHonestly the single sentence second prompt I did had way better information. Which again leads me to believe that people chasing prompt engineering are wasting their time and chasing clout to pad a resume. You can literally be direct and just ask something and you'll get your answer, likely a better answer than five paragraphs of do this and don't do that.  \n\nEdit: Dang, \"pro\" prompt engineers mad that their entire existence really doesn't change anything. Just adding paragraphs to a question in chatgpt doesn't magically give you a better answer. You just spent more time getting the same information. AI isn't actually intelligence it's going to give you the info you want regardless if you know how to write a sentance.",

      "text": "I’ve worked with ChatGPT in brainstorming contexts and it worked great.  Now, for the first time, I’m trying to do something that requires more continuity through the chat and I must be doing something wrong or have the wrong expectation.\n\nI’ll hone in on the main problem to keep it brief but am happy to elaborate if it’s helpful.\n\nI want to define and document a workflow highlighting places where ChatGPT or AI would be helpful.  \n\nThe brainstorming part goes great.\n\nI now want to create a template with consistent headers to document every part of the workflow in a consistent way.\n\nI’m defining the template based on our elaboration of the first step of what is probably a 6-7 step workflow.\n\nThe problem I’m having is that ChatGPT doesn’t remember something discussed even 2 exchanges before so it’s extremely difficult to iterate.\n\nAs an example, it created a pdf draft of a template and it was fine but I wanted same changes.  I specified the changes, that they should be applied to the first draft, etc.  but when it created the second draft it was as if it forgot what the first draft looked like so, while some of my requested changes were there, the entire template was fundamentally different in both formatting and content.  And each effort at iteration proceeded similarly - it’s all shifting sand.\n\nI tried to be as specific and detailed as possible to no avail, though I was doing so in a “conversational” style, not as structured or formatted “input.”\n\nSince what I’m trying to do (iterate on a concept to completion) seems so basic I feel I must be approaching this incorrectly in some fundamental way.\n\nAny guidance or pointers to online resources would be greatly appreciated! I took a look at the pinned posts but nothing seemed particularly relevant. Thanks in advance!\n\nEdit: forgot to say, I’m on Plus.",

          "text": "The backend model that drives reasoning and generation is static. It has no memory. All it knows is the prompt it just received, and the response it generates. \n\nIt works like this: \nEvery time you send a prompt, a payload is structured which includes that prompt, and other things like long term memories, system prompt, some metadata, etc. most significantly it also sends the entire text of your current chat session. This is how it simulates “memory” and how it maintains continuity. \n\nThis prompt payload is limited by the size of the “context window”, which is the amount of text that can be sent, ingested, and processed by the model. Once the chat session reaches a size where it maxes out the context window, it must be condensed, chopped, or summarized. Usually a combination of these techniques is used. Eventually all significant detail will be summarized out beyond the last couple of turns. \n\nWhen this happens it’s time to start a new chat session. Easiest thing to do is to tell ChatGPT to provide a summary of the current status of whatever you’re working on to carryover to a new chat session. Then copy the provided summary, and paste it into the new chat session, along with whatever deliverables you are going to work from. You get a fresh context window and should have solid continuity for a while until you max it out again.\n\nTypically i start a new session as soon as I begin to notice drift, before the model completely loses the thread. Note: Deliverables in chat, such as documents, in-line code, etc fill up the context window faster. \n\nSince you’re a plus user, you can also use projects, which are great because you can store any reference documents, deliverables, scripts etc. you can also provide project level custom instructions. \n\nAnother trick I like to use is to generate a “project bootstrap document” which contains the project plan, tasks, known deliverables, goals, and important parameters. This document goes into project files, and any time I start a new chat in that project i instruct ChatGPT to ingest the bootstrap document into running context, and then paste in the status summary from last chat session so it has both the overall project plan and can start where we last left off. This provides a really solid and more or less stable continuity state. \n\nHope this helps, goodluck and have fun!",

However, attempting to redo the same scan week later I am receiving very direct responses saying that it cannot, and has never been able to do this. \n\nAny help on how to help this is greatly appreciated.",
