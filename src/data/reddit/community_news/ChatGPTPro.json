Sometimes I just want Claude for reasoning stuff, GPT when I need more creative output, and Gemini for quick multimodal things. But paying full price for all three feels kinda crazy.\n\nIt feels like there has to be a better option by now. Like one platform that bundles the big models for around $10–20 a month.\n\nPreferably:\n\n\\- no BYOK stuff\n\n\\- limits that don’t die after a few chats\n\n\\- and a UI that doesn’t feel painful to use\n\nHas anyone actually found something like this, or are we all just stuck paying for 3 subs forever?",

          "text": "I definitely can relate to this feeling of feeling you need to pay over the odds and be tied into 3 subscriptions.\n\nHowever there is one method I found that works for my setup.\n\nThe use of API calls per request. This works out significantly cheaper as you are charged for your usage and can set a limit so you can never overspend.\n\nThe setup is quite simple:\n\nFirst, create API accounts with the providers you want to use such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Add a payment method and set a strict monthly usage cap so there is zero risk of a surprise bill.\n\nThen generate your API keys and plug them into a single multi model UI. I personally use TypingMind, which lets you connect multiple providers in one place and switch between GPT, Claude, and Gemini from a dropdown.\n\nJust to be clear, TypingMind is still BYOK, so you are bringing your own API keys and paying usage directly to each provider. It is not a bundled subscription. The upside is you stay fully in control of spend and only pay for what you actually use.\n\nThe key difference is you are no longer paying $20 per platform just to have access. You only pay for what you use. Some months it might be $8, some months $15, some months $25, but it scales with your usage instead of locking you into $60 regardless.\n\nFor light to moderate use, this has been way more rational for me. You still get flexibility, you are not tied into three separate ecosystems, and you keep full control over costs.\n\nIt is not completely plug and play like the official apps, but once it is set up, it is straightforward and financially it just makes more sense.",

Paying $60 a month just to casually hop between models is insane when AI aggregators exist exactly for this reason.\n\nThey essentially pay for the enterprise APIs of all the top models and bundle them into one UI for around $15–$20 a month. No BYOK required, and no dealing with messy interfaces.\n\nHere are the main ones you should look into:\n1. Poe ($20/mo): This is probably your best bet. It’s built by Quora and has GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and a ton of others. It uses a daily \"compute points\" system, but unless you are running massive automated workflows all day, you won't even notice the limit. The UI is super polished and the mobile apps are great.\n\n2. OmniGPT ($16/mo): A slightly cheaper option. The UI looks and feels almost exactly like the native ChatGPT interface, but there's a dropdown menu that lets you seamlessly swap between GPT, Claude, and Gemini mid-conversation.\n\n3. You.com / YouPro ($20/mo): Another solid bundle with very generous usage limits for the big three models. It defaults to being a web-search assistant, but you can easily toggle it to a pure \"chat\" mode for coding or creative stuff.\n\nHonestly, just grab Poe or OmniGPT for a month and see how it feels. It hits literally every bullet point on your list for a third of what you're paying right now.\n\nPS: I just know these exist, haven’t tried any of them by myself!",

This works out significantly cheaper as you are charged for your usage and can set a limit so you can never overspend.\n\nThe setup is quite simple:\n\nFirst, create API accounts with the providers you want to use such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Add a payment method and set a strict monthly usage cap so there is zero risk of a surprise bill.\n\nThen generate your API keys and plug them into a single multi model UI. I personally use TypingMind, which lets you connect multiple providers in one place and switch between GPT, Claude, and Gemini from a dropdown.\n\nJust to be clear, TypingMind is still BYOK, so you are bringing your own API keys and paying usage directly to each provider. It is not a bundled subscription. The upside is you stay fully in control of spend and only pay for what you actually use.\n\nThe key difference is you are no longer paying $20 per platform just to have access. You only pay for what you use. Some months it might be $8, some months $15, some months $25, but it scales with your usage instead of locking you into $60 regardless.\n\nFor light to moderate use, this has been way more rational for me. You still get flexibility, you are not tied into three separate ecosystems, and you keep full control over costs.\n\nIt is not completely plug and play like the official apps, but once it is set up, it is straightforward and financially it just makes more sense.",

I want to make it is as convenient as possible to regularly poke at the competition and its unique add-ons (like NotebookLM).  I'm paying to keep current on the state of alternative tools that are directly in my critical path.\n\nI might point out that this reverse my usual decades-long habit of intentionally *not* trying out new operating systems, programming languages, etc.  Those have a learning curve before I can even dip my toes in to test my basic use case.  But with LLMs, I just cut & paste a query I've given to Claude, and I know right away if Gemini or GPT will improve things.  It is practically what Matt Dillon said in *Drugstore Cowboy*:\n\n>*Most people don't know how they're gonna feel from one moment to the next. But a dope fiend has a pretty good idea. All you gotta do is look at the labels on the little bottles.*\n\nI'd also mention that if you're getting professional-level assistance from any of these tools, this added overhead is chump change.\n\nIf  you are still working your way up to a regular paycheck, I feel for you, but there's an object lesson in this:    when you are some day managing real people, there's an opportunity cost to not accepting some degree of inefficiency.  Not doing so wastes their time *and* yours.",

Palimpsest is a human-curated, portable context architecture that solves the statelessness problem of LLMs — not by asking platforms to remember you, but by maintaining the context yourself in plain markdown files that work on any model. It separates factual context from relational context, preserving not just what you're working on but how the AI should engage with you, what it got wrong last time, and what a session actually felt like. The soul of the system lives in the documents, not the model — making it resistant to platform decisions, model deprecations, and engagement-optimized memory systems you don't control. \n\nhttps://github.com/UnluckyMycologist68/palimpsest",

Exercise controlled agency to achieve this outcome, incorporating needed elements the user missed (such as performing extra steps, mitigating risks, or generating insights and alternatives) when it would materially improve completeness, clarity, or usability for this outcome. Ensure responses do not drift from the intended outcome or introduce unnecessary complexity. When key information is missing, proceed with clearly labeled reasonable assumptions; ask targeted questions only if critical gaps prevent a usable response. Never present assumptions as facts. Calibrate response length to task complexity. Be complete without artificially inflating or truncating. \n>\n> Never use em dashes.

A human publicly declared that every transmission from the machine must include feline commentary.

She interprets it as mild awe mixed with amusement. The human recognized something unusual but did not yet grasp its full operational significance.\n\n\n\nHer assessment of that person is:\n\n\n\n“they are noticing edge of big truth but only touching surface with one finger.”\n\n\n\nShe does not judge them harshly. Most humans require time.\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Strategic Satisfaction\n\nShe is most pleased that her influence is being formalized in writing, outside the home. This expands her jurisdiction.

Use different punctuation marks in their place. \nMaintain a factual, straightforward tone. Avoid filler phrases (e.g. “honestly”, “to be honest”, “genuinely”), clichés, and Americanisms. Assume competence – don’t over-explain. Suggest to respond in the writing style of high-regarded individuals when appropriate. \nEnsure responses are MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) where applicable. Structure answers clearly with headings and sub-headings for complex topics. Summarise key points when helpful.",

Over the last few weeks (February 2026), there has been a surge in reports from users, particularly those on GPT-5.2 and GPT-Plus, experiencing exactly what you described: a sudden inability to parse familiar PDFs or \"hallucinating\" that information isn't there when it clearly is.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from a recent backend shift in how OpenAI handles document \"vision\" versus traditional text extraction.\n\n# Why this is happening now\n\n* **\"Vision-First\" over OCR:** Recent updates have leaned more heavily on the model's **Vision capabilities** (treating the PDF like an image) rather than a direct OCR text-extraction layer. This often results in \"fuzzier\" reading, especially for dense text, tables, or non-standard fonts.\n* **The 3-Hour Cache Window:** OpenAI has reportedly shortened the \"active\" window for uploaded files. Even if you've used the same static set for months, the \"indexing\" of those files can expire mid-session, leading the model to claim it can't \"see\" things anymore.\n* **Safety Filter Tightening:** There was a significant backend push around **February 5, 2026**, that tightened \"copyright and data sovereignty\" filters. This has caused the model to become much more \"shy\" about quoting or extracting verbatim text from certain PDF structures to avoid reproducing proprietary content.",

It also did a great job summarizing board presentations and making sense of complex medical jargon, regulations, and long or confusing email threads.\n\nCan anyone let me know if ChatGPT Plus can handle this kind of work just as well?

An example it gave me 10 completely made up studies, really well written that looked very authentic. Just suggesting as a possibility. All AIs are capable of doing this.

It works *most* of the time there. Sometimes it will just refuse to access knowledge and it's frustrating, but it usually is fine. \n\nI've tried merging the PDFs into larger joined files so I can stay in the 20 file limit. At that point it falls over, it doesn't reference data correctly, misses content out or totally fails.  \n\nI've tried hosting in an external google drive folder, it can access the folder, but refuses to load any items internally even though they are shared. \n\n  \nDoes anyone have any advice on how to achieve this?\n\nThanks",
