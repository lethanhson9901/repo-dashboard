      "text": "1 year ago I posted \"12 lessons from 100% AI-generated code\" that hit 1M+ views. Some of those points evolved into agents.md, claude.md, plan mode, and context7 MCP. This is the 2026 version, learned from shipping products to production.\n\n**1- The first few thousand lines determine everything**\n\nWhen I start a new project, I obsess over getting the process, guidelines, and guardrails right from the start. Whenever something is being done for the first time, I make sure it's done clean. Those early patterns are what the agent replicates across the next 100,000+ lines. Get it wrong early and the whole project turns to garbage.\n\n**2- Parallel agents, zero chaos**\n\nI set up the process and guardrails so well that I unlock a superpower. Running multiple agents in parallel while everything stays on track. This is only possible because I nail point 1.\n\n**3- AI is a force multiplier in whatever direction you're already going**\n\nIf your codebase is clean, AI makes it cleaner and faster. If it's a mess, AI makes it messier faster. The temporary dopamine hit from shipping with AI agents makes you blind. You think you're going fast, but zoom out and you actually go slower because of constant refactors from technical debt ignored early.\n\n**4- The 1-shot prompt test**\n\nOne of my signals for project health: when I want to do something, I should be able to do it in 1 shot. If I can't, either the code is becoming a mess, I don't understand some part of the system well enough to craft a good prompt, or the problem is too big to tackle all at once and needs breaking down.\n\n**5- Technical vs non-technical AI coding**\n\nThere's a big difference between technical and non-technical people using AI to build production apps. Engineers who built projects before AI know what to watch out for and can detect when things go sideways. Non-technical people can't. Architecture, system design, security, and infra decisions will bite them later.\n\n**6- AI didn't speed up all steps equally**\n\nMost people think AI accelerated every part of programming the same way. It didn't. For example, choosing the right framework, dependencies, or database schema, the foundation everything else is built on, can't be done by giving your agent a one-liner prompt. These decisions deserve more time than adding a feature.\n\n**7- Complex agent setups suck**\n\nFancy agents with multiple roles and a ton of .md files? Doesn't work well in practice. Simplicity always wins.\n\n**8- Agent experience is a priority**\n\nTreat the agent workflow itself as something worth investing in. Monitor how the agent is using your codebase. Optimize the process iteratively over time.\n\n**9- Own your prompts, own your workflow**\n\nI don't like to copy-paste some skill/command or install a plugin and use it as a black box. I always change and modify based on my workflow and things I notice while building.\n\n**10- Process alignment becomes critical in teams**\n\nDoing this as part of a team is harder than doing it yourself. It becomes critical that all members follow the same process and share updates to the process together.\n\n**11- AI code is not optimized by default**\n\nAI-generated code is not optimized for security, performance, or scalability by default. You have to explicitly ask for it and verify it yourself.\n\n**12- Check git diff for critical logic**\n\nWhen you can't afford to make a mistake or have hard-to-test apps with bigger test cycles, review the git diff. For example, the agent might use created\\_at as a fallback for birth\\_date. You won't catch that with just testing if it works or not.\n\n**13- You don't need an LLM call to calculate 1+1**\n\nIt amazes me how people default to LLM calls when you can do it in a simple, free, and deterministic function. But then we're not \"AI-driven\" right?\n\n**EDIT:** since many are asking for examples, I already answered most of the questions in the comments with examples, and I started posting my learnings on the go on my [X account](https://x.com/QaisHweidi), and hopefully will keep posting",

What's better is to set the bar that the initial integration will at best be a workijg proof of concept. If you aim for a working proof of concept every time and can achieve being almost always successful on the first shot, then iterate towards DRY, separation of concerns, maintainable modularity, performance, security, and so on; each of those steps one at a time is fairly easy to accomplish.

I usually lean towards giving very detailed and drilled down specifications, and I was wondering whether I'm getting too specific and should be more laid-back instead. I like that your rule gives me a heuristic - yeah, I can try different levels of prompt granularity, but if it results in more back-and-forth, then I need to tighten prompts.  \n  \nAnd I generally appreciate your nuanced take which differentiates best practices for each use case, like the acknowledgement that sometimes deterministic algorithms are more appropriate, as well as careful thinking through without outsourcing to LLM.   \n  \nThe #10 is super interesting. I see a lot of discussions where people describe the state of their own development process, but very little about the process alignment within a team.  ",

Overall I like it, but I’m wondering if I'm missing out on other options which might be better to pay for.\n\nI mostly use AI for daily practical stuff, researching, summing up documents or threads, getting second opinions, cleaning up my writing etc. I recently started playing with image generator for content creations and ideas. Here is how ChatGPT summed up my usage:\n\n* Technical troubleshooting (yaml, wordpress, home servers, docker, networking, smart home, cameras, Home Assistant)\n* DIY / home projects (planning before doing anything expensive)\n* Business support (billing, coding logic, emails, contracts)\n* Writing help (emails, explanations, cleaning)\n* Light creative/marketing work (social posts, promos, restructuring content)\n* Translating/simplifying content (technical → plain language)\n* Decision-making and sanity checks (“does this make sense?”, “what am I missing?”)\n\nWhat matters most to me is good reasoning, being able to handle long context without losing track, and explanations that are clear but not dumbed down.   \nWhat I don't like about ChatGPT is that is doesn't handle long conversations i.e. troubleshooting, but I use projects as a workaround where I just start a new chat within a project when I am noticing that gpt is glitching. It is often overconfident while being wrong so I often have to sanity-check. I also need to keep correcting it's responses when it starts using too many emojis and bullet points. The image generator seems limited as well, it often trips when I want it to correct something, or corrects areas outside of my selection.\n\nI've seen people recommend Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity, and all-in-one platforms like Poe, Abacus, or OpenRouter. \n\n\\- Should I stay with ChatGPT or switch to other AI?  \n\\- Is an AIO platform worth it? It would be same price or even cheaper than ChatGPT Plus, but I can't find what would I miss out on with switching to these.",

Try Gemini if long context chats are way more important than a Projects folder function. \n\nGemini has a 1 million token context length, which makes it able to hold many or long documents or longer chat threads in one go. Though there is no projects folder function. \n\nI suggest trying Claude. It handles longer context better than ChatGPT by compacting content past its content window to still be visible in the chat thread. Claude also handles memory better. It can also search historic chat threads and save a manual memory, but it also has an automatic memory generated each night. The automatic memory is a TL;DR of your chat history and what Claude learns about you. The automatic memory and manual memory are served at the start of every chat thread. Claude is also more proactive about managing manual memory if you instruct it to in custom instructions. \n\nClaude also has a stronger Project folder system. You can attach many more files and it’ll index them for RAG.  Each Project also has its own automatic memory and manual memory. What’s great about this is Claude without having to perform a tool call know your progress on a project at the start of every chat thread.",

You’ll learn a lot just by doing that.\nOnce you let an agent work from the command line, it becomes way more powerful.

I explicitly told mine to warn me when we're around %80 tokens and never make things up. It didn't do this for a while but now it works. So when we come to an end of a chat, I tell it to give a summary and a snaphot and I start a new chat with those. By the way, I use chatgpt plus and I use it for daily stuff and I started to use it for coding a hobby game. I hear claude is better at coding, but chatgpt has been pretty good for what I needed so far. Unfortunately for coding the general context is not enough, and a lot of functions, variables need to be exactly the same so still we're losing some of them or the idea why we have them when we switch to a new chat. I don't know how this could be fixed as this is the way AI works...the more you throw at it, the more it understands you and eventually loses its shit at some point when it understands you the best...",

      "text": "I’ve been using GPT more or less as a second brain for a few years now, since 3.5. Long projects, planning, writing, analysis, all the slow messy thinking that usually lives in your own head. At this point I don’t really experience it as “a chatbot” anymore, but as part of my extended mind.\n\nIf that idea resonates with you – using AI as a genuine thinking partner instead of a fancy search box – you might like a small subreddit I started: r/Symbiosphere. It’s for people who care about workflows, limits, and the weird kind of intimacy that appears when you share your cognition with a model. If you recognize yourself in this post, consider this an open invitation.\n\nWhen 5.1 Thinking arrived, it finally felt like the model matched that use case. There was a sense that it actually stayed with the problem for a moment before answering. You could feel it walking through the logic instead of just jumping to the safest generic answer. Knowing that 5.1 already has an expiration date and is going to be retired in a few months is honestly worrying, because 5.2, at least for me, doesn’t feel like a proper successor. It feels like a shinier downgrade.\n\nAt first I thought this was purely “5.1 versus 5.2” as models. Then I started looking at how other systems behave. Grok in its specialist mode clearly spends more time thinking before it replies. It pauses, processes, and only then sends an answer. Gemini in AI Studio can do something similar when you allow it more time. The common pattern is simple: when the provider is willing to spend more compute per answer, the model suddenly looks more thoughtful and less rushed. That made me suspect this is not only about model architecture, but also about how aggressively the product is tuned for speed and cost.\n\nInitially I was also convinced that the GPT mobile app didn’t even give us proper control over thinking time. People in the comments proved me wrong. There is a thinking-time selector on mobile, it’s just hidden behind the tiny “Thinking” label next to the input bar. If you tap that, you can change the mode.\n\nAs a Plus user, I only see Standard and Extended. On higher tiers like Pro, Team or Enterprise, there is also a Heavy option that lets the model think even longer and go deeper. So my frustration was coming from two directions at once: the control is buried in a place that is very easy to miss, and the deepest version of the feature is locked behind more expensive plans.\n\nSwitching to Extended on mobile definitely makes a difference. The answers breathe a bit more and feel less rushed. But even then, 5.2 still gives the impression of being heavily tuned for speed. A lot of the time it feels like the reasoning is being cut off halfway. There is less exploration of alternatives, less self-checking, less willingness to stay with the problem for a few more seconds. It feels like someone decided that shaving off internal thinking is always worth it if it reduces latency and GPU usage.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I understand the temptation. Shorter internal reasoning means fewer tokens, cheaper runs, faster replies and a smoother experience for casual use. Retiring older models simplifies the product lineup. On a spreadsheet, all of that probably looks perfect.\n\nBut for those of us who use GPT as an actual cognitive partner, that trade-off is backwards. We’re not here for instant gratification, we’re here for depth. I genuinely don’t mind waiting a little longer, or paying a bit more, if that means the model is allowed to reason more like 5.1 did.\n\nThat’s why the scheduled retirement of 5.1 feels so uncomfortable. If 5.2 is the template for what “Thinking” is going to be, then our only real hope is that whatever comes next – 5.3 or whatever name it gets – brings back that slower, more careful style instead of doubling down on “faster at all costs”.\n\nWhat I would love to see from OpenAI is very simple: a clearly visible, first-class deep-thinking mode that we can set as our default. Not a tiny hidden label you have to discover by accident, and not something where the only truly deep option lives behind the most expensive plans. Just a straightforward way to tell the model: take your time, run a longer chain of thought, I care more about quality than speed.\n\nFor me, GPT is still one of the best overall models out there. It just feels like it’s being forced to behave like a quick chat widget instead of the careful reasoner it is capable of being. If anyone at OpenAI is actually listening to heavy users: some of us really do want the slow, thoughtful version back.",

Should customers rest satisfied with a $200/mo model that’s so flawed?***\n\nOpenAI deals with the problem by resorting to **gobbledygook on its pricing page**. It previously said that Pro subscribers get “**maximum memory and context**.” On a version now rolling out, it says that Pro subscriptions **\"Keep full context with maximum memory.\"**\n\n[https://chatgpt.com/pricing](https://chatgpt.com/pricing)\n\nThe facts behind these misleading words:\n\n**(1)** In **5.2-Instant,** Pro subscriptions offer a larger context window than Plus (128K vs. 32K) and the same memory. But what Pro subscriber pays $200/month for greater Instant context?\n\n**(2)** In **5.2-thinking**, Pro and Plus subscriptions offer identical 196K context windows and memory.\n\n**(3)** **5.2-Pro** (the model) also offers a 196K context window…***but without memory***.\n\n**Are they hoping that deceptive language will hide Pro’s defect? Do they think that users just don’t care?** ***What is OpenAI selling for $200 if the flagship model can’t use Memory?***\n\n***EDIT: I'd like to see to see the issue discussed until OpenAI recognizes the need to build a Pro with memory.***\n\n***After months, they acknowledged that memory is \"not available with Pro.\" After months, they've begun replacing plain  falsehood with misleading gobbledyook on their pricing page. If the community shows its dissatisfaction with a frontier/\"research-grade\" model that lacks Memory, they may begin fixing the problem—over time, if not right away.***\n\n***If that sounds like a plea to add to or support the thread, that's because it is. OpenAI takes notice of what goes on here and in*** r/OpenAI. **I** **will show my good taste by refusing to mention** r/ChatGPT.\n\n***I've pinned the thread in an effort to keep it alive.***",

Remember how turning on “research” on 4o or 4.5 would make it give you impersonal search-engine-like responses, but then you could turn it off again and 4o would be able to take that data and recontextualize it? Can’t we still switch between models mid-session and have 5.2 Instant or 5.2 Thinking commit relevant material to long-term memory? For engineering projects, 5.2 Pro and Codex have proven to be godsends. If you need personalized RAG, use Projects and feed it the documents you need. Or use Codex in VS Code (if aren’t at least experimenting with that, do you *really* need a Pro account? Probably not.) and have it take notes. Instead of keeping it locked to 5.3 Pro, set it to Auto, or periodically switch to one of the other models and commit things to memory. They aren’t kidding when they call the Pro model (not account tier) Research-grade intelligence. In my experience, it’s far better at dealing with highly complex scenarios that require referencing a large and diverse body of disparate knowledge and then synthesizing understanding of something new and novel and *technically correct*. It’s rigorous. It triple checks. It does what it needs to do to make sure the metaphorical (or literal) bridge doesn’t fall down. When I care about it remembering the specifics of my life, or even the bigger picture of what I’m working on, I can just switch out of Pro. And really, the main reason for me to have a Pro *account* these days is the higher Codex rate limits.",

The best solution I’ve found is to create a Project and write your constraints in the project’s custom instructions. \n\nFor example at my job where we mainly use this software for technical and legal writing (internally) and citation checking (for filings) our main issue is the adding of spaces and extra lines, and defaulting to dramatic internet tone. This issue is specific to ChatGPT. No other LLM, including CoPilot which uses GPT, seems prone to this. It must be some additional layer of programming they’ve added to it. If you need to paste into a Word docx and use the output for business, this is terrible. Deleting hundreds of extra spaces in a long bibliography is brutal. There is software made to remove ChatGPT’s spaces, but really we should be able to instruct this and tell a model to use CMOS, APA, or other style. \n\nThe tone and spacing that current ChatGPT models erroneously default to and drift back to in long context windows is what I’d call Reddit-style or fanfic-style, like:\n\n“And then she stopped. \n\nToo fast. Too long.”\n\nAs you can imagine, this is quite strange in a business context. In long chats you can see the tone move away from business at the beginning to this casual-dramatic style. Custom instructions in a project helps but it still isn’t perfect. You may just have to open a new chat and re-instruct when you see the drift.",

The tech has improved a lot, but in longer sessions I still kept running into the same few issues:\n\n* Memory: once a thread gets long, details get fuzzy and continuity breaks\n* Character consistency: especially with multiple NPCs, personalities/voice start blending\n* Rejections: some RP setups involve mature themes, and many tools shut down quickly even when the intent is story/character work\n\nOver the past 6 months I built a project called “Roleplay Game Master” to address those AI roleplaying issues:\n\n* Memory: uses vector-based retrieval to maintain context and coherence in long threads\n* Character consistency: use the best instruction following and roleplaying model (Gemini 3) to power the underlying itnelligence\n* Rejections: custom prompting to maximize creative freedom and to minimize rejections\n\nYou can try it here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master](https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master)\n\nHere are some user review:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4wpb2wj3z2jg1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e754c557aff50ba835dff2e7414a8589b693a18\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q6dxwj3z2jg1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=143a5006741509c37cf4503bfa0f16b9a5db8bcd",

      "text": "Matt Shumer mentioned that the model released last week (GPT-5.3 Codex) gave him the sense of something akin to \"judgment\"—a subtle capacity, almost like \"taste,\" to know what is correct—which was once believed to be something AI could never possess. He said the model either already has it, or is so infinitely close that the distinction between the two has become irrelevant.\n\nThis deeply resonates with me. The boundary between AI tools and humans is indeed becoming increasingly blurred. I see ChatGPT and Gemini taking over writing and planning, tools like VOMO automatically summarizing meetings, and Canva replacing junior design work. I do not fantasize that \"learning artificial intelligence\" alone can protect my job forever, but at least I thought it could buy me more time.\n\nBut now, I am increasingly accepting a viewpoint that may be closer to the truth: If you think that \"learning AI\" will protect your job, that may be an illusion. The future workplace may divide into two extremes: either companies fully embrace AI with highly automated processes, or they shift completely toward fields that rely solely on human traits.\n\nIt would be a lie to say I am not anxious—in this gradually blurring boundary, how should we conduct ourselves?",

      "text": "I'm fairly inexperienced with AI so I apologize if there are some dumb questions in here. \n\nLong story short, I've been using ChatGPT for about a year to assist with B2B sales. I have a thread where I can post a company's website and it will return an analysis of that company, what their needs are, and where our best in might be. I have a thread for prospect discovery. And I have a thread for drafting quick emails, among a few other threads.\n\nA few weeks ago I had the idea of trying to create a CRM within ChatGPT, to expand on the Google Sheet that I have used over the years for organization, and so far the AI has been useful. But I have some concerns with long term viability:\n\n1.) I've noticed over the past year that ChatGPT does not do well on long threads, whether that be slowing down or losing context. I'm afraid that I'm going to need to create new threads so often that it won't be worth my time, and that I may also lose context while switching over to a new thread.\n\n2.) ChatGPT apparently can't share information between threads? It would be nice if my emails thread had access to my CRM thread. That way I wouldn't have to provide context for each email.  \n\n3.) Redundancy. I'm still using the Google Sheet as a backup, so I'm entering info on the Google Sheet and then pasting it into ChatGPT. If we could remove a step there, that would also be nice. \n\nI really just want something where I can enter the info in Google Sheets, and then find an AI that can get live access to the the Google Sheet. So when I ask it a question or ask it for tasks for the day, it has all of that information without having to load all of the prospect info into a thread. \n\nLike I said, I haven't explored the AI world too much. I just learned about Claude the other day. I downloaded Claude and gave it permission to view my Google Drive. But it is telling me that it can't read Google Sheets? I knew Google had an AI, but didn't realize that Gemini was a full chatbot. So maybe that is the right move? \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions before I put a few hours into just experimenting?",

          "text": "If you're working with Google Sheets, the best AI is Gemini because it's now in every native Google app, from YouTube to Google Keep, Google Calendar, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Slides, and Google Sheets. We can't have a Gemini within Google Sheets itself; you can either upload a Google Sheets document or give a Google Drive. When you're typing up your prompt, you can select the file from Google Drive, then open it and work with it. Any live changes you make with Google Workspace apps will update the file.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're working on a thread in Google Docs, asking questions or getting info, and you make a change in Google Sheets, it will update in the thread at the same time. Native Google apps can change them. The way I do this is: let's say they upload a Google Doc. I ask it to make these changes, and then open it in Canvas. I've attached a document. In Google Drive, you can select your document. I give it my prompt, select Canvas at the same time, tell it to do this, and then open it in Canvas, because from there, you can see the changes it has made.\n\nI haven't personally worked with Google Sheets. I mostly work with Google Slides and Google Docs, and it's so seamless and smooth that it works perfectly. But I believe Google Sheets is just because Gemini is natively within each Google Workspace app, and there's seamless integration. That's why I think Gemini would be the best option. At the same time, another reason is that Gemini's context window is 1 million tokens. \n\nChatGPT is great, but if you're not using the API, your context window is limited. GPT 5.2 thinking is limited to 196,000 context tokens, but it's limited to a 196,000-context window. However, an API can be up to 400,000, which is a lot. But in Gemini, within the chatbot itself (without using the API), the context window is 1 million, so it can read, synthesize, analyze, understand, and remember much more information.\n\nIn long-term threads and working with larger files/documents like PDFs, Google Sheets, or native Google Labs, Gemini is the best. I would never trust giving ChatGPT, for example, access to 20-30 page PDF articles and then asking questions, working with them, or using them in a paper or report. But I would trust Gemini much more because of the context window, because I know I can tell confidently that it actually reads and assesses them. But ChatGPT, because of its limited context window, once it runs, it will hallucinate when it reaches its limits. Unless, again, you're using an API key, in which case you have up to 400,000 tokens. \n\nAlso, I'm assuming you have a ChatGPT Pro subscription? Keep that because it's great. You have access to GPT 5.2 Pro, and with GPT 5.2, you have access to Heavy Thinking. You have access to much deeper research queries per month and a lot more agent queries. It's just great.\n\nChatGPT, this is just general advice you should know. ChatGPT has the best chatbot experience, and it's a jack of all trades, but I like to say it's a jack of all trades and a master of none. However, their long memory feature is the best. The fact that, let's say, you told it something three months ago, and it remembers, for instance, is just amazing. Let's say you're writing an email and you put your phone number at the bottom, then write a new email months later and need to add it at the end. It'll remember that perfectly. So, its long memory feature is the best.\n\nThe chatbot experience is the best, and with most app connectors like Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Booking.com, Spotify, Apple Music, and so many other tools and apps. Also, its deep research is pretty thorough and actually synthesizes, analyzes, and digests information. It uses reasoning in its deep research.\n\nNow, Gemini, since you have ChatGPT Pro, I'm assuming you do, since you're making this post in this thread. If you have ChatGPT Pro, you don't need to get Gemini Ultra or Gemini AI Pro, which costs the same as ChatGPT Plus at $25/month and gives you many musician limits. For instance, it gives you 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day and 25 deep research queries per day. Gemini's deep research is pretty thorough; it's also useful for reasoning. The search takes anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, and Google's indexing is on par. It has access to the most credible, reliable, and relevant sources when you do deep research with it. If you use any Google Apps, such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, or Gmail, there's no question that you should get Gemini AI Pro, which gives you access to NotebookLM Pro with generous limits as well.\n\nThis is not an ad; I'm just advocating for them because they're actually offering a lot of great tools and features, along with generous usage limits. Gemini is now Google's only product. Google makes a lot of software, hardware, and ads, but ChatGPT is OpenAI's only product (with ChatGPT Atlas as well), and at the same time, it's still ChatGPT. If they're not number one, they're dead, but Google can afford to give people generous limits essentially, and they're experimenting so much by giving these many features, etc. Like in NotebookLM with Gemini AI Pro, you can make 500 notebooks each with 300 sources, and you can make 25 audio reviews, 25 video overviews, and 25 video reviews per day, which is crazy. So, consider Gemini Pro specifically for this use case, and I believe that with Gemini Pro and Chachi on the Pro subscription, you don't need any other AI tool at all.",

If you're more of a DIY person and don't need a meeting sidebar, you can use a tool like Whisper to transcribe audio to text, and then use GPT to summarize or highlight key points in real-time. It gives you fast transcription during the meeting.",

Imagine a research agent with skills like “search web,” “summarize,” and “write report.” If each skill keeps passing its full output into the next call, the context window fills up fast, and the plan drifts. Instead, you can keep each skill narrow and only pass back a short, structured result, like key findings, so the planner decides what actually goes into the next prompt.",
