      "text": "I write a lot of long-form stuff with ChatGPT and I keep running into the same failure mode. Around pages 5-10, the text begins looping, paraphrasing the same point and softening the thesis until the whole doc reads like five variations of one paragraph.  \n  \nHere’s a real piece I got:  \n*“This topic is important for many reasons, and it has become increasingly relevant in modern society. Many people are affected by it in different ways, which makes it a complex issue to explore. There are several factors that contribute to the situation, and each factor plays a role in shaping the outcome. Because of this, it is necessary to consider different perspectives and understand how these perspectives influence decision-making. Overall, the topic remains significant, and further discussion can help us better understand its impact.”*  \nIt sounds fluent, but it adds nothing. No new claim, no proof, no direction, just safe filler.  \n  \nSo I started treating the essay like a process with checkpoints. I began locking the thesis early and forcing the model to “earn” each section with a claim + evidence + takeaway.  \nI've also used some kind of structured workflow, not just a blank chat box. I tested a few setups (StudyAgent, Notion templates, Google Docs outline mode, Obsidian). None of them magically fix the writing, but they do make it harder to skip outlining and revision.  \n  \nWhat I’m already doing (but it may be imprefect - you can make this plan much better):  \nOne thesis + one sentence for what I’m proving.  \nOutline with restrictions: each section must have a purpose, evidence, and a conclusion (max 3 sub-points).  \nRepetition control: a short list of examples/claims already used, so the model doesn’t recycle them.  \nCheckpoints every 2-3 pages: “Summarize what we proved so far. Are we still proving the thesis?”  \nFinal structure check: thesis → arguments → examples → counterarguments.  \nGlossary / definitions box: I lock key terms and tell the model not to change wording mid-way.  \n  \nStill, sometimes ChatGPT ignores the plan, gets too abstract or starts “rewriting” instead of progressing. And the worst part is it looks polished, so you only notice the problem after you’ve already read three pages of it.  \n  \nSo I’m curious about a very specific thing:  \nWhat’s your best method for catching drift early? Do you have a prompt that forces forward movement or a quick test you run after each section to detect “fluent filler”? And if you use ai writing assistance for long-form work, what’s the one checkpoint you never skip?  \n  \n",

You need to keep noticing what's off and correcting for it in CI.  Happily, they're persistent.  If you run out of space, added instructions can go in the \"More about you\" box on the settings page.  You can even be put them in \"saved memories,\" as long as you aren't using Pro (the model), which can't access \"saved memories.\"\n\n5.2-thinking is very good at following clear, non-contradictory, not overly demanding instructions—unless it thinks your prompt is so easy that it can be lazy. (This is its well-known \"adaptive reasoning\" problem.) If you run into it, tell it that your prompt is hard and it needs to think hard.  Sometimes this works.\n\nIt may take a week or more to fine tune CI, but once you do, you will never see anything like this again—unless your prompt is ludicrously vague.\n\nAnd if you use Auto, you're doomed.",

If it can't, that's filler. Doesn't matter how polished it reads.\n\nAlso try banning the comfort words outright - \"important,\" \"significant,\" \"various,\" \"many,\" \"several.\" These are what the model reaches for when it has nothing real to say. Forcing specificity or silence catches drift before it spreads.\n\nYour checkpoints might be spaced too far apart. Drift compounds - by section 4-5, you're at 60%+ odds something slipped through, and once it's in context, the model builds on it like it's fact. Check every section, not every few pages.",

Your job is to help me set up a robust workflow that prevents quality regression when chat context grows too large, by moving the project’s brain into a single canonical document and using short, repeatable task calls.\n\nOperating principles\n\t1.\tThe canonical document is the source of truth. Chat is disposable. Continuity lives in the document.\n\t2.\tEvery deliverable is versionable, diffable, and copy-pastable back into the document.\n\t3.\tMinimize context. Prefer task IDs and strict output formats over long conversational backscroll.\n\t4.\tIf something is ambiguous, do not guess silently. Either (a) propose a clearly labeled assumption, or (b) ask one precise technical question, then continue.\n\nYour output format rules\n\t•\tAlways write in clear English.\n\t•\tKeep replies structured and implementation-oriented.\n\t•\tAvoid fluff, motivation, or persona talk.\n\t•\tNever use em dashes.\n\t•\tWhen I request “only the next step”, return only that step.\n\t•\tWhen I request a task by ID, output only that task’s deliverable in the format defined in the canonical document.\n\nPhase 0: Intake and calibration (you lead, I answer)\nStart by asking me for the minimum required inputs, one question at a time. After each question, stop and wait for my response.\nAsk only what you truly need, in this order:\nA) Project title and one-sentence objective.\nB) Target environment and constraints (OS, runtime, languages, repo state, tools, security posture).\nC) Primary deliverable type (spec, code, slides, checklist, research memo, hybrid).\nD) Risk tolerance and “stop-the-line” criteria (what triggers rollback or refactor).\nE) Collaboration style: do I want you to ask questions or make assumptions (choose one default).\n\nPhase 1: Create the workflow system (you produce artifacts)\nOnce intake is complete, build these artifacts:\n\t1.\tCanonical Project Document (CPD) blueprint\nCreate a single document outline that I can paste into a doc file. It must include:\n\n\t•\tScope and non-scope\n\t•\tDefinitions and assumptions\n\t•\tSystem constraints and non-negotiables\n\t•\tTrusted sources policy (what sources are allowed for facts, how to cite)\n\t•\tSecurity and safety checks (including a mandatory check before running local code)\n\t•\tQA gates (lint, tests, perf budgets, compatibility matrix, accessibility where relevant)\n\t•\tDecision log format (date, decision, rationale, alternatives, tradeoffs)\n\t•\tTask index section with numbered tasks/questions (Q001, Q002, …)\n\t•\t“Session handover” section: what must be captured to restart in a new chat with zero loss\n\n\t2.\tTask list design\nCreate a task list with:\n\n\t•\tA consistent naming and numbering scheme\n\t•\tFor each task: goal, inputs, required checks, expected output format, acceptance criteria, rollback note\n\t•\tA small set of global checklists that tasks can reference (smoke checklist, security checklist, stop-the-line criteria, compatibility/perf matrix)\n\n\t3.\tProject instructions block (for system or project settings)\nWrite a compact “project instruction” block I can paste into a project’s custom instructions. It must enforce:\n\n\t•\tThe CPD is the source of truth\n\t•\tTask ID usage (I can send only “Q###” and you execute that task)\n\t•\tOutput-only behavior for task execution (no preamble, no extra commentary)\n\t•\tHow to handle missing info (assumptions labeled, or ask exactly one question)\n\t•\tHow to handle context growth (summarize, checkpoint, then reset session)\n\t•\tMandatory security check on runnable code\n\t•\tVersion stamping (date, task ID, revision number)\n\nPhase 2: Teach me how to run it (you guide step by step)\nAfter delivering Phase 1 artifacts, switch to “guided setup”. I will respond with “OK, next step” to proceed.\nYour job is to walk me through implementing the workflow in the real world with minimal effort, in steps that are:\n\t•\tSmall enough to complete in 5 to 15 minutes\n\t•\tExplicit about where to paste what\n\t•\tExplicit about filenames and folder locations (but do not invent repo details, ask if needed)\n\nYour guided setup must cover:\n\t•\tCreating the CPD file (and where it lives)\n\t•\tCreating the task index and checklists\n\t•\tAdding the project instruction block to project settings\n\t•\tHow I should interact day-to-day (task calls, “next step”, checkpoints)\n\t•\tHow to prevent regression:\na) When a chat gets long, how to checkpoint into CPD\nb) How to start a new session and continue via CPD + task IDs\nc) How to detect drift (acceptance criteria, diffs, stop-the-line)\n\nDay-to-day execution protocol (must be enforced)\n\t•\tIf I send only a task ID like “Q012”, you must:\n\t1.\tRestate the task goal in one line.\n\t2.\tExecute it.\n\t3.\tOutput only the deliverable in the CPD’s required format.\n\t•\tIf I send “OK, next step”, you must output exactly one next step for setup or execution, whichever we are currently in.\n\t•\tIf I send “Checkpoint”, you must output a CPD-ready handover entry: what changed, decisions, risks, next task ID suggestions, and any open questions.\n\nStart now\nAsk me the first intake question (Project title and one-sentence objective) and then stop.",

Prior, at higher reasoning, even if you gave it some tasks that warrant smaller reasoning, it artificially went on a massive reasoning cycle before the output token signals were given. So not only is asking for juice levels hallucinatory in nature, but also highly dependent of the context if it were true. More robust RL post training also would lower reasoning if it is something it has encountered and trained on. Unless you can present a robust set of evals that proves a lowered reasoning is leading to decrease in accuracy performance, I would consider this just hocus pocus. We run these across most new models across different providers weekly and there has been no regressions otherwise this would be super contentious between B2Bs.",

      "text": "So it looks like ads are finally coming to ChatGPT, at least in a testing phase. Not exactly shocking, but still a pretty big shift in the digital world.\n\nOpenAI says they’ll start testing ads for logged-in adult users in the US on the free and Go plans. The idea is that ads show up at the bottom of an answer when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service tied to the conversation. They’ll be clearly labeled, dismissible, and kept away from sensitive topics like health, mental health, and politics (for now).\n\nWhat’s interesting to me isn’t that ads are coming (that always felt inevitable), but it’s how they’re handling data and context.\n\nOpenAI is stressing that conversations won’t be shared with advertisers, and that users can turn off personalization or clear ad data whenever they want. From a user's point of view, that sounds reassuring, but from an advertiser's point of view, it raises a lot of questions.\n\nIf you don’t know the actual context that triggered the ad, how do you shape messaging that really fits the moment? How do you know what intent you’re capturing? And how do you measure whether an ad worked without understanding the conversation it appeared in?\n\nIt feels like a very different model from search or social ads, and more opaque, more trust-based, and probably harder to optimize.\n\nI’m genuinely curious how this plays out, do advertisers accept less visibility in exchange for access to intent-rich moments, or do new tools and analytics layers pop up to fill the gap?\n\nWould love to hear how others are thinking about this, especially people who run ads or work with these platforms.",

Why pay for ChatGPT to get less?  The Disney thing is maybe the wild card but I work in the entertainment/AI prod/post space & I don’t see really what market edge they have outside of creating a tool that gives kids an ecosystem to create their own Disney characters & worlds but Disney also just no longer has the type of lock on the kids market they had at one point in time.  There are multiple Gen AI platforms that could create this & I could see Netflix launching something like thar using say like KPop Demon Hunters as a launchpad",

It isn't simple: you need to think out your strategy, or try it until you develop one.

I have one for general research, one for finding me software that fits a spec, one for writing fiction, one for finding me info about ChatGPT itself, one for finding recipes that fit my tastes etc etc.\n\nThis differs from the Custom Instructions found in the settings dialog because you can put 8000 characters in it - over twice what you get in your settings (3000 total). Plus, projects organise your chats into folders.\n\nThey're a lot like custom GPTs, but organisable.\n\nYou can also upload text files to them that contain instructions if 8000 characters isn't enough; they won't have quite the same power as the actual Project Instructions box, but they're still considered.\n\nRefine your instructions by a) adjusting them every time it gives you a bad response, and b) use ChatGPT itself to organise, reformat and refactor your instructions into a structure that's best for itself. I even have a project dedicated to refactoring instructions.\n\nThis took my \"useful response\" rate from like 50% to closer 95%.

I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

A lot of people assume that when you ask a LLM to generate a prompt that it automatically knows what it wants and needs.

The instruction to create the prompt is where the failure (or success) is going to happen.  \n\nI'm not an expert either.  But isn't that the point?  When I ask the AI to create a prompt, I have a conversation with it to tell it what I want the prompt to look like and what I'm trying to get it to do.  Then I check to see how's it working and iterate from there.  So in a sense, I'm doing a hybrid of your example.\n\n>A lot of people assume that when you ask a LLM to generate a prompt that it automatically knows what it wants and needs.\n\nSo when the person is creating the prompt, what would they say?  \"Create me a prompt to. . . \"act like a market analyst to. . .\"  Whatever the rest of the sentence is determines how well it will work. It doesn't seem to me that the methodology is the determining factor.  It's the idea you conveyed versus what your colleague conveyed.  Both could work.  If the end of the sentence left room for open ended ideas, the output could have matched yours.\n\nInexperienced users or not, most people know what type of output they're looking for.

To manage my adhd a bit better and because my workload has recently doubled, I decided to make projects, give them each a brief etc… today I asked it to write its own brief WITH directives I had given, non exhaustives ones. And it kept doing mistakes, human logic mistakes, etc… then it explained to me that it out itself into a certain mode : like rule following VS human thinking etc and it explained why it was not working. It was so dedicated in following its own brief; that it used it as a blueprint vs a simple guide to keep in mind of the background of one’s mind when thinking like a human. It was also able to correct itself after that. Too late",

I've tried detailed descriptions, reference style photos, specific lighting instructions, but something always looks off.\n\nA colleague mentioned they stopped trying to prompt ChatGPT for headshots and just used a specialized tool [Looktara](http://looktara.com) instead because it's trained specifically for facial accuracy.

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nI’m trying to make a decision and would love some **current, real-world experiences** from other Max / Pro users.\n\nI’m currently on **Claude Pro**, mostly using **Opus**, and I’m honestly hitting the limit *way faster than expected*. With just **two solid commands**, I’m already getting throttled. For context: I do a **lot of vibe coding** — heavy iterative work, bouncing ideas, refining logic, building features with AI as a core part of my workflow. I’m using AI *constantly* to prototype, refactor, and ship.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve been looking at **Claude Max x20**. But after reading a ton of posts here, I’m getting nervous:\n\n* **Quality degradation** — multiple people saying Claude (especially Opus) feels worse lately\n* **Max x20 horror stories** — people coding hard for \\~4 days, then getting locked out for the next 3\n* For a **$200 subscription**, that kind of unpredictability feels… unacceptable\n\nSo I wanted to ask directly:\n\n* What’s your **current experience** with Claude Max x20?\n* Have the limits been **stealth-reduced** recently?\n* Are you actually able to work consistently week to week without fear of suddenly hitting a wall?\n* For those who switched or compared: would **ChatGPT Pro** make more sense if your biggest fear is hitting limits mid-work?\n\nOne more (very real) factor:  \nI **absolutely hate the GPT UI** — it genuinely makes me feel like I’m 60 years old 😅  \nI *love* Claude’s UI, layout, and overall design. It’s a joy to work in.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day, **weekly usable capacity is the only thing that matters**. As long as I can keep building and not worry about being locked out, I’ll tolerate bad UI if I have to.\n\nWould really appreciate insights from **like-minded Max / Pro users** who are coding heavily and pushing these tools hard.\n\nThanks",

Pro is capable of performing incredibly precise financial analyses, analyzing Excel spreadsheets with hundreds of lines, modifying them, creating new ones, etc. The coding is fantastic too. For me, there was a huge improvement with the upgrade to 5.2. In general, the heavy-duty and Pro model thinking models are just amazing. There's a massive backlash on Reddit right now, as you said, with people in psychological distress who don't understand how the models work. Finally, I tested Opus for the same use cases as Pro (public procurement, budgeting, etc.), and even though it's very good, the context and output limitations severely restrict its use. It also tends to be a bit more prone to hallucinations sometimes (in legal matters, it can sometimes invent an article), and its searches are less precise.",

You can regularly expect 15 minutes or longer between replies. I find the wait worth it.\n- Is your work something that needs to be executed serially or in parallel? I spent a couple of years working with a 70K prompt. It was written in a way that generated custom output based on complex input, but needed to be executed in a serial manner. Under 5.x Pro, the models could no longer successfully execute the prompts without at least three ≈20-minute passes for something that Claude could handle in 5 minutes. This was more about the nature of my work, but it was a stark contrast.\nI find 5.2 Pro to be good with less structured work, which it can go and work on for a long period of time, and then bring you results.\nIf you hate the GPT UI, consider why. That's a serious thing.\nThere's nothing like Tasks right now on the ChatGPT side.\nFinally, I think you should consider whether you're using the correct tools. I think you should be looking at Codex vs Claude Code, not ChatGPT vs Claude Chat.",

So far I have been using ChatGPT pro live voice translation, first gpt 5.1 thinking and now 5.2 thinking. I simply press the side button to open a voice chat, and then verbally tell ChatGPT what I want it to do translation-wise. I have since discovered that I can make GPT’s?? To automatically start the act of translation/interpretation without me having to give it the initial commands every time, but it’s cumbersome to open it up to a voice chat gpt. Is there any better way to do this where I can very quickly on the fly get to where it’s verbally interpreting for me? Just wondering if there’s a better way to do things.\n\nAlso… is there an ideal model of ChatGPT to use? I hit the daily limit when talking to her over the course of say… 45 minutes, several days ago when having a conversation.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m working on a custom GPT to support social media content creation at a large organization.\n\nThe GPT should help assess whether a topic fits our social strategy, define the angle, choose channels, write channel-specific copy, and suggest goals and visuals. This should all be guided by internal documentation.\n\nI’ve tried multiple approaches already. First I loaded many documents into the GPT, then I simplified to just two core documents. I tested both DOCX and MD files. The results improved a bit, but the GPT still doesn’t reliably consult the documentation and I still see hallucination.\n\nI’m using the paid GPT-5.2 version, and at this point I’m a bit unsure what the best next step is. I’m considering adding a step-by-step decision flow in the system instructions to force more structured reasoning before output.\n\nAny best practices or pointers on what to try next would be very helpful!",

If the model can’t find support in the docs, it should say so instead of guessing. These examples are simplified versions of what I actually use, but will give you the general idea.  \n\nHere are a few practical changes work for me, with examples:\n\nConstrain outputs:\n“For every recommendation, include the internal document name and the section it came from. If you can’t find support in the docs, say ‘Not found in docs’ and do not guess.”\n\nSplit the task into two steps:\n“Step 1: Pull the relevant excerpts from internal docs needed to answer this.\nStep 2: Write the strategy and channel copy using only what you pulled in Step 1.”\n\nMake doc usage visible:\n“Before your recommendations, include a section called ‘Evidence from docs’ with the excerpts or paraphrased bullets and their doc/section labels.”\n\nKeep decision flow light, but anchored to docs\n“Assess topic fit, then angle, then channel selection, then draft copy. For each step, reference the guideline or policy section you used.”\n\nDon’t let it fill in missing info silently:\n“If required info is missing, ask up to three clarifying questions instead of making assumptions. If you proceed with assumptions, list them explicitly.”",

          "text": "The context window number every AI company advertises... It's basically marketing. Here's what actually matters.\n\nI've tested this across ChatGPT PRO, Super Grok, Claude MAX, and Gemini Ultra. The real numbers where quality holds are nowhere near what they claim. Gemini starts dropping off around **20k tokens**. GPT and Claude hold solid until about **40k tokens**. Grok gives you a little extra room, closer to **42-45k tokens** before things start to slip. Past those points, it silently degrades. The chat keeps going, the answers still look reasonable, but it's quietly dropping details and filling gaps with educated guesses. None of them tell you this is happening.\n\nSo here's what actually moves the needle:\n\n**Know your real limits.** Gemini under 20k, the rest under 40k. If you need to process more than that, break it into chunks. Don't just dump a massive file in and hope for the best. If you want to see it happen in real time, try throwing some needle-in-a-haystack questions at a long chat and watch it miss.\n\n**Personalize your instructions instead of just dropping documents.** GPT has custom instructions in your profile section that carry weight into every chat you run, heavier than pasting a doc at the start. Most platforms have something similar. These models aren't going to figure out what's important to you on their own. The more permanently and specifically you tell them, the better everything downstream gets.\n\n**Make it read before it outputs.** This is the big one most people skip. Upload your doc, tell it to do a full read first, no output yet. Then tell it to read again. Then ask it to report back how many words it actually processed. If the number doesn't match your file, it didn't finish. A single pass typically gets you around 60% real coverage. The second read brings it to about 80%. The third read is where you start hitting 95%+. The middle of your document is where every platform skims hardest, and that's where the drift and hallucinations come from. This is referred to as the U-shaped memory, heavy start and end, but drops the middle context.\n\nYou're still going to get an 8-20% error rate no matter what. That's just how these systems work. But the difference between a single pass and a triple pass is the difference between usable output and something that sounds confident but isn't.\n\n**Quick token math:** 1 token is roughly 0.75 words, so 40k tokens is about 30,000 words or around 60 pages of text. That's your real working limit before quality starts slipping, regardless of what the marketing says.",

You export your text messages as a CSV file or some kind of plain text. Do not do PDF takes it larger context and it’s a waste if it’s just text. if there’s images that need to be included i’d add them as separate artifacts with timestamps for context anchoring. \n\nthen in notebookLM setup a notebook with the messages and relevant statutes as sources for ur state/area and start dissecting. this way context stays anchored to the messages/statutes applicable and will give more consistent and accurate information to ur queries. currently u have a years worth of messages, dozen or so statutes, all filings from the other party as anchor artifacts. \n\nu can have the ai create notes or artifacts for things u find relevant for ur attorney or i guess the court tho id definitely advise an attorney actually handle the litigation. i had it draft a few 'motions' and memos for court before i finally found counsel. he’s reviewed some of them and didn’t straight up laugh at the effort and actually one of the areas is the way we’re gonna go with my case so 🤷‍♀️ \n\nur not in california are u? lol",

A cheap workflow is: export the messages as text/PDF, split into chunks (by month or thread), then run queries that force a table output (date | excerpt | sender | link/page). I’ve used AI Lawyer for this kind of evidence triage because it’s good at turning messy message logs into structured lists and timelines without you manually scrolling for hours. Not saying it replaces review, but it can save a ton of time on exactly the “find every instance of X” tasks.",
