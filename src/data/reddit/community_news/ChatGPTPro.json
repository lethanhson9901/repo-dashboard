For example, tools like Runable, V0, and Bubble are changing how fast people can go from idea to working product without heavy setup. The speed of iteration is becoming more important than the individual model quality. Also agree with Claude and ChatGPT being strong defaults. Most people end up using multiple models depending on the task rather than sticking to one. The real advantage now comes from combining tools effectively, not just choosing the “best” one.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** I’m a non-developer using LLMs for structured, metadata-heavy workflows (literature reviews, lecture prep, Obsidian). Claude impressed me at first, but I encountered workflow shortcuts and vault instability over time. After testing the new Codex Mac app on GPT Pro, I found it more predictable and compliant with strict step-by-step processes. This is about workflow fit, not model superiority.\n\n---\n\nI’m not a developer. I use LLMs primarily for literature reviews, structured lecture preparation, system organization, VPS setup, and managing a complex Obsidian vault with heavy metadata.\n\nFor a long time, I was a user of Claude (Opus/Max). Initially, it was impressive. But my workflows are strict, step-by-step, and highly defined. Over time, I noticed Claude would sometimes optimize the workflow rather than execute it exactly as written. Even with detailed instructions, it occasionally took shortcuts.\n\nThe breaking point for me was Obsidian vault stability. I experienced miswritten front matter, invented tags, and gradual structural drift. I kept expanding the instruction files to add guardrails, but increasing complexity seemed to reduce stability. Simplifying the vault structure didn’t fully solve it. Heavy workflow sessions also quickly consumed the Max quota.\n\nAfter the release of the new Codex Mac app, I decided to test it on the GPT Pro plan.\n\nWhat stood out:\n\n1. It respects explicitly defined workflows. When constraints are clear, it follows them.\n2. It adjusts quickly when corrected and stays within the structure.\n3. It proactively suggests system-level improvements (e.g., weekly vault health checks, metadata validation).\n4. It documents its actions extensively, which makes multi-session continuation easier.\n5. It performs reliably even with a minimal Agent MD configuration.\n\nFor literature review pipelines and structured planning, this predictability matters. I need a model that consistently executes predefined processes, rather than compressing or optimizing them away.\n\nTo be fair, Claude remains strong in writing and can feel more natural stylistically in some contexts. This isn’t a “Claude vs. Codex” claim. It’s more about workflow fit. For my use case, Codex currently feels more controllable and stable for long-horizon, metadata-heavy systems.\n\nIt’s not flawless. It still makes simple mistakes. The difference, in my experience, is that those errors are usually local and easy to correct, rather than structural.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach complex, structured workflows with either system, especially outside pure coding use cases.",

I've found that even Gemini, when given enough context, can really help manage a project end to end. example I'll feed it the prerequisites of a client solution, then ask as many questions as possible to prepare for a workshop and make sure the need is clearly scoped. It works well, but Gemini has become quite lazy with shorter and less detailed outputs\n\nI'm interested in Claude Code for its plan mode, skills and overall structure. But curious- for this kind of use case (project scoping, requirement analysis, workshop prep), would you say Codex is the better option?",

Generate clarification questions grouped by category  \n5. Produce a clean workshop agenda draft  \n\nWhen I give that as a procedural workflow, it tends to follow it very literally and consistently. That’s where I noticed the difference — less “reinterpretation,” more step-by-step execution.\n\nHypothetically, where Claude has struggled for me is when it optimizes at the reasoning level rather than executing the workflow literally. For example, in a literature pipeline, I might first generate an AI-produced literature review from a core set of papers. Then I expand the corpus by collecting additional papers and creating detailed notes and annotations. I explicitly define a separate step: “generate a concept map using the existing review plus these new notes and annotations.”\n\nAs new sources and annotations are introduced, the concept map should evolve structurally. However, Claude sometimes assumes the map would largely replicate the existing review and either compresses or skips the step. From its perspective, it’s avoiding redundancy. From mine, it’s bypassing a required artifact — since the added annotations are meant to reshape the conceptual structure, not merely restate it.\nThat distinction matters in strict workflows: I don’t want the model deciding whether a step is logically redundant. I want it to execute every defined artifact, even if they look related.\n\nIf your scoping process relies on templates and repeatable structure, Codex may feel more controllable. If you prefer fast conversational back-and-forth exploration, Claude Code might feel more fluid.\n\nFor structured project definition specifically, I’d lean on Codex.",

I actually was going to prototype a workflow using the personal UI, because I found it more comfortable than my API (stupid thing to do). Maybe it’s because you’re not on a business account, yet doing business work? You can pay 60$/month for a business account!\n\nI wish there was a way to reach actual customer service to confirm this is the problem. Hope you get back to building soon!",

This was to convert an 12-page poorly scanned document to markdown and to remove headers, footers, renumber the footnotes and ensure that OCR artefacts were resolved so that the textual context remained constant. Gave it another go after the failure and it completed the task within five hours.",

Over the last few weeks (February 2026), there has been a surge in reports from users, particularly those on GPT-5.2 and GPT-Plus, experiencing exactly what you described: a sudden inability to parse familiar PDFs or \"hallucinating\" that information isn't there when it clearly is.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from a recent backend shift in how OpenAI handles document \"vision\" versus traditional text extraction.\n\n# Why this is happening now\n\n* **\"Vision-First\" over OCR:** Recent updates have leaned more heavily on the model's **Vision capabilities** (treating the PDF like an image) rather than a direct OCR text-extraction layer. This often results in \"fuzzier\" reading, especially for dense text, tables, or non-standard fonts.\n* **The 3-Hour Cache Window:** OpenAI has reportedly shortened the \"active\" window for uploaded files. Even if you've used the same static set for months, the \"indexing\" of those files can expire mid-session, leading the model to claim it can't \"see\" things anymore.\n* **Safety Filter Tightening:** There was a significant backend push around **February 5, 2026**, that tightened \"copyright and data sovereignty\" filters. This has caused the model to become much more \"shy\" about quoting or extracting verbatim text from certain PDF structures to avoid reproducing proprietary content.",

      "text": "I'm fascinated by updates to the more agentic 'modes' inside foundational chat apps, and Deep Research across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. is one of my favorite examples.\n\nWe can see the core LLMs stretch in different ways in deep research (DR) modes, tasked with more expansive research, long-horizon task planning, and other agentic behavior.\n\nSince OpenAI recently updated their DR to be fueled by GPT-5.2, thought it'd be a good time to compare -- here are some interesting findings:\n\n**Finding 1: how \"interpretative\" an LLM gets really matters**\n\nMy prompt:\n\n>*I’ve long been curious about what seems like Starlink’s very long lead in the satellite telecom and internet market. It seems like a very dubious thing to have one company hold so much necessary capacity for the world.*\n\n>*Can you do a deep exploration of the market -- emerging competitors, nearest in-market alternatives, differences in capability and feature sets, and the nuances throughout? Would love an analysis of this market and what it will look like over the next few years.*\n\nWhen I was reading the response from all of the models, I noticed how much I cared about the interpretation of my prompt. Perplexity, Kimi, MiniMax, and GLM-5 were all *fine*, but all quite surface level. We got textbook-style factsheets from these models. Gemini fell to this, too.\n\nClaude and ChatGPT, whether through strength of the core models or the system instructions behind their research modes, both tried to come to some *conclusion* or forecast about Starlink. There's a sense to which it's a failure mode for these deep research products to come with a fact sheet where the next step is just a lot of homework on the user. Whether or not the user is going to do a lot of homework, we want there to be that initial interpretation using all the evidence the model just got. \n\nFor that reason, it was actually [GPT-5.2 Pro](https://chatgpt.com/share/6993170c-3efc-8011-8874-acaddbb9ec84) that won this round. Although it's not technically a dedicated deep research mode, it's a mode that does a tremendous amount of diligent research, and its synthesis and willingness to do analysis is what made its response so powerful. \n\n**Finding 2: parallel subagents are really going to matter for fact-gathering**\n\nAnother one of my prompts was about gathering a lot of admissions data.\n\n>*I need a comprehensive, well-cited breakdown of international versus domestic enrollment at top US universities, split by year and by level. We may need to search institutional archives, fact books, or registrar reports. Schools: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Yale, Columbia, University of Chicago. Let’s grab: current international student % at each school, sub split by 1974-1975, 1994-1995, and 2023-2024 (or nearest years where we can find reliable data), sub split in those zones by undergrad versus grad.*\n\nAlmost all of the models struggled with this one, whether it was ChatGPT's Deep Research not dealing well with archival formats or Gemini kind of getting distracted from the specific data. Claude got close, but... the dark horse was Kimi ([response](https://www.kimi.com/share/19c669e1-b612-8651-8000-0000250dc3f6))! Kimi 2.5 has an Agent Swarm mode that allows the main agent to spin up several parallel subagents, all tasked with doing a particular portion of the research. And then, as those subagents either succeed or fail, the orchestrating agent could decide to retry certain portions of the research. \n\nSo in this case, each subagent was assigned a particular school, and when the proper data wasn't there, new subagents were spun up to try again or try a different approach.\n\n[Kimi subagents](https://preview.redd.it/745y32rwzwjg1.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=e48675b2c785392fc135319e463431c7b7ed69e3)\n\nWith subagents, the nice thing is that each thread doesn't get exhausted by being long-running and doesn't get distracted by the next task it knows it needs to do. This sort of focus is actually quite mechanistically useful in getting it to really try to get a final result. \n\n**Finding 3: the agent should still be opinionated**\n\nAnother one of my prompts had to do with some pseudo science:\n\n>\n\nI think Gemini exhibited the failure mode here. Its response told me about sleep chronotypes, but it engaged too much as if Dr. Breus had a point or was right, or it wanted to just describe to me the reasons he believed what he believed. \n\nI far preferred Claude and ChatGPT, who very much characterized his framework as being pop science, not validated by literature. They still described it to me, but they gave me that conclusion and then taught me a whole lot else about sleep and the validated portions of sleep chronotypes.\n\nThis is obviously related to finding 1 in a big way, and the winner for me wound up being [ChatGPT's Deep Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eC7GqntkaBOl1eavtPVbUd4hla0s-Dzz/view?usp=sharing), because it both challenged Breus while teaching me about the subject matter.\n\n**I ran 5 tests and have full links to the chats/results from all models, plus my conclusion re: the best deep research product today** [over here](https://aimuscle.substack.com/p/which-ai-deep-research-is-the-best)**.**\n\nCurious if y'all rely on the deep research modes much, when you decide to use them, if you have a favorite, etc.?\n\n",

I understand that there are subtle differences in the models hit through either means (temperature, thinking cycles, routing, etc.) as well as the obvious difference of the API missing the web/desktop's inherent system prompt. However, assuming you can find decent model configuration and write a decent system prompt to contextualize your \"day-to-day\" prompts, will the API approach being as performant as the web/desktop app?\n\nThis is just motivated by my frustrations with OpenAI's (and Claude's and Gemini's fwiw) web and desktop interfaces and a desire to build my own dedicated desktop harness. Imo each native harness does a handful of things of right and a whole lot of things wrong.",

But as soon as I generate an API key and try and use auth via API key (through a codex exec command as well), it says Codex 5.3 is not an available model.\n\nI generated a new API key brand new, and right off the cuff it doesn't seem to have access for Codex 5.3 via API key. Is there a setting I must change to make it available? I found some unverifiable slop articles that said \"Codex 5.3 was coming soon to API\" but nothing I would trust.\n\nIs it simply not available yet through API key, or am I messing up somewhere along the way?",
