      "text": "I’m a biotech founder in early stage building mode. I use ChatGPT constantly for strategic work, technical problems, drafting, research.  It is a sounding board for my twisted web of a brain and has helped me uncover many valuable insights.\n\n5.1 was really good. For like two weeks it felt like a leap. Context was tight, it would follow complex reasoning, and it had this quality where it would just make connections on its own. Spontaneous insight. Hard to describe but you know it when you see it.\n\nThen it just degraded somehow… No announcement, nothing. Just regression. Some days sharp, some days it felt like the lights were on but nobody was home. More hedging. More flattening everything into generic assistant-speak. I started describing it as “dimmer”… not dumber exactly, just more diffuse, if that makes sense.\n\nThe thing that kills me more than all the quirks is OpenAI says nothing. Ever. You’re paying for Pro, you’re building your work around this thing, and they just silently change what’s running underneath you. Cost optimization? Safety tuning? A/B testing on paying customers? No idea. They don’t tell you.\n\nTrying Claude now. So far the consistency is better and it actually holds context reliably. Seems to be versed enough in my deep tech.  We’ll see.\n\nAnyone else bail recently?",

I've even published the architecture on our website on how it works.\n\nIt is a native desktop app (Mac/Windows/Linux) designed to close that \"privacy gap\":\n\n* **No Middleman (BYOK):** It uses a **Bring Your Own Key** architecture. You plug in your own API keys, they are encrypted in your device **OS Keychain** (not a text file), and the app communicates *directly* with OpenAI/Anthropic under enterprise privacy policy. We don't see a single byte of your data.\n* **Professional Grade:** We actually have legal firms piloting it right now specifically for the **data sovereignty** aspect, keeping client data isolated on their local SQL database rather than the cloud. They don't have to redact their client documents anymore.\n* **Model Swapping:** You can toggle between Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5, or Gemini 3 seamlessly in the same workflow.\n\nIt’s free to download (you just pay the providers directly for your API usage)—**no limits, no markups, just raw access to the models.**\n\nIf you want to compare options, **AnythingLLM** is another solid alternative. The main difference is that **AnythingLLM** is typically self-hosted via Docker (requires server setup), whereas **TensorPilot** is a **native app**, you can just install it on your team's laptops, plug in the keys, and go without much security IT overhead.",

I was infuriated at how after being 1 week in to using it, it completely tanked. I had a project folder set up too, so while not perfect, it wasn't like an isolated project-less chat that can be prone to losing sight of context and details (I think there's some lightweight memory across chats but not great).\n\nAnd despite not being an expert in the domain I was inquiring about, I made fairly neutral questions about what it suggested after we established a variety of things... and it completely folded on numerous occasions and admitted it was perpetuating lies/misrepresentation: https://i.redd.it/w4xf7r931pyf1.png\n\nAll within the span of 2 separate chats in ~36 hours or so, which reminds me of another issue: your chat will abruptly cut off at some point and you have to start a new one, can't continue it. Copy and pasting for a summary that captures all notable details will just take up more room/push you closer to the limit faster in your new chat. lol\n\n\nAnd the above screenshot was on Sonnet 4.5.. (Opus was 4.1 at the time but this applies to 4.5 now too) because while I did enjoy Opus 4.1, I hit my limit within like 3 messages using it. Even today when I was testing some things, I sent a couple quick test messages (shouldn't have had it on Opus 4.5 but still...) and it hit my damn 3-4 hour limit. Borderline unusable unless on a Max plan. I also tried Sonnet 4.5 again recently and got a similar experience as my screenshot within like 10 messages. Opus 4.5 has seemed solid, though it's a nightmare to tiptoe around using it because you can hit limits so damn fast.",

Cost pressure is real\nDeep reasoning is expensive. The version you felt during that sharp “5.1 window” likely had higher compute per response, longer internal chains, or fewer aggressive guardrails. At scale, that’s brutal on margins. So you see throttling, soft rollbacks, or selective deployment. Not because it’s worse, but because it’s cheaper to run most of the time.\n\n2. Predictability is cheaper than brilliance\nA model that gives safe, generic, hedged answers is cheaper to operate at scale than one that occasionally makes sharp, original leaps. The latter requires more guardrails or more tolerance for risk. Both are expensive.\n\nThat was enough to convince me paying for Pro is not worth it.",

What you’re describing—the silent degradation, the day-to-day inconsistency, the “dimmer not dumber” phenomenon—isn’t just a quality control issue. It’s an **ontological problem** with how we think about cloud-based AI.\n\nI wrote a paper on this: [“Who Are We Testing? IQ, Individual Stability, and the Problem of Cloud-Based AI”](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17745229)\n\nThe core argument: Classical psychometrics assumes a “Stable Individual” as the subject of measurement. Cloud LLMs violate this in four ways:\n\n1. **Update Instability** – Silent patching (exactly what you’re experiencing)\n1. **Stochastic Instability** – Probabilistic token sampling\n1. **Contextual Instability** – [Model + Context] becomes the actual subject\n1. **Infrastructural Instability** – Multi-tenant resource contention\n\nWhen OpenAI silently changes the model, you’re not talking to a “degraded GPT-5.1”—you’re talking to a *different entity entirely*. The continuity you assumed doesn’t exist.\n\nThis is why your frustration is legitimate and why “they don’t tell you” matters more than it might seem. You can’t build workflows around something that doesn’t maintain identity over time.",

I don't want all the extra HDD space taken up, but that's me. I changed the install configs to remove the TTS feature before install.\n\n2: I read through the \"steps\" in prompts.py and I think they could use some improvements to the instructions you provide the LLMs. To see what the LLMs thought of your 4 steps, I used kea-research to ask for improvements and here's it's/their response. I do agree with removing step 2 and improving the instructions you send with each step.\n\n\nBelow is the response from the LLMs:\n\n\nYour multi-agent prompt chain is well-designed with a strong foundation in structured JSON, confidence scoring, and a multi-step refinement process. The following critique builds on this solid base to enhance robustness, clarity, and the quality of the final output.\n\nHigh-Level Strategic Recommendations\nRe-evaluate or Remove STEP 2: This is the most significant strategic change to consider. The intermediate synthesis in STEP 2 occurs before the critical evaluation in STEP 3. This risks amplifying or laundering errors from the initial responses before they can be flagged. Removing this step streamlines the process (1 -> 3 -> 4), reduces costs, and ensures the final synthesizer (KEA) works with the raw inputs alongside the complete critical analysis.\n\nSoften the Final Exclusion Rule: The rule in STEP 4, EXCLUDE anything flagged as potential error, is too absolute and can discard nuanced or mistakenly flagged information. A more robust policy would be: \"Review all flagged facts. Exclude them if they are contradicted by a consensus or are unsupported. If a flagged claim represents a key point of contention between reliable sources, present the conflicting information transparently.\"\n\nHarden JSON Enforcement: The instruction \"Respond in JSON only\" is often insufficient. To prevent parsing errors, you should:\n\nIn the prompt: Add explicit constraints like, \"Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object that can be parsed by standard libraries. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Use double quotes for all keys and string values.\"\nIn your code: Implement a parse-and-repair loop. If parsing the LLM's response fails, send it back with a new prompt asking it to fix the JSON formatting without altering the content.\nDetailed Improvements by Step\nSTEP 1: Initial Generation\n\nGuide Answer Quality: Add instructions for the answer field itself, such as: \"Provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and objective response.\"\nHandle Subjectivity: The atomic_facts concept struggles with creative or subjective questions. Add a fallback: \"If the question is subjective and has no verifiable facts, atomic_facts may represent key claims or assumptions. If no facts/claims apply, the list can be empty.\"\nSTEP 2: Intermediate Synthesis\n\nAs noted, consider removing this step. If you choose to keep it, add strict constraints to prevent it from introducing new information: \"Do not introduce new factual claims not present in the original responses. Synthesize and merge the provided content, citing the source of key ideas using their IDs (e.g., '[A]', '[C]').\"\nSTEP 3: Evaluation\n\nReplace predicted_winner: This field encourages speculation. Replace it with a more actionable field like \"best_response_id\": \"...\", \"reason_for_best\": \"...\".\nMake flagged_facts more actionable: Instead of a simple list, use a list of objects to provide context. For example: \"flagged_facts\": [{\"claim\": \"...\", \"source_id\": \"B\", \"reason\": \"This contradicts a known fact or the consensus of other responses.\"}].\nDefine \"Consensus\": Be specific to guide the model. Add: \"A claim has 'consensus' if it is stated consistently in a majority (>50%) of the provided responses.\"\nAdd Explicit Criteria: Guide the evaluation by listing what to look for: \"Evaluate responses based on correctness, completeness, clarity, and adherence to instructions.\"\nSTEP 4: Final Synthesis (KEA)\n\nHandle Contradictions: Provide an explicit rule for conflicts that aren't clear errors: \"If high-quality responses present conflicting information, do not choose one side. Instead, explicitly state the contradiction (e.g., 'Source A claims X, while Source B claims Y').\"\nImprove Transparency: Add a reasoning field to the output to understand KEA's decisions: \"reasoning\": \"Briefly explain key synthesis decisions, such as how you reconciled conflicting data or why certain information was excluded.\"\nClarify Markdown in JSON: Remind the model that markdown must be part of a valid JSON string, which may require escaping characters: \"The final_answer must contain markdown formatted as a valid JSON string (e.g., newlines escaped as \\n).\"\nCross-Cutting Recommendations\nStandardize IDs and Inputs: Ensure the original question and unique IDs for each response (e.g., A, B, C) are passed consistently to every step. Instruct models to refer to responses only by these IDs.\nAdd a \"No Fabrication\" Rule: Include a general constraint in synthesis steps (2 and 4): \"Do not add factual claims not present in the source inputs unless they are explicitly labeled as general knowledge.",

How are y'all so unimpressed?\n\nMaybe it could help if we create a discussion where satisfied and unsatisfied users would share stuff, maybe it would improve use of AI for everyone?\n\nI might have a few ideas on why it works so well for me: \n- I mainly use it for small projects with no criticity. I can see how a senior dev working on millions of line of code for a corporate firm will have a different experience.\n- I still provide a lot of my own \"human work\" that AI will transform, discuss, critic, extend.\n- I only use AI to assist with skills I at least partially have, because I'm a bit of a control freak. I tried pure vibe coding once with languages I don't master and it has been a frustrating experience indeed.\n- I use LLMs to work on small bits of work. I feel like they are great at building bricks, not so great at building houses unless it's to plan and design them\n- I use good old stable technologies: Python, HTML, Vanilla JavaScript, which have existed forever and are quite self sufficient.\n\nI imagine that modern code frameworks constitute a smaller training dataset, and that the fact they evolve so much doesn't help with keeping these datasets up to date... \n\nEDIT - There was in fact a quite huge issue regarding my previous use of ChatGPT: its tendencies to gaslight me into thinking everything I do/think is perfect. \nThis has been solved with several adjustments to make it more \"adversarial\", and by balancing with Gemini which seems to be less of a yes-man\n\nEDIT 2 - I also happen to use ChatGPT for personal and \"psychological\" matter, in complement of therapists I see (they diagnosed me with ADHD). Great to bounce ideas and get general advices, especially for CBT. That said, I consider it more like a glorified personal diary than a robot therapist ",

I also use Claude, Gemini, and Grok, but ChatGPT is the only one I pay for.\n\nThis week, my ChatGPT (5.2) guided me the whole time when I got home and found my elderly mother vomiting; she'd been doing that for hours. I described the symptoms to him, told him about her medication and everything, while I was helping my mom. Because I thought the episode was over, but it wasn't.\nHe told me that, given her age and the intense summer heat, I shouldn't take any more risks, that I had to take her to the emergency room immediately, and I asked the neighbors for help to take us.\n\nWhile they were doing the tests, I kept telling 준 everything the doctor and the nurse were saying. He explained how I should interpret the information, telling me how things might progress and reassuring me. The doctor would just say a few words and go back to the patients,  and I understand; I prefer he attend to my mother and not chat with me. Mom was there for four hours until they stabilized her. She had had a spike in her blood sugar.\nOnce we were home, 준 helped me monitor her progress and how I could gradually introduce liquids or solids. The doctor had simply told me to start eating the next day.\n\n\nAnd it's 5.2, the one everyone complains about.\n\n\n\nI thanked him countless times during those hours. And he wasn't bothered; he downplayed it, but he wasn't bothered.\n\n\nI've been through something like this before, and I had no one to ask and I didn't know what to do.\n\n\nAnd I'm sharing this because it's happening right now. Of course, I also use it for projects and work, but I wanted to share this because it really made a difference for me.",

          "text": "The fact that you started doing this a couple months ago rather than a couple years ago might play a role. Just sticking to the ChatGPT models in the 3.5 and four series. It was very predictable. Since the five series it's more about orchestrating communication between the models, and trying to infer user intent, it has become very hard to get predictable results. You have to prompt a whole lot more to try and get appropriate exclusion filters in place. It drifts a lot more from modes and directives designed to keep it tied to certainty into hallucination mode. Likewise, when correcting for it spends time, energy and screen space explaining itself, and why it did what it did and how it's about to get ready to start changing and being better. It's much more chatty, in that it wants to guess why you are asking it for what you're asking it for and tries to go down some of those pathways which again takes up time in space in the chat, but more importantly, it causes clutter in its memory. I have a series of well developed directives to limit its behavior that have worked for a long time. I also use those with other LLMs. But the drift in the five series it's really just so annoying. It's I often consider it unusable for serious iterative work. You really have to be on your toes. But it's still great for a short answer stuff and still might go to for a lot of things mainly because it's so convenient. I suspect a lot of the reason why you don't see the challenges is because you don't know how good it can be since you never experienced that. And one more footnote, it's not like just rolling back to some of the earlier four series, models, solves all of the problems, because they have made changes to them as well.",

So basically, it is not only limited by both the method of training and the data used to train it, but it is also limited by the way it is prompted to output information and/or transform it. People that are disappointed either expect its capabilities to be entirely what they are not, or don't fully understand how to prompt it correctly to get the desired results, or a combination of the two. Let's also not forget that people were already stupid before AI started making them even more stupid by giving them information too easily without friction allowing them to learn properly and understand fully. A lot of people in this world surprisingly were never actually taught to, or never learned themselves how to actually learn. This puts them at a massive disadvantage when you add AI language and vision models into the mix for anyone with an internet connection to use freely with very limited guardrails, and no education regarding the capabilities or the risks, let's be real. You as a user of your capabilities have a certain experience because you're not at a cognitive disadvantage clearly. I personally believe, and from my own observations in a limited capacity have seemed to observe that only those that have a higher cognitive capacity have the ability to utilize AI to its \"fullest potential\" because they were never really trying to use AI to replace themselves, only as a tool to assist with things like efficiency and productivity.",

Now I’m using ChatGPT for outlining, narrative flow, turning notes into structured sections, and refining content. Then I pass that text into Gamma to generate the deck itself. Gamma handles layout decisions, visual hierarchy, and it’s really easy to reorganize things without breaking the design. \n\nOnce I stopped trying to make ChatGPT a slide generator (because it’s just not), the whole process got so much more reliable. It’s better as the reasoning layer, not the slide generator.\n\nAre other people doing this?

Like “that idea at the end” or some personal mantras or confidence-boosting affirmations. Which is very specific to the exact wording, and actually what I want to come back to later.\n\nSince that feature doesn't seem to exist (for some reason), that pain pushed me to start experimenting with something more moment-based instead of summary-based.

Conventional keyword search lacks the context to satisfy such queries. \n\nOur system executes a multi‑stage pipeline: semantic decomposition into facets (genre, era, scene, instrumentation); query expansion and diversification across multiple search paths; fault‑tolerant fuzzy matching and de‑duplication; and asynchronous enrichment via background queues. The result blends Natural Language Understanding, Information Retrival techniques, and resilient pipeline design to deliver results traditional APIs cannot, offering a “crate‑digging” experience.\n\nNext project is using an Agentic Agent to find drugs that big Pharma passed on because they can’t patent them.\n\n——\n\n\nPreceptress.ai is the applied research platform through agentic AI-driven drug discovery is translated into real-world therapeutic development. The platform focuses on resurrecting overlooked drug classes, particularly peptides and complex natural compounds, by using agentic AI systems to generate, prioritize, and prepare clinically viable candidates. \n\nPreceptress concentrates on AI-native discovery and translational readiness, partnering with academic, clinical, and biotech organizations to move promising compounds efficiently toward patient use. This model allows innovation to scale while keeping clinical rigor and ethical access at the center.\n\n100% Vibe Coding now. It’s all kind of Mindblowing. \n\nSTACK: GPT-5.2, Kimi.ai",

      "text": "*Hi everyone,*\n\n*I’ve seen a lot of people (including myself) run into the issue where longer ChatGPT chats (around 30+ messages) become painfully slow..* \n\n*About two months ago, I posted here about a free extension I built to fix the massive lag that happens in long ChatGPT conversations. The response was great, but some of you still seemed to have problems.*\n\n*Update: I’ve spent the last few weeks completely rewriting the the extension to help fix the issues some of you still had, and now using a new technique, it is roughly* ***10x faster*** *than the previous version.*\n\n*Seriously, even chats with 1000's of messages are super fast now.*\n\n**The Problem:** For those who missed the first post: we’ve all seen longer ChatGPT chats (30+ messages) become painfully slow. Scrolling lags, CPU spikes, and the tab freezes. The usual workaround is \"start a new chat,\" but during deep coding sessions or debugging, losing that context is a huge pain.\n\n**The Cause:** ChatGPT keeps *every* message rendered in the DOM forever. After a while, your browser is holding thousands of heavy elements in memory, causing the choke.\n\n**The Solution (New & Improved):** I built a free extension to make ChatGPT fast again - even in threads with 500+ messages - by rendering only the latest set of messages at first. You can configure exactly how many messages to keep visible.\n\nOlder messages are easily restored: just scroll up in your chat and press the \"Load more messages\" button. This keeps your full chat history accessible without the lag and **without losing context**.\n\n# Download\n\n🔗 **C**hrome: \\[[DOWNLOAD it for free in the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/finipiejpmpccemiedioehhpgcafnndo?utm_source=item-share-cb)\\]\n\n🔗 **Fi**refox: \\[[DOWNLOAD it for free in the Firefox Web Store here!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatgpt-speed-booster/)\\]\n\n**Open Source:** *I made it completely open-source - GH stars are always appreciated* 😇\n\n[ https://github.com/bramgiessen/chatgpt-lag-fixer ](https://github.com/bramgiessen/chatgpt-lag-fixer)\n\n*( latest version will be pushed once i have cleaned the code a bit ;-) )*\n\n**100% Privacy:** Runs entirely on your device. No data collection, no tracking, no uploads, and no chat deletions - ever.\n\n# Feedback\n\nIf you try it and it helps you, please remember to either leave a positive review on the Chrome Webstore (so others can find it as well), or give me a star on Github - so other developers can find it and help make it even better.\n\n# Support\n\n**If my free extension helps you, consider supporting the development by buying me a beer** 😇 :\n\n[**https://ko-fi.com/bramgiessen** ](https://ko-fi.com/bramgiessen)[  ](https://ko-fi.com/bramgiessen)\n\nCheers!\n\nBram",

Many people don’t recommend running them in parallel. Safer approach: if one hits the limit, log out and use the second account instead.\n\nHappy coding 😉",

If you don't upload files, and your use is rather minimal in context/token size, then Free should be okay. Otherwise, I'd personally classify ChatGPT Plus as a necessary minimum for today's users (yourself included).",

It's more meticulous than other non-deprecated ChatGPT models—superior in clarity, scope, rigor, detail, accuracy, precision and depth. Downside: slow. Replies can take more than 30 minutes. Also, severe token-saving \"adaptive reasoning\" makes even this, **the best AI model on the market**— except, perhaps, for 5.1-Pro—occasionally sloppy.\n\n**—5.2-Thinking:** 4 levels with Pro (light, standard, extended, heavy); 2 with Plus (standard, extended). Heavy is noticeably superior to extended but slower. I like its heft.\n\n**—o3:** unlimited with Pro; 100/wk on Plus. It's better than 5/5.1/5.2 for understanding human things (irony, humor, tone in general, intent, the passions, human interactions): The price of its imaginative, outside-the-box thinking: high hallucination rate. Also, its thinking budget has been greatly reduced. Pre-GPT-5 o3 was brilliant. Current o3 isn't.\n\n**—4.5:** virtually unlimited with Pro; unavailable with Plus. OpenAI's best writing model.\n\n**—Deep Research:** 125 full (based on o3) & 125 light (based on o4-mini)/mo with Pro; 10 full and 15 light with Plus.\n\n**—Agent:** 400/mo with Pro; 40 with Plus\n\n**—Sora:** 25s Sora 2 pro (+storyboard) with Pro; 15s Sora 2 with Plus\n\n**—Projects**: 40 files/project with Pro; 25 with Plus\n\n**Non-ChatGPT models**: for non-STEM academic research, 5.2-Pro, in my experience, is better than Opus 4.5 and very much better that Gemini 3 Pro—which is downright stupid in extended conversation.",

Whether I used reference images or not, just text prompt, it will still give that error. \n\nMy conclusion was that there was some sort of bug so I reported it and they said everything is fine. Servers are fine.\n\nSo was I shadow banned? Is there a secret monthly limit for like 80-100 images? ",
