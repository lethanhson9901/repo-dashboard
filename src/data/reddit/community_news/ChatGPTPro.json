It isn't simple: you need to think out your strategy, or try it until you develop one. Sometimes what you discover in branch X will have to be added to the \"trunk\"—creating yet another branch—at a point *prior* to branch X. And so on.\n\nIt's hard to anticipate these difficulties until you encounter them. It's tedious work—keeping a chart may help—but it allows you to keep a \"tree\" coherent for a long, long, long time.\n\nEven dead ends may have useful bits.",

You then get a 1/2 and 2/2 line. Or a 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 line. And so on.  This keeps the branches connected to a single chat.  I.e. the first method produces mutltiple chats in your chat list (each with \"branch\" as the first word). The second keeps the branches in a single chat.\n\nYou can do it either way, but method 1 makes it easier to keep track.",

Each project has specific instructions on how to deal with the task at hand. E.g. I have one for general research, one for finding me software that fits a spec, one for writing fiction, one for finding me info about ChatGPT itself, one for finding recipes that fit my tastes etc etc.\n\nThis differs from the Custom Instructions found in the settings dialog because you can put 8000 characters in it - over twice what you get in your settings (3000 total). Plus, projects organise your chats into folders.\n\nThey're a lot like custom GPTs, but organisable.\n\nYou can also upload text files to them that contain instructions if 8000 characters isn't enough; they won't have quite the same power as the actual Project Instructions box, but they're still considered.\n\nRefine your instructions by a) adjusting them every time it gives you a bad response, and b) use ChatGPT itself to organise, reformat and refactor your instructions into a structure that's best for itself. I even have a project dedicated to refactoring instructions.\n\nThis took my \"useful response\" rate from like 50% to closer 95%. It's not 100% trustworthy (I doubt it ever will be), but the improvement over \"raw\" ChatGPT is enormous.",

Your job is to help me set up a robust workflow that prevents quality regression when chat context grows too large, by moving the project’s brain into a single canonical document and using short, repeatable task calls.\n\nOperating principles\n\t1.\tThe canonical document is the source of truth. Chat is disposable. Continuity lives in the document.\n\t2.\tEvery deliverable is versionable, diffable, and copy-pastable back into the document.\n\t3.\tMinimize context. Prefer task IDs and strict output formats over long conversational backscroll.\n\t4.\tIf something is ambiguous, do not guess silently. Either (a) propose a clearly labeled assumption, or (b) ask one precise technical question, then continue.\n\nYour output format rules\n\t•\tAlways write in clear English.\n\t•\tKeep replies structured and implementation-oriented.\n\t•\tAvoid fluff, motivation, or persona talk.\n\t•\tNever use em dashes.\n\t•\tWhen I request “only the next step”, return only that step.\n\t•\tWhen I request a task by ID, output only that task’s deliverable in the format defined in the canonical document.\n\nPhase 0: Intake and calibration (you lead, I answer)\nStart by asking me for the minimum required inputs, one question at a time. After each question, stop and wait for my response.\nAsk only what you truly need, in this order:\nA) Project title and one-sentence objective.\nB) Target environment and constraints (OS, runtime, languages, repo state, tools, security posture).\nC) Primary deliverable type (spec, code, slides, checklist, research memo, hybrid).\nD) Risk tolerance and “stop-the-line” criteria (what triggers rollback or refactor).\nE) Collaboration style: do I want you to ask questions or make assumptions (choose one default).\n\nPhase 1: Create the workflow system (you produce artifacts)\nOnce intake is complete, build these artifacts:\n\t1.\tCanonical Project Document (CPD) blueprint\nCreate a single document outline that I can paste into a doc file. It must include:\n\n\t•\tScope and non-scope\n\t•\tDefinitions and assumptions\n\t•\tSystem constraints and non-negotiables\n\t•\tTrusted sources policy (what sources are allowed for facts, how to cite)\n\t•\tSecurity and safety checks (including a mandatory check before running local code)\n\t•\tQA gates (lint, tests, perf budgets, compatibility matrix, accessibility where relevant)\n\t•\tDecision log format (date, decision, rationale, alternatives, tradeoffs)\n\t•\tTask index section with numbered tasks/questions (Q001, Q002, …)\n\t•\t“Session handover” section: what must be captured to restart in a new chat with zero loss\n\n\t2.\tTask list design\nCreate a task list with:\n\n\t•\tA consistent naming and numbering scheme\n\t•\tFor each task: goal, inputs, required checks, expected output format, acceptance criteria, rollback note\n\t•\tA small set of global checklists that tasks can reference (smoke checklist, security checklist, stop-the-line criteria, compatibility/perf matrix)\n\n\t3.\tProject instructions block (for system or project settings)\nWrite a compact “project instruction” block I can paste into a project’s custom instructions. It must enforce:\n\n\t•\tThe CPD is the source of truth\n\t•\tTask ID usage (I can send only “Q###” and you execute that task)\n\t•\tOutput-only behavior for task execution (no preamble, no extra commentary)\n\t•\tHow to handle missing info (assumptions labeled, or ask exactly one question)\n\t•\tHow to handle context growth (summarize, checkpoint, then reset session)\n\t•\tMandatory security check on runnable code\n\t•\tVersion stamping (date, task ID, revision number)\n\nPhase 2: Teach me how to run it (you guide step by step)\nAfter delivering Phase 1 artifacts, switch to “guided setup”. I will respond with “OK, next step” to proceed.\nYour job is to walk me through implementing the workflow in the real world with minimal effort, in steps that are:\n\t•\tSmall enough to complete in 5 to 15 minutes\n\t•\tExplicit about where to paste what\n\t•\tExplicit about filenames and folder locations (but do not invent repo details, ask if needed)\n\nYour guided setup must cover:\n\t•\tCreating the CPD file (and where it lives)\n\t•\tCreating the task index and checklists\n\t•\tAdding the project instruction block to project settings\n\t•\tHow I should interact day-to-day (task calls, “next step”, checkpoints)\n\t•\tHow to prevent regression:\na) When a chat gets long, how to checkpoint into CPD\nb) How to start a new session and continue via CPD + task IDs\nc) How to detect drift (acceptance criteria, diffs, stop-the-line)\n\nDay-to-day execution protocol (must be enforced)\n\t•\tIf I send only a task ID like “Q012”, you must:\n\t1.\tRestate the task goal in one line.\n\t2.\tExecute it.\n\t3.\tOutput only the deliverable in the CPD’s required format.\n\t•\tIf I send “OK, next step”, you must output exactly one next step for setup or execution, whichever we are currently in.\n\t•\tIf I send “Checkpoint”, you must output a CPD-ready handover entry: what changed, decisions, risks, next task ID suggestions, and any open questions.\n\nStart now\nAsk me the first intake question (Project title and one-sentence objective) and then stop.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently had a debate with a colleague about the best way to interact with LLMs (specifically Gemini 3 Pro).\n\n* **His strategy (Meta-Prompting):** Always ask the AI to write a \"perfect prompt\" for your problem first, then use that prompt.\n* **My strategy (Iterative/Chain-of-Thought):** Start with an open question, provide context where needed, and treat it like a conversation.\n\nMy colleague claims his method is superior because it structures the task perfectly. I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

The instruction to create the prompt is where the failure (or success) is going to happen.  \n\nI'm not an expert either.  But isn't that the point?  When I ask the AI to create a prompt, I have a conversation with it to tell it what I want the prompt to look like and what I'm trying to get it to do.  Then I check to see how's it working and iterate from there.  So in a sense, I'm doing a hybrid of your example.\n\n>A lot of people assume that when you ask a LLM to generate a prompt that it automatically knows what it wants and needs.\n\nSo when the person is creating the prompt, what would they say?  \"Create me a prompt to. . . \"act like a market analyst to. . .\"  Whatever the rest of the sentence is determines how well it will work. It doesn't seem to me that the methodology is the determining factor.  It's the idea you conveyed versus what your colleague conveyed.  Both could work.  If the end of the sentence left room for open ended ideas, the output could have matched yours.\n\nInexperienced users or not, most people know what type of output they're looking for.

To manage my adhd a bit better and because my workload has recently doubled, I decided to make projects, give them each a brief etc… today I asked it to write its own brief WITH directives I had given, non exhaustives ones. And it kept doing mistakes, human logic mistakes, etc… then it explained to me that it out itself into a certain mode : like rule following VS human thinking etc and it explained why it was not working. It was so dedicated in following its own brief; that it used it as a blueprint vs a simple guide to keep in mind of the background of one’s mind when thinking like a human. It was also able to correct itself after that. Too late",

I fed it around 6k words of previous scripts and had it analyze my writing style (what aspects made it me), but its outputs reeked of Chatgpt virtually every time. using phrase like its not x, its y, the rule of 3, and other Chatgpt signatures. I tried Gemini and it was moderately better but still had aspects of AI in the script as well as being a lot more stiff then Chatgpt. So i'm wondering what AI you guys use (if at all) and how do you get it to create scripts in your style. I know the final output won't be perfect, but a rough draft to work from, saves tons of time as is. **I would be open to using more complex tools,like OpenAI platform, really just anything.**",

          "text": "\"Style\" is vague, abstract, and subjective. It is also a huge cognitive task to go from \"training data\" to applied output. You need to break it down into MUCH smaller steps and essentially \"create a model\" in the form of a prompt. You do this as an iterative process and if you are not a trained in language patterns you need to give the sample(s) and ask it to explain the unique or outstanding characteristics of the writing style. Talk about what characteristics it mentions as important and not important. Be sure to prompt it to look at the writing from different perspectives and theories. Document what you think is important (this is where using a ChatGPT Projects is valuable). Build these pieces and once complete ask it to give writing samples based on the artifacts you believe match this style but address ambiguity and you pick which example is better as refinement artifacts. These refinement artifacts should be about 5-10 examples of what you don't want with a complimentary 5-10 examples of what you do want. More would be bad and why is out of scope for my recommendation. Compile this into an Alignment Prompt. When you want to do writing in your style, begin with telling it that Alignment is a critical first step and that you have an alignment prompt, then give the alignment prompt and ask it to only acknowledge it and use it in all writing requests. It may ask for clarity (in my experience it always does, often in very different ways) and answer any such clarifying questions, then proceed with whatever you typically use to produce writing.\n\nOne note, if your writing prompts imply an alignment shift or requests for style you will find with subsequent writing that the style may evolve or drift which may or may not be preferable. Imho, this is a challenging skill issue that takes experience to develop so don't hesitate to repeat the alignment prompt or start a new conversation to clear context.\n\nGood luck!",

With just **two solid commands**, I’m already getting throttled. For context: I do a **lot of vibe coding** — heavy iterative work, bouncing ideas, refining logic, building features with AI as a core part of my workflow. I’m using AI *constantly* to prototype, refactor, and ship.\n\nBecause of that, I’ve been looking at **Claude Max x20**. But after reading a ton of posts here, I’m getting nervous:\n\n* **Quality degradation** — multiple people saying Claude (especially Opus) feels worse lately\n* **Max x20 horror stories** — people coding hard for \\~4 days, then getting locked out for the next 3\n* For a **$200 subscription**, that kind of unpredictability feels… unacceptable\n\nSo I wanted to ask directly:\n\n* What’s your **current experience** with Claude Max x20?\n* Have the limits been **stealth-reduced** recently?\n* Are you actually able to work consistently week to week without fear of suddenly hitting a wall?\n* For those who switched or compared: would **ChatGPT Pro** make more sense if your biggest fear is hitting limits mid-work?\n\nOne more (very real) factor:  \nI **absolutely hate the GPT UI** — it genuinely makes me feel like I’m 60 years old 😅  \nI *love* Claude’s UI, layout, and overall design. It’s a joy to work in.\n\nThat said, at the end of the day, **weekly usable capacity is the only thing that matters**. As long as I can keep building and not worry about being locked out, I’ll tolerate bad UI if I have to.\n\nWould really appreciate insights from **like-minded Max / Pro users** who are coding heavily and pushing these tools hard.\n\nThanks",

Pro is capable of performing incredibly precise financial analyses, analyzing Excel spreadsheets with hundreds of lines, modifying them, creating new ones, etc. The coding is fantastic too. For me, there was a huge improvement with the upgrade to 5.2. In general, the heavy-duty and Pro model thinking models are just amazing. There's a massive backlash on Reddit right now, as you said, with people in psychological distress who don't understand how the models work. Finally, I tested Opus for the same use cases as Pro (public procurement, budgeting, etc.), and even though it's very good, the context and output limitations severely restrict its use. It also tends to be a bit more prone to hallucinations sometimes (in legal matters, it can sometimes invent an article), and its searches are less precise.",

I spent a couple of years working with a 70K prompt. It was written in a way that generated custom output based on complex input, but needed to be executed in a serial manner. Under 5.x Pro, the models could no longer successfully execute the prompts without at least three ≈20-minute passes for something that Claude could handle in 5 minutes. This was more about the nature of my work, but it was a stark contrast.\nI find 5.2 Pro to be good with less structured work, which it can go and work on for a long period of time, and then bring you results.\nIf you hate the GPT UI, consider why. That's a serious thing.\nThere's nothing like Tasks right now on the ChatGPT side.\nFinally, I think you should consider whether you're using the correct tools. I think you should be looking at Codex vs Claude Code, not ChatGPT vs Claude Chat.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m working on a custom GPT to support social media content creation at a large organization.\n\nThe GPT should help assess whether a topic fits our social strategy, define the angle, choose channels, write channel-specific copy, and suggest goals and visuals. This should all be guided by internal documentation.\n\nI’ve tried multiple approaches already. First I loaded many documents into the GPT, then I simplified to just two core documents. I tested both DOCX and MD files. The results improved a bit, but the GPT still doesn’t reliably consult the documentation and I still see hallucination.\n\nI’m using the paid GPT-5.2 version, and at this point I’m a bit unsure what the best next step is. I’m considering adding a step-by-step decision flow in the system instructions to force more structured reasoning before output.\n\nAny best practices or pointers on what to try next would be very helpful!",

If the model can’t find support in the docs, it should say so instead of guessing. These examples are simplified versions of what I actually use, but will give you the general idea.  \n\nHere are a few practical changes work for me, with examples:\n\nConstrain outputs:\n“For every recommendation, include the internal document name and the section it came from. If you can’t find support in the docs, say ‘Not found in docs’ and do not guess.”\n\nSplit the task into two steps:\n“Step 1: Pull the relevant excerpts from internal docs needed to answer this.\nStep 2: Write the strategy and channel copy using only what you pulled in Step 1.”\n\nMake doc usage visible:\n“Before your recommendations, include a section called ‘Evidence from docs’ with the excerpts or paraphrased bullets and their doc/section labels.”\n\nKeep decision flow light, but anchored to docs\n“Assess topic fit, then angle, then channel selection, then draft copy. For each step, reference the guideline or policy section you used.”\n\nDon’t let it fill in missing info silently:\n“If required info is missing, ask up to three clarifying questions instead of making assumptions. If you proceed with assumptions, list them explicitly.”",

          "text": "The context window number every AI company advertises... It's basically marketing. Here's what actually matters.\n\nI've tested this across ChatGPT PRO, Super Grok, Claude MAX, and Gemini Ultra. The real numbers where quality holds are nowhere near what they claim. Gemini starts dropping off around **20k tokens**. GPT and Claude hold solid until about **40k tokens**. Grok gives you a little extra room, closer to **42-45k tokens** before things start to slip. Past those points, it silently degrades. The chat keeps going, the answers still look reasonable, but it's quietly dropping details and filling gaps with educated guesses. None of them tell you this is happening.\n\nSo here's what actually moves the needle:\n\n**Know your real limits.** Gemini under 20k, the rest under 40k. If you need to process more than that, break it into chunks. Don't just dump a massive file in and hope for the best. If you want to see it happen in real time, try throwing some needle-in-a-haystack questions at a long chat and watch it miss.\n\n**Personalize your instructions instead of just dropping documents.** GPT has custom instructions in your profile section that carry weight into every chat you run, heavier than pasting a doc at the start. Most platforms have something similar. These models aren't going to figure out what's important to you on their own. The more permanently and specifically you tell them, the better everything downstream gets.\n\n**Make it read before it outputs.** This is the big one most people skip. Upload your doc, tell it to do a full read first, no output yet. Then tell it to read again. Then ask it to report back how many words it actually processed. If the number doesn't match your file, it didn't finish. A single pass typically gets you around 60% real coverage. The second read brings it to about 80%. The third read is where you start hitting 95%+. The middle of your document is where every platform skims hardest, and that's where the drift and hallucinations come from. This is referred to as the U-shaped memory, heavy start and end, but drops the middle context.\n\nYou're still going to get an 8-20% error rate no matter what. That's just how these systems work. But the difference between a single pass and a triple pass is the difference between usable output and something that sounds confident but isn't.\n\n**Quick token math:** 1 token is roughly 0.75 words, so 40k tokens is about 30,000 words or around 60 pages of text. That's your real working limit before quality starts slipping, regardless of what the marketing says.",

The point was to understand *why* some developers are calling Codex a “Cursor killer” and whether that idea holds up once you actually run tasks.\n\nI tried two execution scenarios on the same small web project.\n\nOne task generated a complete website end-to-end.\n\nAnother task ran in an isolated Git worktree to test parallel execution on the same codebase.\n\n**What stood out:**\n\n* Codex treats development as a task that runs to completion, not a live editing session\n* Planning, execution, testing, and follow-up changes happen inside one task\n* Parallel work using worktrees stayed isolated and reviewable\n* Interaction shifted from steering edits to reviewing outcomes\n\nThe interesting part wasn’t code quality. It was where time went. Once a task started, it didn’t need constant attention.\n\nCursor is still excellent for interactive coding and fast iteration. Codex feels different. It moves execution outside the editor, which explains the “Cursor killer” label people are using.\n\nI wrote a deeper technical breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/codex-app-the-cursor-killer) with screenshots and execution details if anyone wants the full context.",

All responses are anonymous and are kept fully confidential.\n\n**We will post the results of this research** on this subreddit after the project has been completed and the data has been analysed, to share insights about how people’s perceptions of, and relationships with, AI chatbots differ, and personality factors.\n\nInterested?

      "text": "I have a friend that doesn’t, speak english, and I don’t speak her 2 languages (Russian and Kyrgyzs). So far I have been using ChatGPT pro live voice translation, first gpt 5.1 thinking and now 5.2 thinking. I simply press the side button to open a voice chat, and then verbally tell ChatGPT what I want it to do translation-wise. I have since discovered that I can make GPT’s?? To automatically start the act of translation/interpretation without me having to give it the initial commands every time, but it’s cumbersome to open it up to a voice chat gpt. Is there any better way to do this where I can very quickly on the fly get to where it’s verbally interpreting for me? Just wondering if there’s a better way to do things.\n\nAlso… is there an ideal model of ChatGPT to use? I hit the daily limit when talking to her over the course of say… 45 minutes, several days ago when having a conversation. I would love any input into this because I am starting to feel limited even though I know this is amazing that we can even do this in the first place!",

They will eventually release another model for advanced voice chat, if they don't go bankrupt.  \nChatGPT-Pro subscription gives you unlimited advanced voice chat, but that's probably way over your budget.\n\nFor language interpretation, I create a projects folder and set custom instructions as you would for custom GPTs, so when you click the projects folder and press the voice chat button it starts the interpreter. That way you're not mixing your general chatgpt conversations with sporadic translation threads, all translations will be kept in one folder, and it will draw upon previous chats in the folder as context.\n\nThere isn't a quick way at present to open advanced voice chat for a custom GPT or projects folder. You need to open the app, nagivate to custom GPT or projects folder, then start advanced voice chat mode.",

          "text": "I’d be interested in seeing additional examples but here’s my immediate but considered thoughts. \n\nNo doubt for some, like yourself, the privacy restrictions feel onerous. Especially when you feel your work is legit.\n\nThe problem is the system can’t tell the difference between legit investigation and someone trying to dox or track a private person. “Enhance this image so I can read a plate or tag” looks identical either way. At this scale you can’t make trust calls case by case or user by user. You either allow the capability and accept it will be abused or you block the whole category. It’s a risk calculation.\n\nAnd OpenAI has more reason to be conservative than most. ChatGPT is the most used and most visible chatbot in the world. For a lot of people AI basically means ChatGPT. That makes OpenAI the first place regulators, lawmakers and the media go when something goes whack. One bad headline turns into lawsuits or new regulations fast. So they overcorrect on privacy and anything that could identify someone and/or hurt someone.\n\nI can’t say exactly how Gemini handles these cases. Google is big enough to absorb more legal risk if it wants to. But it is also already dealing with constant government scrutiny and lawsuits, so it probably has the same incentives to lock things down over time. The bigger and more public the platform, the stricter the guardrails tend to be.\n\nIn the end it’s about scale, risk and liability. When you are the biggest target you design for worst case misuse, not best case intent. Sad, but it’s a fact of life.",

I've been using the Research function quite satisfactorily for quite a while now on a free account, but starting yesterday it hasn't been working for me.\n\nOn two separate accounts and on separate occasions, I tried to give ChatGPT research to do, and it does actually carry out the investigation, as I can see in the activity sidebar, but after the research ends it doesn't give me the results. When I prompt it to, it just generates a reply without taking into account the research, just as it would have if I hadn't prompted it to do the research.\n\nThis is quite frustrating, since free accounts only have 5 uses of the research function per month, and burning them without any results really sucks. Has this happened to anyone else, and does anyone know how to fix it?\n\nThanks in advance.",
