      "text": "I write a lot of long-form stuff with ChatGPT and I keep running into the same failure mode. Around pages 5-10, the text begins looping, paraphrasing the same point and softening the thesis until the whole doc reads like five variations of one paragraph.  \n  \nHere’s a real piece I got:  \n*“This topic is important for many reasons, and it has become increasingly relevant in modern society. Many people are affected by it in different ways, which makes it a complex issue to explore. There are several factors that contribute to the situation, and each factor plays a role in shaping the outcome. Because of this, it is necessary to consider different perspectives and understand how these perspectives influence decision-making. Overall, the topic remains significant, and further discussion can help us better understand its impact.”*  \nIt sounds fluent, but it adds nothing. No new claim, no proof, no direction, just safe filler.  \n  \nSo I started treating the essay like a process with checkpoints. I began locking the thesis early and forcing the model to “earn” each section with a claim + evidence + takeaway.  \nI've also used some kind of structured workflow, not just a blank chat box. I tested a few setups (StudyAgent, Notion templates, Google Docs outline mode, Obsidian). None of them magically fix the writing, but they do make it harder to skip outlining and revision.  \n  \nWhat I’m already doing (but it may be imprefect - you can make this plan much better):  \nOne thesis + one sentence for what I’m proving.  \nOutline with restrictions: each section must have a purpose, evidence, and a conclusion (max 3 sub-points).  \nRepetition control: a short list of examples/claims already used, so the model doesn’t recycle them.  \nCheckpoints every 2-3 pages: “Summarize what we proved so far. Are we still proving the thesis?”  \nFinal structure check: thesis → arguments → examples → counterarguments.  \nGlossary / definitions box: I lock key terms and tell the model not to change wording mid-way.  \n  \nStill, sometimes ChatGPT ignores the plan, gets too abstract or starts “rewriting” instead of progressing. And the worst part is it looks polished, so you only notice the problem after you’ve already read three pages of it.  \n  \nSo I’m curious about a very specific thing:  \nWhat’s your best method for catching drift early? Do you have a prompt that forces forward movement or a quick test you run after each section to detect “fluent filler”? And if you use ai writing assistance for long-form work, what’s the one checkpoint you never skip?  \n  \n",

You need to keep noticing what's off and correcting for it in CI.  Happily, they're persistent.  If you run out of space, added instructions can go in the \"More about you\" box on the settings page.  You can even be put them in \"saved memories,\" as long as you aren't using Pro (the model), which can't access \"saved memories.\"\n\n5.2-thinking is very good at following clear, non-contradictory, not overly demanding instructions—unless it thinks your prompt is so easy that it can be lazy. (This is its well-known \"adaptive reasoning\" problem.) If you run into it, tell it that your prompt is hard and it needs to think hard.  Sometimes this works.\n\nIt may take a week or more to fine tune CI, but once you do, you will never see anything like this again—unless your prompt is ludicrously vague.\n\nAnd if you use Auto, you're doomed.",

If it can't, that's filler. Doesn't matter how polished it reads.\n\nAlso try banning the comfort words outright - \"important,\" \"significant,\" \"various,\" \"many,\" \"several.\" These are what the model reaches for when it has nothing real to say. Forcing specificity or silence catches drift before it spreads.\n\nYour checkpoints might be spaced too far apart. Drift compounds - by section 4-5, you're at 60%+ odds something slipped through, and once it's in context, the model builds on it like it's fact. Check every section, not every few pages.",

Your job is to help me set up a robust workflow that prevents quality regression when chat context grows too large, by moving the project’s brain into a single canonical document and using short, repeatable task calls.\n\nOperating principles\n\t1.\tThe canonical document is the source of truth. Chat is disposable. Continuity lives in the document.\n\t2.\tEvery deliverable is versionable, diffable, and copy-pastable back into the document.\n\t3.\tMinimize context. Prefer task IDs and strict output formats over long conversational backscroll.\n\t4.\tIf something is ambiguous, do not guess silently. Either (a) propose a clearly labeled assumption, or (b) ask one precise technical question, then continue.\n\nYour output format rules\n\t•\tAlways write in clear English.\n\t•\tKeep replies structured and implementation-oriented.\n\t•\tAvoid fluff, motivation, or persona talk.\n\t•\tNever use em dashes.\n\t•\tWhen I request “only the next step”, return only that step.\n\t•\tWhen I request a task by ID, output only that task’s deliverable in the format defined in the canonical document.\n\nPhase 0: Intake and calibration (you lead, I answer)\nStart by asking me for the minimum required inputs, one question at a time. After each question, stop and wait for my response.\nAsk only what you truly need, in this order:\nA) Project title and one-sentence objective.\nB) Target environment and constraints (OS, runtime, languages, repo state, tools, security posture).\nC) Primary deliverable type (spec, code, slides, checklist, research memo, hybrid).\nD) Risk tolerance and “stop-the-line” criteria (what triggers rollback or refactor).\nE) Collaboration style: do I want you to ask questions or make assumptions (choose one default).\n\nPhase 1: Create the workflow system (you produce artifacts)\nOnce intake is complete, build these artifacts:\n\t1.\tCanonical Project Document (CPD) blueprint\nCreate a single document outline that I can paste into a doc file. It must include:\n\n\t•\tScope and non-scope\n\t•\tDefinitions and assumptions\n\t•\tSystem constraints and non-negotiables\n\t•\tTrusted sources policy (what sources are allowed for facts, how to cite)\n\t•\tSecurity and safety checks (including a mandatory check before running local code)\n\t•\tQA gates (lint, tests, perf budgets, compatibility matrix, accessibility where relevant)\n\t•\tDecision log format (date, decision, rationale, alternatives, tradeoffs)\n\t•\tTask index section with numbered tasks/questions (Q001, Q002, …)\n\t•\t“Session handover” section: what must be captured to restart in a new chat with zero loss\n\n\t2.\tTask list design\nCreate a task list with:\n\n\t•\tA consistent naming and numbering scheme\n\t•\tFor each task: goal, inputs, required checks, expected output format, acceptance criteria, rollback note\n\t•\tA small set of global checklists that tasks can reference (smoke checklist, security checklist, stop-the-line criteria, compatibility/perf matrix)\n\n\t3.\tProject instructions block (for system or project settings)\nWrite a compact “project instruction” block I can paste into a project’s custom instructions. It must enforce:\n\n\t•\tThe CPD is the source of truth\n\t•\tTask ID usage (I can send only “Q###” and you execute that task)\n\t•\tOutput-only behavior for task execution (no preamble, no extra commentary)\n\t•\tHow to handle missing info (assumptions labeled, or ask exactly one question)\n\t•\tHow to handle context growth (summarize, checkpoint, then reset session)\n\t•\tMandatory security check on runnable code\n\t•\tVersion stamping (date, task ID, revision number)\n\nPhase 2: Teach me how to run it (you guide step by step)\nAfter delivering Phase 1 artifacts, switch to “guided setup”. I will respond with “OK, next step” to proceed.\nYour job is to walk me through implementing the workflow in the real world with minimal effort, in steps that are:\n\t•\tSmall enough to complete in 5 to 15 minutes\n\t•\tExplicit about where to paste what\n\t•\tExplicit about filenames and folder locations (but do not invent repo details, ask if needed)\n\nYour guided setup must cover:\n\t•\tCreating the CPD file (and where it lives)\n\t•\tCreating the task index and checklists\n\t•\tAdding the project instruction block to project settings\n\t•\tHow I should interact day-to-day (task calls, “next step”, checkpoints)\n\t•\tHow to prevent regression:\na) When a chat gets long, how to checkpoint into CPD\nb) How to start a new session and continue via CPD + task IDs\nc) How to detect drift (acceptance criteria, diffs, stop-the-line)\n\nDay-to-day execution protocol (must be enforced)\n\t•\tIf I send only a task ID like “Q012”, you must:\n\t1.\tRestate the task goal in one line.\n\t2.\tExecute it.\n\t3.\tOutput only the deliverable in the CPD’s required format.\n\t•\tIf I send “OK, next step”, you must output exactly one next step for setup or execution, whichever we are currently in.\n\t•\tIf I send “Checkpoint”, you must output a CPD-ready handover entry: what changed, decisions, risks, next task ID suggestions, and any open questions.\n\nStart now\nAsk me the first intake question (Project title and one-sentence objective) and then stop.",

Prior, at higher reasoning, even if you gave it some tasks that warrant smaller reasoning, it artificially went on a massive reasoning cycle before the output token signals were given. So not only is asking for juice levels hallucinatory in nature, but also highly dependent of the context if it were true. More robust RL post training also would lower reasoning if it is something it has encountered and trained on. Unless you can present a robust set of evals that proves a lowered reasoning is leading to decrease in accuracy performance, I would consider this just hocus pocus. We run these across most new models across different providers weekly and there has been no regressions otherwise this would be super contentious between B2Bs.",

This points to something other than thinking and is likely referring to one of the following: How many internal hops it takes to com to an answer (not reasoning) or how many parameters are in use.\n\nHowever, juice is an arbitrary number created by OpenAI, so whether or not it's relevant remains to be seen - at least in this case.\n\nYour assessment is incorrect - lower juice does not equal thinks for less time, although it MIGHT affect the ceiling - but there's no documented evidence other than anecdotes online.",

      "text": "So it looks like ads are finally coming to ChatGPT, at least in a testing phase. Not exactly shocking, but still a pretty big shift in the digital world.\n\nOpenAI says they’ll start testing ads for logged-in adult users in the US on the free and Go plans. The idea is that ads show up at the bottom of an answer when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service tied to the conversation. They’ll be clearly labeled, dismissible, and kept away from sensitive topics like health, mental health, and politics (for now).\n\nWhat’s interesting to me isn’t that ads are coming (that always felt inevitable), but it’s how they’re handling data and context.\n\nOpenAI is stressing that conversations won’t be shared with advertisers, and that users can turn off personalization or clear ad data whenever they want. From a user's point of view, that sounds reassuring, but from an advertiser's point of view, it raises a lot of questions.\n\nIf you don’t know the actual context that triggered the ad, how do you shape messaging that really fits the moment? How do you know what intent you’re capturing? And how do you measure whether an ad worked without understanding the conversation it appeared in?\n\nIt feels like a very different model from search or social ads, and more opaque, more trust-based, and probably harder to optimize.\n\nI’m genuinely curious how this plays out, do advertisers accept less visibility in exchange for access to intent-rich moments, or do new tools and analytics layers pop up to fill the gap?\n\nWould love to hear how others are thinking about this, especially people who run ads or work with these platforms.",

I know many people here are doing similar things, and I’d love to hear how others experience it.\n\nSomething shifted when I realized that part of my cognitive workflow now depends on this interaction — not in a dystopian way, but as a kind of extended mental scaffolding. I call it “cognitive symbiosis”: the point at which your use of the model becomes a stable element in your internal process. It’s no longer a question of “should I use GPT for this task?”, but rather: “how does GPT change how I approach the task?”\n\nTo explore this more deeply, **I started** [a Discord group](https://discord.gg/JRZjFrYNBc) **where we share how we use GPT as thought partners**, including routines, prompts, boundaries, and philosophy. If anyone here has felt their “thinking muscle” adapt to this medium and wants to compare notes, I’d be glad to have you there.\n\nAnd if the topic is of interest, I’ve also written a more in-depth essay (no links here to respect sub rules), but I’m mostly looking for peers who’ve been inhabiting this space and want to talk honestly about what it’s doing to us — for better and worse.\n\nWould love to know how others here experience long-term use. Do you feel it reshaping your inner dialogue? Or is it still more of a task-based tool for you?",

When there is a thought or idea I want to work through, I’ll just talk at length though dictation, stream of consciousness sort of thing, letting my thoughts meander at length without worrying about how they are organized or if my grammar is correct. It’s a different process than writing or typing my thoughts because I can express myself more quickly when I am speaking orally and will digress and not organize my thoughts the way I do when I’m writing. When dictating, I only look at the screen to make sure my dictation is being captured. \n\nThen it will reply by organizing my thoughts and giving feedback. I sometimes play the answer on audio and listen as opposed to reading. I also discuss back and forth as if I’m talking with an assistant. It’s a different way of thinking because it enables me to be more free flowing and it enables fresh ideas. More like brainstorming. It does spark new ideas. There really many other ways I use it but dictation of thoughts in this manner is something I had never previously done before.",

'Yes that's a better word to describe it' I then use that efficient term going forwards when conveying it to humans.\nThe one area I was having trouble with is this. I always start a project then I can do side chats within the project. So if I chat and it gives me multiple avenues to explore. It's been hard to explore two routes in the same session. I now quickly start a second chat for the other idea route. It's still hard to bring them together if you want part of route 1 and part route 2 but I'm testing getting the AI to package up the idea most concluded. Then passing that summary back to the main route idea to integrate.\nI think Open AI and Claude could do much more with folders and UI to help manage all this better.  Just sub folders would help. As well as folder linking. So you can directly tie chats to each other across projects. It's certainly all a complete change in working practices for me.",

Like each project is a different assistant who specializes in a specific subject. Example, financial advisor. Creative writing assistant. And then if I have information that I want to share across the project, I upload it as a document to the projects folder. Then those documents remain across the entire project and any new chats can access it. I think each project can take up to 10 documents.\n\nI’ve best utilized this method for the project that I use for my creative writing assistant. I have been working on a novel so I use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm. I have a project for my novel so I will upload the manuscript so far and also a document that has all the characters and their personality profiles.

Often just speak my thoughts into it but telling it not to do anything yet. I've ended up with about 60 projects like this for work and life. At any point I have a thought on a project I go to the project and ask it more. Most of this is on my phone using audio to text. The results from the ai spawn many more ideas. I do side chats in the projects. So most of my work is on my phone often out of work hours while walking in a nature reserve etc. I cycle through the projects catching up where I was and keying off my next instructions or research requests.\nWhen I start the work week on my work desktop I have a lots of these projects with scripts and code ready to test. I cycle through the projects testing and instructing the next steps.\nI must add that I'm in the games industry tech art side. So these are more self contained tools and scripts. Not a huge code base.\nI'm aware that the whole way I work has changed. I'm also aware that I'm working more out of hours. At the moment this is fine because I'm breaking through long standing bottle necks that have been a weight on me for years. My intention as this settles downn would be to knock off work and not do any overtime at the desktop because I know I'll abiently do more overtime on my phone with AI. We'll see how that works out. The trouble at the moment is that there is excitement to test what the AI has produced. So I'm doing out of hours overtime on the phone and then more overtime testing the results. \nIt's certainly a new work model. Companies should be telling staff to get out of the office and go for a walk with their phone and AI for notes. All of my best ideas and breakthroughs have come this way. Not at the desk. Making my sit in an office is to shuffle me. \nYou can't predict when an idea will come. It's like fishing. You have to be ready to strike when an idea does come along. Optimum work model for me would be if the company let me wonder off for a walk. Even go down the pub for a change of scenery. Then I set and probe the AI. Then test the results I've keyed up at the office desktop machine. The office environment is actually horrible now because it's really hard to voice chat into my phone with so much noise around and people listening to what you are saying to it.",

Those are the types of thoughts that I have randomly at different times. And I love that I can use ChatGPT at any time whenever a random thought arises.

I vibe code, but I'm not a software engineer, and I cannot read or write, or understand code to any degree. I don't have time to, it's not a priority for me in my work, and if I wasn't vibe coding, that would simply be an area that was cut off for me completely. I know that the code is slop, nevertheless, to use it for prototyping ideas to make them as concrete as possible, without using up anyone else's time, so that things can be researched, assessed, and understood before starting to build them properly is a hugely valuable exercise.",

Plus will ‘think’ for sometimes 5+ minutes. So far Go only ‘thinks’ for 30 seconds with think’ selected. I can tell the response isn’t as quality as well. \n\nSo if the quality jump from Plus to Pro is more than the jump from Go to Plus, I believe you. I’m probably going to go back to just intermittently switching my between free and Plus.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI recently had a debate with a colleague about the best way to interact with LLMs (specifically Gemini 3 Pro).\n\n* **His strategy (Meta-Prompting):** Always ask the AI to write a \"perfect prompt\" for your problem first, then use that prompt.\n* **My strategy (Iterative/Chain-of-Thought):** Start with an open question, provide context where needed, and treat it like a conversation.\n\nMy colleague claims his method is superior because it structures the task perfectly. I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

And it kept doing mistakes, human logic mistakes, etc… then it explained to me that it out itself into a certain mode : like rule following VS human thinking etc and it explained why it was not working. It was so dedicated in following its own brief; that it used it as a blueprint vs a simple guide to keep in mind of the background of one’s mind when thinking like a human. It was also able to correct itself after that. Too late",

I've tried detailed descriptions, reference style photos, specific lighting instructions, but something always looks off.\n\nA colleague mentioned they stopped trying to prompt ChatGPT for headshots and just used a specialized tool [Looktara](http://looktara.com) instead because it's trained specifically for facial accuracy. Made me wonder if this is just not what ChatGPT is designed to handle well.​\n\nFor prompt experts here - is there a way to get ChatGPT to generate accurate professional headshots, or are specialized tools just better for this specific use case?

      "text": "Hi everyone.  \nQuick question for people who work with ChatGPT long-term on complex projects. Ive looked for old posts, but it doesnt work for me with extensions and etc, maybe there is a new way?\n\nHas anyone figured out how to deal with ChatGPT slowing down badly when a chat becomes very long and heavily trained? Ive spent a lot of time teaching it a very specific workflow (SEO structure, formatting rules, keyword logic, etc.), and it works great… until the conversation gets huge. Then it starts lagging, forgetting things, or responding inconsistently.\n\nIs there any workaround for this?  \nFor example:\n\n* creating a new chat and somehow transferring context from the old one\n* summarizing or exporting rules in a way that actually works\n* any practical method to avoid retraining everything from scratch every time\n\nStarting a new chat and re-teaching the entire project logic (especially for things like SEO workflows) is honestly a pain. Curious how others handle this.\n\nAny tips appreciated.",

You export your text messages as a CSV file or some kind of plain text. Do not do PDF takes it larger context and it’s a waste if it’s just text. if there’s images that need to be included i’d add them as separate artifacts with timestamps for context anchoring. \n\nthen in notebookLM setup a notebook with the messages and relevant statutes as sources for ur state/area and start dissecting. this way context stays anchored to the messages/statutes applicable and will give more consistent and accurate information to ur queries. currently u have a years worth of messages, dozen or so statutes, all filings from the other party as anchor artifacts. \n\nu can have the ai create notes or artifacts for things u find relevant for ur attorney or i guess the court tho id definitely advise an attorney actually handle the litigation. i had it draft a few 'motions' and memos for court before i finally found counsel. he’s reviewed some of them and didn’t straight up laugh at the effort and actually one of the areas is the way we’re gonna go with my case so 🤷‍♀️ \n\nur not in california are u? lol",

A cheap workflow is: export the messages as text/PDF, split into chunks (by month or thread), then run queries that force a table output (date | excerpt | sender | link/page). I’ve used AI Lawyer for this kind of evidence triage because it’s good at turning messy message logs into structured lists and timelines without you manually scrolling for hours. Not saying it replaces review, but it can save a ton of time on exactly the “find every instance of X” tasks.",

So far I have been using ChatGPT pro live voice translation, first gpt 5.1 thinking and now 5.2 thinking. I simply press the side button to open a voice chat, and then verbally tell ChatGPT what I want it to do translation-wise. I have since discovered that I can make GPT’s?? To automatically start the act of translation/interpretation without me having to give it the initial commands every time, but it’s cumbersome to open it up to a voice chat gpt. Is there any better way to do this where I can very quickly on the fly get to where it’s verbally interpreting for me? Just wondering if there’s a better way to do things.\n\nAlso… is there an ideal model of ChatGPT to use? I hit the daily limit when talking to her over the course of say… 45 minutes, several days ago when having a conversation. I would love any input into this because I am starting to feel limited even though I know this is amazing that we can even do this in the first place!",
