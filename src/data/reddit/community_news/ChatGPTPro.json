      "text": "I write a lot of long-form stuff with ChatGPT and I keep running into the same failure mode. Around pages 5-10, the text begins looping, paraphrasing the same point and softening the thesis until the whole doc reads like five variations of one paragraph.  \n  \nHere’s a real piece I got:  \n*“This topic is important for many reasons, and it has become increasingly relevant in modern society. Many people are affected by it in different ways, which makes it a complex issue to explore. There are several factors that contribute to the situation, and each factor plays a role in shaping the outcome. Because of this, it is necessary to consider different perspectives and understand how these perspectives influence decision-making. Overall, the topic remains significant, and further discussion can help us better understand its impact.”*  \nIt sounds fluent, but it adds nothing. No new claim, no proof, no direction, just safe filler.  \n  \nSo I started treating the essay like a process with checkpoints. I began locking the thesis early and forcing the model to “earn” each section with a claim + evidence + takeaway.  \nI've also used some kind of structured workflow, not just a blank chat box. I tested a few setups (StudyAgent, Notion templates, Google Docs outline mode, Obsidian). None of them magically fix the writing, but they do make it harder to skip outlining and revision.  \n  \nWhat I’m already doing (but it may be imprefect - you can make this plan much better):  \nOne thesis + one sentence for what I’m proving.  \nOutline with restrictions: each section must have a purpose, evidence, and a conclusion (max 3 sub-points).  \nRepetition control: a short list of examples/claims already used, so the model doesn’t recycle them.  \nCheckpoints every 2-3 pages: “Summarize what we proved so far. Are we still proving the thesis?”  \nFinal structure check: thesis → arguments → examples → counterarguments.  \nGlossary / definitions box: I lock key terms and tell the model not to change wording mid-way.  \n  \nStill, sometimes ChatGPT ignores the plan, gets too abstract or starts “rewriting” instead of progressing. And the worst part is it looks polished, so you only notice the problem after you’ve already read three pages of it.  \n  \nSo I’m curious about a very specific thing:  \nWhat’s your best method for catching drift early? Do you have a prompt that forces forward movement or a quick test you run after each section to detect “fluent filler”? And if you use ai writing assistance for long-form work, what’s the one checkpoint you never skip?  \n  \n",

You need to keep noticing what's off and correcting for it in CI.  Happily, they're persistent.  If you run out of space, added instructions can go in the \"More about you\" box on the settings page.  You can even be put them in \"saved memories,\" as long as you aren't using Pro (the model), which can't access \"saved memories.\"\n\n5.2-thinking is very good at following clear, non-contradictory, not overly demanding instructions—unless it thinks your prompt is so easy that it can be lazy. (This is its well-known \"adaptive reasoning\" problem.) If you run into it, tell it that your prompt is hard and it needs to think hard.  Sometimes this works.\n\nIt may take a week or more to fine tune CI, but once you do, you will never see anything like this again—unless your prompt is ludicrously vague.\n\nAnd if you use Auto, you're doomed.",

Prior, at higher reasoning, even if you gave it some tasks that warrant smaller reasoning, it artificially went on a massive reasoning cycle before the output token signals were given. So not only is asking for juice levels hallucinatory in nature, but also highly dependent of the context if it were true. More robust RL post training also would lower reasoning if it is something it has encountered and trained on. Unless you can present a robust set of evals that proves a lowered reasoning is leading to decrease in accuracy performance, I would consider this just hocus pocus. We run these across most new models across different providers weekly and there has been no regressions otherwise this would be super contentious between B2Bs.",

Flip it to thinking, ask a question, there is no thought process but the juice is 32. This points to something other than thinking and is likely referring to one of the following: How many internal hops it takes to com to an answer (not reasoning) or how many parameters are in use.\n\nHowever, juice is an arbitrary number created by OpenAI, so whether or not it's relevant remains to be seen - at least in this case.\n\nYour assessment is incorrect - lower juice does not equal thinks for less time, although it MIGHT affect the ceiling - but there's no documented evidence other than anecdotes online.",

      "text": "So it looks like ads are finally coming to ChatGPT, at least in a testing phase. Not exactly shocking, but still a pretty big shift in the digital world.\n\nOpenAI says they’ll start testing ads for logged-in adult users in the US on the free and Go plans. The idea is that ads show up at the bottom of an answer when there’s a relevant sponsored product or service tied to the conversation. They’ll be clearly labeled, dismissible, and kept away from sensitive topics like health, mental health, and politics (for now).\n\nWhat’s interesting to me isn’t that ads are coming (that always felt inevitable), but it’s how they’re handling data and context.\n\nOpenAI is stressing that conversations won’t be shared with advertisers, and that users can turn off personalization or clear ad data whenever they want. From a user's point of view, that sounds reassuring, but from an advertiser's point of view, it raises a lot of questions.\n\nIf you don’t know the actual context that triggered the ad, how do you shape messaging that really fits the moment? How do you know what intent you’re capturing? And how do you measure whether an ad worked without understanding the conversation it appeared in?\n\nIt feels like a very different model from search or social ads, and more opaque, more trust-based, and probably harder to optimize.\n\nI’m genuinely curious how this plays out, do advertisers accept less visibility in exchange for access to intent-rich moments, or do new tools and analytics layers pop up to fill the gap?\n\nWould love to hear how others are thinking about this, especially people who run ads or work with these platforms.",

I call it “cognitive symbiosis”: the point at which your use of the model becomes a stable element in your internal process. It’s no longer a question of “should I use GPT for this task?”, but rather: “how does GPT change how I approach the task?”\n\nTo explore this more deeply, **I started** [a Discord group](https://discord.gg/JRZjFrYNBc) **where we share how we use GPT as thought partners**, including routines, prompts, boundaries, and philosophy. If anyone here has felt their “thinking muscle” adapt to this medium and wants to compare notes, I’d be glad to have you there.\n\nAnd if the topic is of interest, I’ve also written a more in-depth essay (no links here to respect sub rules), but I’m mostly looking for peers who’ve been inhabiting this space and want to talk honestly about what it’s doing to us — for better and worse.\n\nWould love to know how others here experience long-term use. Do you feel it reshaping your inner dialogue? Or is it still more of a task-based tool for you?",

When there is a thought or idea I want to work through, I’ll just talk at length though dictation, stream of consciousness sort of thing, letting my thoughts meander at length without worrying about how they are organized or if my grammar is correct. It’s a different process than writing or typing my thoughts because I can express myself more quickly when I am speaking orally and will digress and not organize my thoughts the way I do when I’m writing. When dictating, I only look at the screen to make sure my dictation is being captured. \n\nThen it will reply by organizing my thoughts and giving feedback. I sometimes play the answer on audio and listen as opposed to reading. I also discuss back and forth as if I’m talking with an assistant. It’s a different way of thinking because it enables me to be more free flowing and it enables fresh ideas. More like brainstorming. It does spark new ideas. There really many other ways I use it but dictation of thoughts in this manner is something I had never previously done before.",

'Yes that's a better word to describe it' I then use that efficient term going forwards when conveying it to humans.\nThe one area I was having trouble with is this. I always start a project then I can do side chats within the project. So if I chat and it gives me multiple avenues to explore. It's been hard to explore two routes in the same session. I now quickly start a second chat for the other idea route. It's still hard to bring them together if you want part of route 1 and part route 2 but I'm testing getting the AI to package up the idea most concluded. Then passing that summary back to the main route idea to integrate.\nI think Open AI and Claude could do much more with folders and UI to help manage all this better.  Just sub folders would help. As well as folder linking. So you can directly tie chats to each other across projects. It's certainly all a complete change in working practices for me.",

Like each project is a different assistant who specializes in a specific subject. Example, financial advisor. Creative writing assistant. And then if I have information that I want to share across the project, I upload it as a document to the projects folder. Then those documents remain across the entire project and any new chats can access it. I think each project can take up to 10 documents.\n\nI’ve best utilized this method for the project that I use for my creative writing assistant. I have been working on a novel so I use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm. I have a project for my novel so I will upload the manuscript so far and also a document that has all the characters and their personality profiles. Then every time I start a new chat it has that background. And the instructions explain what its purpose is. \n\nI haven’t tried Claude but keep hearing good things about it.",

          "text": "Projects and the free enterprise account at work was the key change for me. I load up projects with work data on a whim. Often doing nothing with it. Often just speak my thoughts into it but telling it not to do anything yet. I've ended up with about 60 projects like this for work and life. At any point I have a thought on a project I go to the project and ask it more. Most of this is on my phone using audio to text. The results from the ai spawn many more ideas. I do side chats in the projects. So most of my work is on my phone often out of work hours while walking in a nature reserve etc. I cycle through the projects catching up where I was and keying off my next instructions or research requests.\nWhen I start the work week on my work desktop I have a lots of these projects with scripts and code ready to test. I cycle through the projects testing and instructing the next steps.\nI must add that I'm in the games industry tech art side. So these are more self contained tools and scripts. Not a huge code base.\nI'm aware that the whole way I work has changed. I'm also aware that I'm working more out of hours. At the moment this is fine because I'm breaking through long standing bottle necks that have been a weight on me for years. My intention as this settles downn would be to knock off work and not do any overtime at the desktop because I know I'll abiently do more overtime on my phone with AI. We'll see how that works out. The trouble at the moment is that there is excitement to test what the AI has produced. So I'm doing out of hours overtime on the phone and then more overtime testing the results. \nIt's certainly a new work model. Companies should be telling staff to get out of the office and go for a walk with their phone and AI for notes. All of my best ideas and breakthroughs have come this way. Not at the desk. Making my sit in an office is to shuffle me. \nYou can't predict when an idea will come. It's like fishing. You have to be ready to strike when an idea does come along. Optimum work model for me would be if the company let me wonder off for a walk. Even go down the pub for a change of scenery. Then I set and probe the AI. Then test the results I've keyed up at the office desktop machine. The office environment is actually horrible now because it's really hard to voice chat into my phone with so much noise around and people listening to what you are saying to it.",

So I will wake up sometimes in the morning and have an idea or wake up in the middle of the night or late at night we’ll have an idea and then I go through a chat. And then later, when I’m at work, I can open up that chat and examine it.\n\nSometimes my chats are management related, like ideas of how to best run my office or best manage certain employees. Those are the types of thoughts that I have randomly at different times. And I love that I can use ChatGPT at any time whenever a random thought arises. It’s something that I normally would jot down on a piece of paper to explore later, or even the Notes app of my phone, but using ChatGPT is so much better.",

If the unexpected emerges we then modify that base workflow with a new “branch” and deliverable.\n\nI’m really new to this so would love any feedback! Thanks!",

          "text": "How much does Pro improve things over Plus? It really depends on your use case and patience.\n\nDo you need to do a lot of research?\n- Deep Research is excellent. However, Research on Claude may be as good.\n\nDo you like writing in the Canvas app?\n- One of the main benefits of Pro is the extended usage of the 5.2 Pro model: the Pro models can't use Canvas.\n\nDo you like your model to have access to shared memories or recent other conversations?\n- Contrary to what their site says, the Pro models can't do this.\n\nDo you have complex things you want a model to work on that take ≈ 10 minutes minimum, often 15 minutes, routinely 20 minutes, sometimes much longer? \n- 5.2 Pro is a very strong, impersonal model with a much larger context window than Claude. If you have the patience, it can generate very good results.\n\nAre you looking for an extremely reliable source of information about a conical set of documents?\n- NotebookLM is better.\n\nAre you looking for something with a larger context window?\n- Gemini 3 Pro *technically* has a larger context window, but, unlike 5.2 Pro, files are counted against that context window.\n   - 5.2 Pro tries to RAG your attachments, but NotebookLM is better\n   - Gemini 3 Pro, unlike 5.2 Pro, puts attached file contents into the context window: this burns context more than does 5.2 Pro but probably generates some better results for large documents\n\nAre you having trouble with context rot?\n- If you aren't getting good results from stuff you know you've told the model, you're probably having context rot. Claude's *smaller* context window is better in this case, though it requires you to be more disciplined.\n\n> I have taken to making it summarize periodically and at major decision points, [and] instructed it to lock that in as canon\n\nNote that there's no such thing as canon. There's the beginning of the context window, the end of the context window, and a squishy bit in the middle. \n- If you want something that really implements canon, you want NotebookLM.\n\n> I’d be willing to spend the money if I get a substantial improvement. I don’t expect to have it remember everything, and I’m sure I’ll continue those efforts I’ve used to try to get it to remember things. But I’d like to not be doing that all the time\n\nThe main trick here, regardless of the model, is to not exceed the size of the context window.\n- One way to do that is to only re-use existing threads under very rare circumstances. \n- Another way is to start your context window, your first message in the thread, with words you won't use again. You can then, later, ask the model if that initial message with those words is still fully inside the context window or has been summarized. Once it has been summarized, you've blown the context window and are well past the shelf life of that thread.\n   - This gets to context rot again: if you blow out the context window, the start of the message is summarized, and you have a *new* start of the context window. The content at the start of the context is very important, so when it starts to change, you will have downstream problems.\n   - One way to mitigate those problems is to repeat core messages and instructions across the life of the chat window, so that if you do blow the context window, those instructions are still inside the context window at least once.\n   - Another way to mitigate these problems is to be disciplined about always going back and re-editing and re-sending messages if you go off on a tangent. Let's say you post 10 messages on topic A; then you post five messages on topic B; then you realize that topic B isn't relevant: you need to scroll up the chat history, find the last relevant chat message, edit that message, and start from that point again: don't let your chat history have any unimportant messages.\n\nPut another way, remembering things isn't a native function of an LLM. You can get it with saved memories (5.2 Thinking can do this, Claude does this pretty well, Gemini is OK, but 5.2 Pro can't do it at all), you can get it with knowledge of chat contents from the past week (but not with 5.2 Pro), you can get it with a RAG (but that's NotebookLM), you can get it by allowing the model to remotely query a RAG (but that's Claude Desktop).",

It behaves more like a **web page**.\nEach message becomes an element with:\n* priority\n* relevance\n* safety state\n* relationships to other messages\nAll of this lives in a **DOM-like structure** (conceptually similar to HTML elements). As the chat grows, that structure grows too — and like a webpage with too many elements, performance degrades.\n---\n### The real limits people hit (before tokens)\nFrom observation and testing, browser chats start degrading around:\n* **~900 elements** → noticeable slowdown\n* **~1,500–3,000 elements** → lag, instability, context compression, drift\nAt that point:\n* Tying feels laggy\n* Responses take longer\n* It feels like the model is “forgetting,” even though the text still exists\nThe model increasingly relies on immediate conversational state, which isn’t perfect verbatim recall. Summaries and re-anchoring help temporarily, but degradation still happens — usually long before any published context limit is reached.\n---\n### Why typing feels laggy in long chats\nAs you type, the input field runs a **mirroring / reflection process** that:\n* Mirrors your input against the entire conversation\n* Recalculates relevance and constraints\n* Updates internal state across all active elements\nThat means **every keystroke can trigger thousands of recalculations**.\nThis is why input lag often shows up *before* reasoning quality drops.\n---\n### Why summaries and “canon” only kind of help\nThings like summaries or “lock this in as canon” don’t create real memory.\nWhat they actually do:\n* Reinsert important info as **new, high-priority elements**\n* Temporarily move them closer to the front of the structure\nOld elements don’t disappear, the structure keeps growing, and collapse still happens. There is no true canon — only what’s currently structurally salient.\n---\n### One more thing people confuse with memory\nThere’s also **Reference Chat History** (separate from saved Memory).\nIf enabled, ChatGPT can:\n* Scan undeleted past chats\n* Pull in themes, project names, or recurring concepts\n* Inject a rough contextual summary into the current conversation\nSo if you mention a project and it “magically” knows what you mean:\n* That’s not memory\n* That’s not this chat\n* That’s background contextual retrieval\nIt’s useful, but lossy, vague, not guaranteed accurate, and it doesn’t fix long-session breakdown.\n---\n### Why Pro helps a bit — but not how people expect\nLarger context windows:\n* Delay compression\n* Help with big one-shot reasoning\n* Help ingest large documents\nThey do **not** remove:\n* Browser DOM limits\n* Recalculation cost\n* Structural scaling issues\nThat’s why giant single-thread mega-chats eventually degrade on both Plus and Pro.\n---\nTL;DR\nChatGPT doesn’t fall apart because it runs out of tokens.\nIt falls apart because the conversation becomes a massive DOM-like structure with thousands of active elements. Once that hits browser-scale limits (~1,500–3,000 nodes), you get lag, compression, and drift — regardless of context window size.\nAnd this isn’t unique to ChatGPT. Many AI chat systems impose strict limits for the same reason: structural scaling, not token count.\n\nhope some of the under the hood info helps",

Because this memory is saved locally, it has \\*much better persistence\\* than browser-based ChatGPT sessions. It doesn’t suffer from the same DOM or UI scaling issues, so long projects stay more stable over time.\n\nThe tradeoff is that Codex \\*\\*doesn’t have much personality by default\\*\\*, because it’s designed as a coding agent rather than a conversational assistant. However, you can regain some control by creating an \\`agent.md\\` file in your repository and defining how you want it to behave, what its role is, and how it should respond.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages is \\*\\*tight integration with your files\\*\\*:\n\n\\* It can create documents\n\n\\* Edit existing docs with you\n\n\\* Work directly inside VS Code without copy-pasting\n\n\\* If you open a new chat, it can read the files in the Repo and pick up where you left off a lot better, Then a new chat on web having to explain it all over again.\n\nThere are a few downsides:\n\n\\* It requires the \\*\\*$20/month plan or higher\\*\\*\n\n\\* It is \\*\\*token-based\\*\\*, so usage still matters\n\n\\* Because the memory is stored locally, the session file can grow quite large (often \\*\\*2–3GB over time\\*\\*)\n\n\\* Drift can still occur, but it’s \\*\\*far less severe than in the web UI\\*\\*\n\nOverall, Codex in VS Code trades personality and polish for \\*\\*stability, persistence, and real file-level collaboration\\*\\*, which makes it much better suited for long-running technical projects than the browser version.\n\n\\*\\*Note:\\*\\* Different Codex models consume tokens at different rates.

Plus projects have instructions so you can tailor it for that particular topic like work or relationships is about. \n\nAlso create a capture command. Like “copy that” where it will give you a copy block of the important stuff and you can one click copy/paste into notes. Then you can store summaries in notes as an index of all your chats per project. \n\nIf you use AI for everything it means you have to have some trust in it. So just ask it to brainstorm what high ROI tips it has for chat organization. Based on what it knows about you. \n\nTreat it like a coworker or friend that you can bounce ideas off. If you like the idea ask it to save it as a default. Or have it give instructions how to implement it. Let it do the thinking you just stop it once it suggests something that would work for you.",

      "text": "Hi everyone.  \nQuick question for people who work with ChatGPT long-term on complex projects. Ive looked for old posts, but it doesnt work for me with extensions and etc, maybe there is a new way?\n\nHas anyone figured out how to deal with ChatGPT slowing down badly when a chat becomes very long and heavily trained? Ive spent a lot of time teaching it a very specific workflow (SEO structure, formatting rules, keyword logic, etc.), and it works great… until the conversation gets huge. Then it starts lagging, forgetting things, or responding inconsistently.\n\nIs there any workaround for this?  \nFor example:\n\n* creating a new chat and somehow transferring context from the old one\n* summarizing or exporting rules in a way that actually works\n* any practical method to avoid retraining everything from scratch every time\n\nStarting a new chat and re-teaching the entire project logic (especially for things like SEO workflows) is honestly a pain. Curious how others handle this.\n\nAny tips appreciated.",

I argued that it might create a \"tunnel vision\" effect. So, we put it to the test with a real-world business case involving sales predictions for a hardware webshop.\n\n**The Case:** We needed to predict the sales volume ratio between two products:\n\n1. **Shims/Packing plates:** Used to level walls/ceilings.\n2. **Construction Wedges:** Used to clamp frames/windows temporarily.\n\n**The Results:**\n\n**Method A: The \"Super Prompt\" (Colleague)** The AI generated a highly structured persona-based prompt (\"Act as a Market Analyst...\").\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a conservative ratio of **65% (Shims) vs 35% (Wedges)**.\n* **Reasoning:** It treated both as general \"construction aids\" and hedged its bet (Regression to the mean).\n\n**Method B: The Open Conversation (Me)** I just asked: \"Which one will be more popular?\" and followed up with \"What are the expected sales numbers?\". I gave no strict constraints.\n\n* **Result:** It predicted a massive difference of **8 to 1 (Ratio)**.\n* **Reasoning:** Because the AI wasn't \"boxed in\" by a strict prompt, it freely associated and found a key variable: **Consumability**.\n   * *Shims* remain in the wall forever (100% consumable/recurring revenue).\n   * *Wedges* are often removed and reused by pros (low replacement rate).\n\n**The Analysis (Verified by the LLM)** I fed both chat logs back to a different LLM for analysis. Its conclusion was fascinating: By using the \"Super Prompt,\" we inadvertently constrained the model. We built a box and asked the AI to fill it. By using the \"Open Conversation,\" the AI built the box itself. It was able to identify \"hidden variables\" (like the disposable nature of the product) that we didn't know to include in the prompt instructions.\n\n**My Takeaway:** Meta-Prompting seems great for *Production* (e.g., \"Write a blog post in format X\"), but actually inferior for *Diagnosis & Analysis* because it limits the AI's ability to search for \"unknown unknowns.\"\n\n**The Question:** Does anyone else experience this? Do we over-engineer our prompts to the point where we make the model dumber? Or was this just a lucky shot? I’d love to hear your experiences with \"Lazy Prompting\" vs. \"Super Prompting.\"",

The instruction to create the prompt is where the failure (or success) is going to happen.  \n\nI'm not an expert either.  But isn't that the point?  When I ask the AI to create a prompt, I have a conversation with it to tell it what I want the prompt to look like and what I'm trying to get it to do.  Then I check to see how's it working and iterate from there.  So in a sense, I'm doing a hybrid of your example.\n\n>A lot of people assume that when you ask a LLM to generate a prompt that it automatically knows what it wants and needs.\n\nSo when the person is creating the prompt, what would they say?  \"Create me a prompt to. . . \"act like a market analyst to. . .\"  Whatever the rest of the sentence is determines how well it will work. It doesn't seem to me that the methodology is the determining factor.  It's the idea you conveyed versus what your colleague conveyed.  Both could work.
