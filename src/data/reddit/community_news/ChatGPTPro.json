Now kratom itself is moderately safe, cheap, and WAY better than the alternative. \n\nUnfortunately, the kratom industry got really good at chemistry and found an alkaloid in kratom that's like 10x stronger than morphine, isolated it, and began selling it as a \"kratom extract.\" It's called 7oh. I thought it was just \"strong kratom.\" I was very wrong. Within a few months I was hooked. \n\nChat gpt helped me first: manage it without judgement and try quitting on my own, multiple times. When that failed, it recommended suboxone. It helped me try to get treatment from a regular doctor, which failed. And when I was pissed off and ready to give up, it steered me to telehealth providers and helped me find one that was quick, affordable, and zero hassle. \n\nIt then helped guide me through the induction (and helped me keep my head on straight and not decide to just give up and go back to taking 7oh). I've now been off kratom and 7oh entirely for almost 2 weeks, and there's no way in hell I would have done it without chat gpt. I'm saving hundreds of dollars a week, I'm feeling more like myself, and I'm finally getting shit done around the house. \n\nI WAS capable of doing it myself, I just didn't believe it. Chat GPT helped me cut through the bullshit I was selling myself, convince me to give it a shot, and helped me through the first few days that were absolute hell (7oh is not a traditional opioid. It affects several other neuroreceptors too, which is what makes withdrawal so awful. It helped me realize the depression, anxiety, flat feelings, etc. were withdrawal from THOSE receptors, not me failing to function on Suboxone). \n\nProud of you dude. Not trying to highjack the thread, just wanted to say I totally get what you mean by having something external say \"hey, hold on. This isn't actually what you want, and this is the errors in your thinking. Try this instead.\" Especially when you're dealing with addiction, and yes—food addiction counts.",

I use it more like an external thinking space or a live assistant that helps me reduce mental load while I’m in action.\n\nA few ways I personally use it:\n\n\t•\tThinking out loud and adjusting in real time instead of trying to think everything through in my head\n\n\t•\tOffloading things I’m afraid of forgetting so my brain can let go\n\n\t•\tUsing it to unblock complex work or social situations by translating vague intuition into clear words\n\n\t•\tOn heavy days, using it throughout the day as a “live” assistant:\n\n“Here’s everything I need to do.”\n\n“I did this.”\n\n“I’m dropping that.”\n\n“Update the list.”\n\nThis isn’t really a productivity “hack” in the classic sense, but it’s had a real impact on how mentally light or heavy my days feel.\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n\t•\tWhat’s the most unexpected or unconventional way you use ChatGPT?\n\n\t•\tA use that genuinely reduced your mental load or changed how you work?\n\n\t•\tSomething you wouldn’t have thought to do before using it?\n\nLooking forward to stealing your best ideas.",

I then asked for a list of cocktail recipes I could make with what I had. once I got it nailed down to what I wanted I printed it out and put in a long thin restaurant menu binder.  It was a big hit at our holiday party.\nEdit: chatGPT also helped me format the menu pages to fit the restaurant style wine list style binder. It also created an accompanying cookbook for the bartender which included tasting notes and adjustments based on different kinds of liquor. For example, some gin recipes do better with a juniper-forward gin.  The cookbook says “If all you’ve got is a juniper forward gin, here’s how you would adjust this recipe.”",

I brain dump everything I accomplished the previous month and ask it to help me summarize and highlight key milestones or misses, what’s next to keep momentum, and how I can learn or adapt next month.\n\nEdit: Since this comment seems to interest folks, I should add the last step in the flow which is to copy the final output into OneNote and label it with the date.  At the end of the year the OneNote becomes substrate for ChatGPT to summarize the year and help with performance reviews or investor updates etc.",

A good suggested mitigation included giving myself a 24-hour gap between recieving feedback and doing any thinking about it, with the thought that this will allow the emotion to subside and to better be able to consider the feedback logically. Obviously feedback can be a gift, so it's counterproductive to take it negatively versus learning from it.",

Basically, I use it as a sounding board and I ask it to explain why I'm upset over an event or thing that happened.  After that I go a step further and ask it for advice on what to do going forward, including self care ideas.  It's incredibly helpful.",

A model of society where the measure of one’s doucheinest is maintained and factored in everyday life.”\n\nHonestly, It did such a good job that I had to ask if this had value beyond the joke.  This made me laugh and provided something that my friends could use if they needed to break out of the “Socialism” “Capitalism” “Communism” “Fascism” cycle.",

But I'm realizing there are certain tasks where ChatGPT isn't the best tool even though it can technically do them.\n\nFor example, I tried using DALL-E through ChatGPT to generate professional headshots for my team's website and the facial likeness was way off. The images looked professional but didn't actually look like the people in the reference photos.\n\nA friend mentioned they use [Looktara](http://looktara.com) specifically for AI headshots because it's trained differently and handles facial accuracy better, while they use ChatGPT Pro for everything else. Got me thinking about what other specialized tools people here are pairing with their ChatGPT Pro subscription.\n\nWhat's your current AI stack look like? Are you using ChatGPT Pro for everything or do you have specific tools you prefer for tasks like:\n\n- Image generation that requires precise likeness\n- Video editing or creation\n- Voice/audio work\n- Data visualization\n- Code deployment\n\nTrying to figure out if I should be paying for multiple AI tools or if I'm just not using ChatGPT Pro effectively enough.

Alias of support@ is shared by multiple addresses such as legal, safety, even their e safety forms. You can pick up on routing of email addresses because of their auto responses or just look at mail headers. Use enough legal words, boom - auto routed to legal@ and so on. \n\n2. Despite the alias, the headers indicate a change between SendGrid and GoogleGroups (to my knowledge, there may be more). \n\n3. The signs of being dead ended by a bot are pretty clear because in 1-3 responses, they will repeat your message, have generic names, etc. Best way to confirm is returning back to the origin of the problem and you will see it repeat the same script. \n\n\n\nI know PRO doesn't state the compliance and regulations but Business does and based on what you said being very much the same I encountered, here are issues I identified.\n\nI have removed internal references and identifying information so if something appears incoherent, point it out please/\n\n|Standard / Framework|Control Intent|\n|:-|:-|\n|ISO/IEC 27001:2022|Establish and maintain incident handling procedures|\n|ISO/IEC 27035|Detection, reporting, assessment, response|\n|SOC 2 (Trust Services)|Timely escalation and response to security incidents|\n|GDPR|Protect against unauthorised access|\n|GDPR|Assess and notify personal data breaches|\n|AU Privacy Act|Protect information from misuse/loss|\n|EU DSA|Identify and mitigate systemic risks|\n|CSA STAR|Defined IR processes & effectiveness|\n\n Important: Inclusion of a standard or article does not imply breach.

      "text": "I’ve been using GPT models daily for over three years — not just for answers or text generation, but as a kind of persistent surface for thinking: drafting, redrafting, reflecting, planning, confronting blind spots. I know many people here are doing similar things, and I’d love to hear how others experience it.\n\nSomething shifted when I realized that part of my cognitive workflow now depends on this interaction — not in a dystopian way, but as a kind of extended mental scaffolding. I call it “cognitive symbiosis”: the point at which your use of the model becomes a stable element in your internal process. It’s no longer a question of “should I use GPT for this task?”, but rather: “how does GPT change how I approach the task?”\n\nTo explore this more deeply, **I started** [a Discord group](https://discord.gg/JRZjFrYNBc) **where we share how we use GPT as thought partners**, including routines, prompts, boundaries, and philosophy. If anyone here has felt their “thinking muscle” adapt to this medium and wants to compare notes, I’d be glad to have you there.\n\nAnd if the topic is of interest, I’ve also written a more in-depth essay (no links here to respect sub rules), but I’m mostly looking for peers who’ve been inhabiting this space and want to talk honestly about what it’s doing to us — for better and worse.\n\nWould love to know how others here experience long-term use. Do you feel it reshaping your inner dialogue? Or is it still more of a task-based tool for you?",

When there is a thought or idea I want to work through, I’ll just talk at length though dictation, stream of consciousness sort of thing, letting my thoughts meander at length without worrying about how they are organized or if my grammar is correct. It’s a different process than writing or typing my thoughts because I can express myself more quickly when I am speaking orally and will digress and not organize my thoughts the way I do when I’m writing. When dictating, I only look at the screen to make sure my dictation is being captured. \n\nThen it will reply by organizing my thoughts and giving feedback. I sometimes play the answer on audio and listen as opposed to reading. I also discuss back and forth as if I’m talking with an assistant. It’s a different way of thinking because it enables me to be more free flowing and it enables fresh ideas. More like brainstorming. It does spark new ideas. There really many other ways I use it but dictation of thoughts in this manner is something I had never previously done before.",

I always start a project then I can do side chats within the project. So if I chat and it gives me multiple avenues to explore. It's been hard to explore two routes in the same session. I now quickly start a second chat for the other idea route. It's still hard to bring them together if you want part of route 1 and part route 2 but I'm testing getting the AI to package up the idea most concluded. Then passing that summary back to the main route idea to integrate.\nI think Open AI and Claude could do much more with folders and UI to help manage all this better.  Just sub folders would help. As well as folder linking. So you can directly tie chats to each other across projects. It's certainly all a complete change in working practices for me.",

Like each project is a different assistant who specializes in a specific subject. Example, financial advisor. Creative writing assistant. And then if I have information that I want to share across the project, I upload it as a document to the projects folder. Then those documents remain across the entire project and any new chats can access it. I think each project can take up to 10 documents.\n\nI’ve best utilized this method for the project that I use for my creative writing assistant. I have been working on a novel so I use ChatGPT to help me brainstorm. I have a project for my novel so I will upload the manuscript so far and also a document that has all the characters and their personality profiles.

Often just speak my thoughts into it but telling it not to do anything yet. I've ended up with about 60 projects like this for work and life. At any point I have a thought on a project I go to the project and ask it more. Most of this is on my phone using audio to text. The results from the ai spawn many more ideas. I do side chats in the projects. So most of my work is on my phone often out of work hours while walking in a nature reserve etc. I cycle through the projects catching up where I was and keying off my next instructions or research requests.\nWhen I start the work week on my work desktop I have a lots of these projects with scripts and code ready to test. I cycle through the projects testing and instructing the next steps.\nI must add that I'm in the games industry tech art side. So these are more self contained tools and scripts. Not a huge code base.\nI'm aware that the whole way I work has changed. I'm also aware that I'm working more out of hours. At the moment this is fine because I'm breaking through long standing bottle necks that have been a weight on me for years. My intention as this settles downn would be to knock off work and not do any overtime at the desktop because I know I'll abiently do more overtime on my phone with AI. We'll see how that works out. The trouble at the moment is that there is excitement to test what the AI has produced. So I'm doing out of hours overtime on the phone and then more overtime testing the results. \nIt's certainly a new work model. Companies should be telling staff to get out of the office and go for a walk with their phone and AI for notes. All of my best ideas and breakthroughs have come this way. Not at the desk. Making my sit in an office is to shuffle me. \nYou can't predict when an idea will come. It's like fishing. You have to be ready to strike when an idea does come along. Optimum work model for me would be if the company let me wonder off for a walk. Even go down the pub for a change of scenery. Then I set and probe the AI. Then test the results I've keyed up at the office desktop machine. The office environment is actually horrible now because it's really hard to voice chat into my phone with so much noise around and people listening to what you are saying to it.",

Those are the types of thoughts that I have randomly at different times. And I love that I can use ChatGPT at any time whenever a random thought arises. It’s something that I normally would jot down on a piece of paper to explore later, or even the Notes app of my phone, but using ChatGPT is so much better.",

On rollout days, different users can be on different backend versions, or even switch versions mid-conversation.\n\nThat causes:\n- Chats cutting off mid-reply\n- Conversations not saving\n- UI elements appearing or disappearing\n- Odd placeholders showing up\n- “Weird but still good” answers\n\nThis lines up with people reporting different glitches on the same day. That pattern almost always points to infrastructure changes, not the model suddenly behaving badly.\n\n**PART 2**: Session stitching broke, not reasoning\nChatGPT responses are assembled from multiple systems:\n- The model generates the answer\n- The session manager tracks the conversation\n- Storage writes the chat history\n- The UI renders the final result\n\nIf one of those steps fails or lags, you can get:\n- Answers that appear but don’t save\n- Conversations vanishing until you reload\n- Partial or duplicated UI elements\n- Fixes after restarting the app\n\nCrucially, the model can finish its response perfectly while the session or UI layer fails.

      "text": "In this post I want to share a popular problem. I used to ask ChatGPT for a finished essay in one shot and the result was usually technically fine, but empty and heartless. It felt like ai writing help without an actual writing process.  \n  \nHere’s the kind of text I kept getting:  \n*“In today’s society, education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals and communities. There are many reasons why education is important, and it can lead to positive outcomes for both people and the economy.”*  \nThere’s no position, no evidence. It’s just safe sentences stacked together.  \n  \nWhat actually improved my output was stopping the one-click “generate the essay” approach and splitting the work into steps: lock the thesis, outline claim → evidence → takeaway. Once I did that, the writing got sharper, more specific and way less cliché.  \n  \nOf course, this won't work for all essays, but in my experience, it usually works 8 out of 10 times. And of course, it requires a lot of attention to detail since each essay format has different requirements.  \nI also noticed that tools built around “structured writing workspaces” can make this easier to stick to. Not because they write better, but because they force the steps. I tried a few options in that category (StudyAgent, Notion templates, Google Docs + outline mode, Obsidian, even Scrivener), and the main difference between them wasn’t the output quality, but how well they keep you inside a workflow instead of letting you jump straight into drafting.  \n  \nHow I formulate my requests:  \nOutline: “Make a 6-8-point outline, thesis + 2 arguments + counterargument.”  \nDraft: “Write an 800-1000-word draft following the outline, highlighting areas where facts/examples are missing.”  \nCritique: “Criticize like an editor. Pay attention to logic, repetition, tone and weaknesses. Give a list of edits.”  \nRevise: “Rewrite with edits applied. Add strong transitions and specifics.”  \nFinal: “Make a final version + a short TL;DR.”  \n  \nHave you ever received a generated text that looked good only at first glance? What are your life hacks for getting really deep and structured pieces? Maybe someone has tested similar services too, what was your experience?",

If the unexpected emerges we then modify that base workflow with a new “branch” and deliverable.\n\nI’m really new to this so would love any feedback! Thanks!",

However, Research on Claude may be as good.\n\nDo you like writing in the Canvas app?\n- One of the main benefits of Pro is the extended usage of the 5.2 Pro model: the Pro models can't use Canvas.\n\nDo you like your model to have access to shared memories or recent other conversations?\n- Contrary to what their site says, the Pro models can't do this.\n\nDo you have complex things you want a model to work on that take ≈ 10 minutes minimum, often 15 minutes, routinely 20 minutes, sometimes much longer? \n- 5.2 Pro is a very strong, impersonal model with a much larger context window than Claude. If you have the patience, it can generate very good results.\n\nAre you looking for an extremely reliable source of information about a conical set of documents?\n- NotebookLM is better.\n\nAre you looking for something with a larger context window?\n- Gemini 3 Pro *technically* has a larger context window, but, unlike 5.2 Pro, files are counted against that context window.\n   - 5.2 Pro tries to RAG your attachments, but NotebookLM is better\n   - Gemini 3 Pro, unlike 5.2 Pro, puts attached file contents into the context window: this burns context more than does 5.2 Pro but probably generates some better results for large documents\n\nAre you having trouble with context rot?\n- If you aren't getting good results from stuff you know you've told the model, you're probably having context rot. Claude's *smaller* context window is better in this case, though it requires you to be more disciplined.\n\n> I have taken to making it summarize periodically and at major decision points, [and] instructed it to lock that in as canon\n\nNote that there's no such thing as canon. There's the beginning of the context window, the end of the context window, and a squishy bit in the middle. \n- If you want something that really implements canon, you want NotebookLM.\n\n> I’d be willing to spend the money if I get a substantial improvement. I don’t expect to have it remember everything, and I’m sure I’ll continue those efforts I’ve used to try to get it to remember things. But I’d like to not be doing that all the time\n\nThe main trick here, regardless of the model, is to not exceed the size of the context window.\n- One way to do that is to only re-use existing threads under very rare circumstances. \n- Another way is to start your context window, your first message in the thread, with words you won't use again. You can then, later, ask the model if that initial message with those words is still fully inside the context window or has been summarized. Once it has been summarized, you've blown the context window and are well past the shelf life of that thread.\n   - This gets to context rot again: if you blow out the context window, the start of the message is summarized, and you have a *new* start of the context window. The content at the start of the context is very important, so when it starts to change, you will have downstream problems.\n   - One way to mitigate those problems is to repeat core messages and instructions across the life of the chat window, so that if you do blow the context window, those instructions are still inside the context window at least once.\n   - Another way to mitigate these problems is to be disciplined about always going back and re-editing and re-sending messages if you go off on a tangent. Let's say you post 10 messages on topic A; then you post five messages on topic B; then you realize that topic B isn't relevant: you need to scroll up the chat history, find the last relevant chat message, edit that message, and start from that point again: don't let your chat history have any unimportant messages.\n\nPut another way, remembering things isn't a native function of an LLM. You can get it with saved memories (5.2 Thinking can do this, Claude does this pretty well, Gemini is OK, but 5.2 Pro can't do it at all), you can get it with knowledge of chat contents from the past week (but not with 5.2 Pro), you can get it with a RAG (but that's NotebookLM), you can get it by allowing the model to remotely query a RAG (but that's Claude Desktop).",

It behaves more like a **web page**.\nEach message becomes an element with:\n* priority\n* relevance\n* safety state\n* relationships to other messages\nAll of this lives in a **DOM-like structure** (conceptually similar to HTML elements). As the chat grows, that structure grows too — and like a webpage with too many elements, performance degrades.\n---\n### The real limits people hit (before tokens)\nFrom observation and testing, browser chats start degrading around:\n* **~900 elements** → noticeable slowdown\n* **~1,500–3,000 elements** → lag, instability, context compression, drift\nAt that point:\n* Tying feels laggy\n* Responses take longer\n* It feels like the model is “forgetting,” even though the text still exists\nThe model increasingly relies on immediate conversational state, which isn’t perfect verbatim recall. Summaries and re-anchoring help temporarily, but degradation still happens — usually long before any published context limit is reached.\n---\n### Why typing feels laggy in long chats\nAs you type, the input field runs a **mirroring / reflection process** that:\n* Mirrors your input against the entire conversation\n* Recalculates relevance and constraints\n* Updates internal state across all active elements\nThat means **every keystroke can trigger thousands of recalculations**.\nThis is why input lag often shows up *before* reasoning quality drops.\n---\n### Why summaries and “canon” only kind of help\nThings like summaries or “lock this in as canon” don’t create real memory.\nWhat they actually do:\n* Reinsert important info as **new, high-priority elements**\n* Temporarily move them closer to the front of the structure\nOld elements don’t disappear, the structure keeps growing, and collapse still happens. There is no true canon — only what’s currently structurally salient.\n---\n### One more thing people confuse with memory\nThere’s also **Reference Chat History** (separate from saved Memory).\nIf enabled, ChatGPT can:\n* Scan undeleted past chats\n* Pull in themes, project names, or recurring concepts\n* Inject a rough contextual summary into the current conversation\nSo if you mention a project and it “magically” knows what you mean:\n* That’s not memory\n* That’s not this chat\n* That’s background contextual retrieval\nIt’s useful, but lossy, vague, not guaranteed accurate, and it doesn’t fix long-session breakdown.\n---\n### Why Pro helps a bit — but not how people expect\nLarger context windows:\n* Delay compression\n* Help with big one-shot reasoning\n* Help ingest large documents\nThey do **not** remove:\n* Browser DOM limits\n* Recalculation cost\n* Structural scaling issues\nThat’s why giant single-thread mega-chats eventually degrade on both Plus and Pro.\n---\nTL;DR\nChatGPT doesn’t fall apart because it runs out of tokens.\nIt falls apart because the conversation becomes a massive DOM-like structure with thousands of active elements. Once that hits browser-scale limits (~1,500–3,000 nodes), you get lag, compression, and drift — regardless of context window size.\nAnd this isn’t unique to ChatGPT. Many AI chat systems impose strict limits for the same reason: structural scaling, not token count.\n\nhope some of the under the hood info helps",

Because this memory is saved locally, it has \\*much better persistence\\* than browser-based ChatGPT sessions. It doesn’t suffer from the same DOM or UI scaling issues, so long projects stay more stable over time.\n\nThe tradeoff is that Codex \\*\\*doesn’t have much personality by default\\*\\*, because it’s designed as a coding agent rather than a conversational assistant. However, you can regain some control by creating an \\`agent.md\\` file in your repository and defining how you want it to behave, what its role is, and how it should respond.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages is \\*\\*tight integration with your files\\*\\*:\n\n\\* It can create documents\n\n\\* Edit existing docs with you\n\n\\* Work directly inside VS Code without copy-pasting\n\n\\* If you open a new chat, it can read the files in the Repo and pick up where you left off a lot better, Then a new chat on web having to explain it all over again.\n\nThere are a few downsides:\n\n\\* It requires the \\*\\*$20/month plan or higher\\*\\*\n\n\\* It is \\*\\*token-based\\*\\*, so usage still matters\n\n\\* Because the memory is stored locally, the session file can grow quite large (often \\*\\*2–3GB over time\\*\\*)\n\n\\* Drift can still occur, but it’s \\*\\*far less severe than in the web UI\\*\\*\n\nOverall, Codex in VS Code trades personality and polish for \\*\\*stability, persistence, and real file-level collaboration\\*\\*, which makes it much better suited for long-running technical projects than the browser version.\n\n\\*\\*Note:\\*\\* Different Codex models consume tokens at different rates. If you’re primarily using Codex for conversation or documentation work, choosing a lower-tier model can significantly reduce token usage and be more cost-effective or just use 5.2 with out the -codex\n\nThis is referring to the \\*\\*ChatGPT Codex extension in VS Code\\*\\*, where you log in with your regular ChatGPT account — \\*\\*not\\*\\* the pay-per-use API",

      "text": "Hi everyone.  \nQuick question for people who work with ChatGPT long-term on complex projects. Ive looked for old posts, but it doesnt work for me with extensions and etc, maybe there is a new way?\n\nHas anyone figured out how to deal with ChatGPT slowing down badly when a chat becomes very long and heavily trained? Ive spent a lot of time teaching it a very specific workflow (SEO structure, formatting rules, keyword logic, etc.), and it works great… until the conversation gets huge. Then it starts lagging, forgetting things, or responding inconsistently.\n\nIs there any workaround for this?  \nFor example:\n\n* creating a new chat and somehow transferring context from the old one\n* summarizing or exporting rules in a way that actually works\n* any practical method to avoid retraining everything from scratch every time\n\nStarting a new chat and re-teaching the entire project logic (especially for things like SEO workflows) is honestly a pain. Curious how others handle this.\n\nAny tips appreciated.",

I love Claude and I think it’s better than any other LLM at basically anything (expect images i guess).\n\nBut for deep research I go to ChatGPT. \n\nThe one thing though is, if you give it a one liner or a shirt paragraph prompt, 80% of the research will be irrelevant and un useful.\n\nYou need a really good prompt with a lot of context and especially context on why you’re doing the is and what you need the  research forms\n\nUsually ill work with Claude using the project features (so it has the full context of the whole project), and when a need for research arises, I’ll ask it to write a prompt for it, and i paste that into ChatGPT. The I get reports that are 80-90% value.\n\nThen I take the report and throw it in the project files in Claude and continue there.",
