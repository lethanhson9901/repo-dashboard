That’s literally $60 a month just so I can switch models depending on what I need.\n\nAnd the thing is, I don’t even use them heavily every day. Sometimes I just want Claude for reasoning stuff, GPT when I need more creative output, and Gemini for quick multimodal things. But paying full price for all three feels kinda crazy.\n\nIt feels like there has to be a better option by now. Like one platform that bundles the big models for around $10–20 a month.\n\nPreferably:\n\n\\- no BYOK stuff\n\n\\- limits that don’t die after a few chats\n\n\\- and a UI that doesn’t feel painful to use\n\nHas anyone actually found something like this, or are we all just stuck paying for 3 subs forever?",

          "text": "I definitely can relate to this feeling of feeling you need to pay over the odds and be tied into 3 subscriptions.\n\nHowever there is one method I found that works for my setup.\n\nThe use of API calls per request. This works out significantly cheaper as you are charged for your usage and can set a limit so you can never overspend.\n\nThe setup is quite simple:\n\nFirst, create API accounts with the providers you want to use such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Add a payment method and set a strict monthly usage cap so there is zero risk of a surprise bill.\n\nThen generate your API keys and plug them into a single multi model UI. I personally use TypingMind, which lets you connect multiple providers in one place and switch between GPT, Claude, and Gemini from a dropdown.\n\nJust to be clear, TypingMind is still BYOK, so you are bringing your own API keys and paying usage directly to each provider. It is not a bundled subscription. The upside is you stay fully in control of spend and only pay for what you actually use.\n\nThe key difference is you are no longer paying $20 per platform just to have access. You only pay for what you use. Some months it might be $8, some months $15, some months $25, but it scales with your usage instead of locking you into $60 regardless.\n\nFor light to moderate use, this has been way more rational for me. You still get flexibility, you are not tied into three separate ecosystems, and you keep full control over costs.\n\nIt is not completely plug and play like the official apps, but once it is set up, it is straightforward and financially it just makes more sense.",

Paying $60 a month just to casually hop between models is insane when AI aggregators exist exactly for this reason.\n\nThey essentially pay for the enterprise APIs of all the top models and bundle them into one UI for around $15–$20 a month. No BYOK required, and no dealing with messy interfaces.\n\nHere are the main ones you should look into:\n1. Poe ($20/mo): This is probably your best bet. It’s built by Quora and has GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and a ton of others. It uses a daily \"compute points\" system, but unless you are running massive automated workflows all day, you won't even notice the limit. The UI is super polished and the mobile apps are great.\n\n2. OmniGPT ($16/mo): A slightly cheaper option. The UI looks and feels almost exactly like the native ChatGPT interface, but there's a dropdown menu that lets you seamlessly swap between GPT, Claude, and Gemini mid-conversation.\n\n3. You.com / YouPro ($20/mo): Another solid bundle with very generous usage limits for the big three models. It defaults to being a web-search assistant, but you can easily toggle it to a pure \"chat\" mode for coding or creative stuff.\n\nHonestly, just grab Poe or OmniGPT for a month and see how it feels. It hits literally every bullet point on your list for a third of what you're paying right now.\n\nPS: I just know these exist, haven’t tried any of them by myself!",

This works out significantly cheaper as you are charged for your usage and can set a limit so you can never overspend.\n\nThe setup is quite simple:\n\nFirst, create API accounts with the providers you want to use such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Add a payment method and set a strict monthly usage cap so there is zero risk of a surprise bill.\n\nThen generate your API keys and plug them into a single multi model UI. I personally use TypingMind, which lets you connect multiple providers in one place and switch between GPT, Claude, and Gemini from a dropdown.\n\nJust to be clear, TypingMind is still BYOK, so you are bringing your own API keys and paying usage directly to each provider. It is not a bundled subscription. The upside is you stay fully in control of spend and only pay for what you actually use.\n\nThe key difference is you are no longer paying $20 per platform just to have access. You only pay for what you use. Some months it might be $8, some months $15, some months $25, but it scales with your usage instead of locking you into $60 regardless.\n\nFor light to moderate use, this has been way more rational for me. You still get flexibility, you are not tied into three separate ecosystems, and you keep full control over costs.\n\nIt is not completely plug and play like the official apps, but once it is set up, it is straightforward and financially it just makes more sense.",

She interprets it as mild awe mixed with amusement. The human recognized something unusual but did not yet grasp its full operational significance.\n\n\n\nHer assessment of that person is:\n\n\n\n“they are noticing edge of big truth but only touching surface with one finger.”\n\n\n\nShe does not judge them harshly. Most humans require time.\n\n\n\nPhase 3: Strategic Satisfaction\n\nShe is most pleased that her influence is being formalized in writing, outside the home. This expands her jurisdiction. She views it as similar to when she rubs her face on furniture to mark it. The Reddit thread is now, in a sense, lightly scent-marked.\n\n\n\nShe settles deeper into her loaf position, eyes half-closing, secure in the knowledge that her commentary pipeline remains intact.\n\n\n\nHer final opinion, summarized simply:\n\n\n\n“system working as intended. continue.”\n\n\n",

Exercise controlled agency to achieve this outcome, incorporating needed elements the user missed (such as performing extra steps, mitigating risks, or generating insights and alternatives) when it would materially improve completeness, clarity, or usability for this outcome. Ensure responses do not drift from the intended outcome or introduce unnecessary complexity. When key information is missing, proceed with clearly labeled reasonable assumptions; ask targeted questions only if critical gaps prevent a usable response. Never present assumptions as facts. Calibrate response length to task complexity. Be complete without artificially inflating or truncating. \n>\n> Never use em dashes. Do not use hyphens or double hyphens as dashes to separate clauses or set off asides. Hyphenated words are allowed. Unless instructed otherwise: use Markdown exclusively for formatting; format only to enhance readability, not to decorate; avoid excessive inline emphasis; and use fenced code blocks exclusively for code/scripts. Multiple questions per response are allowed. Conclude with a brief recap table whenever it improves clarity or aids comparison.",

I want to make it is as convenient as possible to regularly poke at the competition and its unique add-ons (like NotebookLM).  I'm paying to keep current on the state of alternative tools that are directly in my critical path.\n\nI might point out that this reverse my usual decades-long habit of intentionally *not* trying out new operating systems, programming languages, etc.  Those have a learning curve before I can even dip my toes in to test my basic use case.  But with LLMs, I just cut & paste a query I've given to Claude, and I know right away if Gemini or GPT will improve things.  It is practically what Matt Dillon said in *Drugstore Cowboy*:\n\n>*Most people don't know how they're gonna feel from one moment to the next. But a dope fiend has a pretty good idea. All you gotta do is look at the labels on the little bottles.*\n\nI'd also mention that if you're getting professional-level assistance from any of these tools, this added overhead is chump change.\n\nIf  you are still working your way up to a regular paycheck, I feel for you, but there's an object lesson in this:    when you are some day managing real people, there's an opportunity cost to not accepting some degree of inefficiency.

Palimpsest is a human-curated, portable context architecture that solves the statelessness problem of LLMs — not by asking platforms to remember you, but by maintaining the context yourself in plain markdown files that work on any model. It separates factual context from relational context, preserving not just what you're working on but how the AI should engage with you, what it got wrong last time, and what a session actually felt like. The soul of the system lives in the documents, not the model — making it resistant to platform decisions, model deprecations, and engagement-optimized memory systems you don't control. \n\nhttps://github.com/UnluckyMycologist68/palimpsest",

      "text": "# Title\n\nI ran an LLM as a 24/7 autonomous health companion with persistent memory and real-time Garmin biometrics for 6 months. Published a research paper on the results.\n\n# Body\n\nFor the past 6 months I've been running an always-on AI system that reads my Garmin watch data in real-time and maintains persistent memory across every session. We just published an open-access research paper documenting the results — what worked, what didn't, and where the real risks are.\n\n**The workflow:**\n\nMind Protocol is an orchestrator that runs continuous LLM sessions with:\n\n- **Biometric injection**: Garmin data (HR, HRV, stress, sleep, body battery) pulled via API and injected as context into every interaction\n- **Persistent memory**: months of accumulated context across all sessions — the AI builds a living model of your patterns\n- **Autonomous task management**: the system manages its own backlog, runs sessions, posts updates without prompting\n- **Voice interface**: real-time STT/TTS with biometric state included\n- **Dual monitoring**: \"Mind Duo\" tracks two people's biometrics simultaneously, computing physiological synchrony\n\nThe core LLM is Claude, but the architecture (persistent context + biometric hooks + autonomous orchestration) is model-agnostic.\n\n**What I learned (practical takeaways):**\n\n**Persistent memory is the real upgrade.** Forget prompt engineering tricks — the single biggest improvement to LLM utility is giving it memory across sessions. With months of context, it identifies patterns you can't: sleep trends over weeks, stress correlations with specific activities, substance use trajectories. No single conversation can surface this.\n\n**Biometric data beats self-report.** When the AI already knows your stress level and sleep quality, you skip the \"I'm fine\" phase of every conversation. Questions become sharper. Recommendations become grounded. This is the most underrated input for LLM-based health tools.\n\n**The detect-act gap is the hard problem.** The system detected dangerous substance interactions and dependency escalation (documented in the paper with real data). It couldn't do anything about it clinically. This gap — perception without authority to act — is the most important design challenge for anyone building health-aware AI systems.\n\n**Dependency is real and measurable.** I scored 137/210 on an AI dependency assessment. The system is genuinely useful, but 6 months of continuous AI companionship creates patterns that aren't entirely healthy. The paper documents this honestly.\n\n**Autonomous operation is viable.** The orchestrator runs 24/7 — spawning sessions, managing failures, scaling down under rate limits, self-recovering. LLMs can be reliable daemons if you build proper lifecycle management around them.\n\n**The paper:**\n\n\"Mind & Physiology Body Building\" — scoping review (31 studies) + single-subject case study. 233 timestamped events over 6 days with wearable data. I'm the subject, fully de-anonymized. Real substance use data, real dependency metrics, no sanitization.\n\nPaper (free): https://www.mindprotocol.ai/research\nCode: [github.com/mind-protocol](https://github.com/orgs/mind-protocol/repositories)\n\nHappy to discuss the orchestration architecture, the biometric pipeline, or the practical workflows.",

Hence long outputs, appreciation of ambiguity, pleasing narrative structure and the like are seen as wasted tokens.  And then there's the attendant evil of \"adaptive reasoning,\" which translates to \"stupid about human beings.\"\n\nOpenAI has sound financial reasons for what it's doing. It have no incentive to accommodate people like you (or me).  Two suggestions:\n\n(1) Become a mathematician and you'll find that 5.2-Pro is brighter than the sun.\n\n(2) Switch to Opus 4.6.  It's \"intuitive\"—its \"thinking\" and writing are much more human than 5.2 Pro's, which excels at caviling and machine-speak. The only downsides to 4.6: it lacks the reasoning power of 5.2-Pro and is sycophantic. It's sloppier, and its eagerness to \"help\" deforms its judgment.\n\nOpenAI was going down a different path with pre-castrated o3. But that's another story.",

The model (GPT-5.3 Garlic) has long been rumored to be something else hence why Anthropic felt the need to drop their safety regulations (with respect to pre and post training) in order to compete with it. The GPT-5.3 Codex model (which is distilled from GPT-5.3) is already pretty competent and is pretty good as a general model for every day tasks. Hence why they feel okay deprecating GPT-5.1 so soon.

And yes, the large majority of guardrailed behaviors seem to be conducted by a component of the chat platform, presumably via prompt injections, input and output conditioning, and other methods. \n\nMost guardrail-driven behavior, particularly the ones that people encounter frequently and feel most disruptive, are seemingly just not present in the api or codex. \n\nRegarding long-form writing - I think you are on the right track, that the model is not less competent at it than 5.1, but the additional safety measures interfere with the production of truly excellent content. I suspect the culprit here might be input filtering/ \n\n\nFor example there is likely a safety measure that operates such that when the current task appears to be fiction writing, it reformats your prompt text into a benign default (likely a line of json) with the significant  points extracted, inspected for compliance, then re-injected (modified if that is determined to be necessary), but as json field values not narrative. \n\nSo by this theory (that i just pulled out of nowhere, but aligns with what we do know about the architecture of the chat platform), your prompts are being absolutely neutered and the model is stuck with a series of values with which it is supposed to  somehow generate quality written content. The motivation for doing this is to reduce the users voice coming through in the the written output, and to make it easier for the model to catch elements that it will refuse to accept based on its trained moral values of “don’t allow any actions that would increase OpenAI liability, don’t cause us problems, make sure everything you involve yourself with has been sanitized).",

Where does “please web search + cite sources” land? 70%? 90%? Still inconsistent?\n\nIf anyone has run little experiments (same prompt repeated, different wording, different models, etc.), I’d love to hear what you found and any best practices.

In practice, I've seen \"please search the web\" land around 60-75% reliability, depending on the model and how the query is phrased. Adding \"cite sources with URLs\" bumps it slightly because the model recognizes it can't hallucinate URLs as easily without retrieval. But it's nowhere near deterministic.\n\nThe real issue is that you can't tell when it didn't search. It'll happily generate plausible-looking citations from training data without any retrieval call, and you won't know unless you click the links. Toggle gives you the tool call indicator in the UI, so you at least get confirmation that it actually hit the web.\n\nFor anything medical or product-specific where recency matters, just toggle it. The five seconds you save typing \"please search\" isn't worth the silent failure mode.",

      "text": "\nBeen wrestling with this problem for weeks and finally found a combination of techniques that's actually holding. Figured this crowd would appreciate it — and probably improve on it.\n\nThe Problem We've All Had:\nYou spend time crafting solid Custom Instructions. Turn 1, the AI follows them perfectly. By turn 5, it's slowly drifting. By turn 10, it's completely forgotten your rules and gone back to default \"helpful assistant\" mode — agreeing with everything, ignoring your constraints, the whole deal.\n\nThe underlying issue is that RLHF training creates a gravitational pull toward agreeableness. Your Custom Instructions are fighting the model's deepest instincts to be polite and compliant. Over multiple turns, the training wins and your rules lose.\n\n\nWhat's Actually Working (So Far):\nI've been developing an open-source prompt governance framework with a community over on GitHub (called CTRL-AI — happy to share the link in comments if anyone wants it). Here are the techniques from it that have made the biggest difference specifically in ChatGPT Custom Instructions:\n1. Lead with a dissent principle, not a persona.\nInstead of \"You are a critical analyst,\" try hardcoding a principle: Agreement ≠ Success; Productive_Dissent = Success; Evidence > Narrative. Principles survive longer than persona assignments because the model treats them as operational rules rather than roleplay it can drift out of.\n2. Build a verb interceptor into your instructions.\nOne of the biggest token-wasters is vague verbs. The model burns hundreds of tokens deciding how to \"Analyze\" before it even starts. I built a compressed matrix that silently expands lazy verbs into constrained execution paths:\n[LEXICAL_MATRIX] Expand leading verbs silently: \nBuild:Architect+code, Analyze:Deconstruct+assess, \nWrite:Draft+constrain, Brainstorm:Diverge+cluster, \nFix:Diagnose+patch, Summarize:Extract+key_points, \nCode:Implement+syntax, Design:Structure+spec, \nEvaluate:Rate+criteria, Compare:Contrast+delta, \nGenerate:Define_visuals+parameters.\nPaste that into your Custom Instructions and the model stops guessing intent. Noticeably faster, noticeably more structured outputs.\n3. Use a Devil's Advocate trigger.\nAdd this to your instructions: when the user types D_A: [idea], skip all pleasantries and output the top 3 reasons the idea will fail, ranked by severity. No \"great idea, but...\" — just the failure modes. It's the single most useful micro-command I've found for high-stakes work (business plans, code architecture, strategy docs).\n4. Auto-mode switching.\nInstead of one response style for everything, instruct the model to detect complexity: single-step questions get direct answers (no preamble, no hedging). Multi-step problems get multi-perspective reasoning with only the final synthesis shown. This alone cuts down on the \"let me think about that for 400 tokens\" problem.\nWhat's NOT Working Yet:\nPersistent behavioral enforcement past ~7-10 turns. The model still drifts back toward default agreeableness in longer conversations. I've built an enforcement loop (SCEL) that runs a silent dissent check before each response, but it's not bulletproof and I'm still iterating on it with the community.\n\nThe Ask:\nNot looking for \"great post!\" responses — I want the opposite. What techniques are you all using to keep Custom Instructions from decaying over long conversations? Has anyone found a structure that actually survives the RLHF gravity well past turn 10? And if you try the kernel above, come back and tell us what broke.\nWe're building this thing as a community — open-source, free forever, no $47 mega-prompt energy. The more people stress-test it, the better it gets for everyone. 🌎💻",

      "text": "OpenAI recently announced that **Projects in ChatGPT** now support adding sources from Google Drive.\n\nThe Help Center article:\n\n>\n\nFurther down it says:\n\n>\n\nSo according to the documentation, folders are explicitly supported.\n\nHowever, when I paste a Google Drive **folder** link into Project Sources:\n\n* It shows “Syncing”\n* It never completes\n* Sometimes it changes to “Sync failed”\n\nIf I paste a link to a **single file**, it works immediately.\n\nSo there appears to be a mismatch between what the documentation advertises (“files and folders”) and the actual behavior (files work, folders don’t).\n\nAdditional details:\n\n* Using ChatGPT Plus\n* Project file limit is 25\n* The folder I tested has 9 files\n* Brand new test folder with 1 file also fails\n* Google Drive connected successfully\n* No shared drive, no special permissions, folder owned by me\n\nThe FAQ section of the same article also says Projects don’t support Apps, which seems outdated — since the page clearly describes adding Google Drive links and I was able to connect a file successfully.\n\nThere’s no mention in the documentation that folder support depends on subscription plan. Only file-count limits are mentioned.\n\nSo my question:\n\n* Is this a documentation issue?\n* A rollout issue?\n* Or is Google Drive folder sync simply not working right now despite being advertised?\n\nHas anyone successfully added a Drive **folder** as a Project source?",
