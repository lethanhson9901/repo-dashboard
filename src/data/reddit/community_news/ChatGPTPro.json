      "text": "Been playing with 5.3 Codex on xhigh settings here are a few Notes : \n\nIt follows instructions much better than Opus , when you lay ground rules for a repo it always follows them and get things done as you want . \n\nYou are able to program it to do more things , we can play with multiple external tools (Not plugins) to get things Done , testing taking screenshots etc. \n\nIt is more methodical and takes its time to analyse and does not jump to conclusions it worked for 5 min to set an implementation path , which is very similar to how its done in reality , opus suddenly writes code as if it has a bus to catch . \n\n  \nTill now I am enjoying working with Gpt 5.3 and I think its a performance leap , doesn't suddenly act stupid , checks its work looks up documentation before writing code . tests a lot . \n\nI can kick back and sip a beer while my Rust backend it being built !

      "text": "1 year ago I posted \"12 lessons from 100% AI-generated code\" that hit 1M+ views. Some of those points evolved into agents.md, claude.md, plan mode, and context7 MCP. This is the 2026 version, learned from shipping products to production.\n\n**1- The first few thousand lines determine everything**\n\nWhen I start a new project, I obsess over getting the process, guidelines, and guardrails right from the start. Whenever something is being done for the first time, I make sure it's done clean. Those early patterns are what the agent replicates across the next 100,000+ lines. Get it wrong early and the whole project turns to garbage.\n\n**2- Parallel agents, zero chaos**\n\nI set up the process and guardrails so well that I unlock a superpower. Running multiple agents in parallel while everything stays on track. This is only possible because I nail point 1.\n\n**3- AI is a force multiplier in whatever direction you're already going**\n\nIf your codebase is clean, AI makes it cleaner and faster. If it's a mess, AI makes it messier faster. The temporary dopamine hit from shipping with AI agents makes you blind. You think you're going fast, but zoom out and you actually go slower because of constant refactors from technical debt ignored early.\n\n**4- The 1-shot prompt test**\n\nOne of my signals for project health: when I want to do something, I should be able to do it in 1 shot. If I can't, either the code is becoming a mess, I don't understand some part of the system well enough to craft a good prompt, or the problem is too big to tackle all at once and needs breaking down.\n\n**5- Technical vs non-technical AI coding**\n\nThere's a big difference between technical and non-technical people using AI to build production apps. Engineers who built projects before AI know what to watch out for and can detect when things go sideways. Non-technical people can't. Architecture, system design, security, and infra decisions will bite them later.\n\n**6- AI didn't speed up all steps equally**\n\nMost people think AI accelerated every part of programming the same way. It didn't. For example, choosing the right framework, dependencies, or database schema, the foundation everything else is built on, can't be done by giving your agent a one-liner prompt. These decisions deserve more time than adding a feature.\n\n**7- Complex agent setups suck**\n\nFancy agents with multiple roles and a ton of .md files? Doesn't work well in practice. Simplicity always wins.\n\n**8- Agent experience is a priority**\n\nTreat the agent workflow itself as something worth investing in. Monitor how the agent is using your codebase. Optimize the process iteratively over time.\n\n**9- Own your prompts, own your workflow**\n\nI don't like to copy-paste some skill/command or install a plugin and use it as a black box. I always change and modify based on my workflow and things I notice while building.\n\n**10- Process alignment becomes critical in teams**\n\nDoing this as part of a team is harder than doing it yourself. It becomes critical that all members follow the same process and share updates to the process together.\n\n**11- AI code is not optimized by default**\n\nAI-generated code is not optimized for security, performance, or scalability by default. You have to explicitly ask for it and verify it yourself.\n\n**12- Check git diff for critical logic**\n\nWhen you can't afford to make a mistake or have hard-to-test apps with bigger test cycles, review the git diff. For example, the agent might use created\\_at as a fallback for birth\\_date. You won't catch that with just testing if it works or not.\n\n**13- You don't need an LLM call to calculate 1+1**\n\nIt amazes me how people default to LLM calls when you can do it in a simple, free, and deterministic function. But then we're not \"AI-driven\" right?\n\n**EDIT:** since many are asking for examples, I already answered most of the questions in the comments with examples, and I started posting my learnings on the go on my [X account](https://x.com/QaisHweidi), and hopefully will keep posting",

The reason is cost-effectiveness: GPT Pro is actually one of the cheaper options per token when you look at the competition (Gemini ultra has strict daily limits, Grok heavy is more expensive overall), so it makes sense to route all serious research or deep reasoning through it. For everyday questions that need a bit of thought but not full-blown long-chain reasoning, it’s way more convenient to use Copilot o1-based models or genspark‘s AI Chat(gpt model)—they’re noticeably faster. Copilot can easily take 10+ seconds, whereas Genspark’s response speed is consistently quick (partly because of their own output limits).",

Should customers rest satisfied with a $200/mo model that’s so flawed?***\n\nOpenAI deals with the problem by resorting to **gobbledygook on its pricing page**. It previously said that Pro subscribers get “**maximum memory and context**.” On a version now rolling out, it says that Pro subscriptions **\"Keep full context with maximum memory.\"**\n\n[https://chatgpt.com/pricing](https://chatgpt.com/pricing)\n\nThe facts behind these misleading words:\n\n**(1)** In **5.2-Instant,** Pro subscriptions offer a larger context window than Plus (128K vs. 32K) and the same memory. But what Pro subscriber pays $200/month for greater Instant context?\n\n**(2)** In **5.2-thinking**, Pro and Plus subscriptions offer identical 196K context windows and memory.\n\n**(3)** **5.2-Pro** (the model) also offers a 196K context window…***but without memory***.\n\n**Are they hoping that deceptive language will hide Pro’s defect? Do they think that users just don’t care?** ***What is OpenAI selling for $200 if the flagship model can’t use Memory?***\n\n***EDIT: I'd like to see to see the issue discussed until OpenAI recognizes the need to build a Pro with memory.***\n\n***After months, they acknowledged that memory is \"not available with Pro.\" After months, they've begun replacing plain  falsehood with misleading gobbledyook on their pricing page. If the community shows its dissatisfaction with a frontier/\"research-grade\" model that lacks Memory, they may begin fixing the problem—over time, if not right away.***\n\n***If that sounds like a plea to add to or support the thread, that's because it is. OpenAI takes notice of what goes on here and in*** r/OpenAI. **I** **will show my good taste by refusing to mention** r/ChatGPT.\n\n***I've pinned the thread in an effort to keep it alive.***",

Isn’t persistent memory still available to the other models? Don’t you still get more of it with a Pro subscription? Remember how turning on “research” on 4o or 4.5 would make it give you impersonal search-engine-like responses, but then you could turn it off again and 4o would be able to take that data and recontextualize it? Can’t we still switch between models mid-session and have 5.2 Instant or 5.2 Thinking commit relevant material to long-term memory? For engineering projects, 5.2 Pro and Codex have proven to be godsends. If you need personalized RAG, use Projects and feed it the documents you need. Or use Codex in VS Code (if aren’t at least experimenting with that, do you *really* need a Pro account? Probably not.) and have it take notes. Instead of keeping it locked to 5.3 Pro, set it to Auto, or periodically switch to one of the other models and commit things to memory. They aren’t kidding when they call the Pro model (not account tier) Research-grade intelligence. In my experience, it’s far better at dealing with highly complex scenarios that require referencing a large and diverse body of disparate knowledge and then synthesizing understanding of something new and novel and *technically correct*. It’s rigorous. It triple checks. It does what it needs to do to make sure the metaphorical (or literal) bridge doesn’t fall down. When I care about it remembering the specifics of my life, or even the bigger picture of what I’m working on, I can just switch out of Pro. And really, the main reason for me to have a Pro *account* these days is the higher Codex rate limits.",

I spent hours and hours when it first came out comparing to 4o (because I LOVED 4o and was very hesitant of anything replacing it) and it took awhile for me to see it clearly, but 4.5 has much more emotional depth to it, consistency, and better creative writing. It's also more concise (in a good way), authoritative and clear but in a very empathetic manner. It fits that balance between serious and calming. It doesn't constantly hedge like most models do. I found it to be a significantly enhanced version of 4o (and I'm not throwing any shade on 4o, it's an excellent model, by far my second favorite). It is the most emotionally intelligent model of all time imo, by a long shot. Nothing compares to 4.5. There is a reason why it's behind a $200 a month paywall and people like myself still pay for it and that OpenAI hasn't deleted it yet. Sam tries to pretend it doesn’t exist now because of cost, but at the time of release he was so proud of it. He said it felt like the first time he had ever truly gotten good advice from an AI. \n2. It's slower but not that slow. It reflects the quality and how expensive it is. It's slower the longer the conversation gets. The responses tend to reflect what you want in it. If you put in your custom instructions that you like a ton of detail, you will get more detailed responses. But I find that 4.5 tends to be extremely good at \"reading the room.\" It knows when you are looking for a lot of detail vs when a concise response is more appropriate and can easily adapt to what you want. It's not like the 5 series models where it's a constant battle to get it to listen to you and just ignores your custom instructions. 4.5 will adapt to what you want, no issue.\n3. 4.5 is actually NOT unlimited for Pro, but the cap is so high that I very rarely hit it. I've probably hit the cap less than a dozen times over the last year and it was only when I was very deep in work with a lot of back and forth. I haven't hit the cap in months and use it constantly.\n\nAnd the future is unclear, but its not leaving this month with the other 4 series models. Sam claimed that it would stay for Pro users until there's a \"suitable replacement\" but who knows with them anymore. However, it seems to be safe for the time being. Also, just FYI, rerouting still exists for 4.5 and it's the worst part of it right now. Let me know if you have any other questions!",

It's a upgrade to 4o, but it is very computationally expensive, so it writes responses much slower than you're used to. It's main problem is the comparatively tiny context window, its claimed to be 128K context window, but in all reality that's through the API and its actually 32k through the mobile app or browser.\n\nThe real benefit to the Pro level subscriptions is access to the  o3 model and higher grades of \"Thinking\" times available to ChatGPT 5.1/5.2, which is a selectable toggle through the desktop app or browser - not something you can see through the mobile app for unknown reasons.\n\nThe actual \"Pro\" model are *very* good, but its purely for single task execution and productivity — never for actual conversations and it lacks thread awareness and ongoing conversational nuance. Using the Pro model with *\"Extended Thinking\"* is like running Deep Research on a task, you wait 8-30 minutes for a response but the final output is always very impressive.\n\nThe best benefit of the Pro subscription is you get hundreds of Deep Research requests, *AND* most important ChatGPT 5.1/5.2 Thinking Models with the \"Heavy Thinking\" setting.",

It is an end to end development pipeline that can run autonomously. It also has stateful memory, an in app IDE, live internet access, an in app internet browser, a pseudo self improvement loop, and more.\n\nThis is completely open source and free to use.\n\nIf you use this, please credit the original project. I’m open sourcing it to try to get attention and hopefully a job in the software development industry.\n\nTarget audience: Software developers\n\nComparison: It’s like replit if replit has stateful memory, an in app IDE, an in app internet browser, and improved the more you used it. It’s like replit but way better lol\n\nCodex can pilot this autonomously for hours at a time (see readme), and has. The core LLM I used is Gemini because it’s free, but this can be changed to GPT very easily with very minimal alterations to the code (simply change the model used and the api call function). Llama could also be plugged in.",

      "text": "I’ve been trying to build a couple small “agent-y” automations for my own workflow, but the setup keeps turning into a mini engineering project. I’ll get one integration working, then a webhook changes, auth expires, or some API edge case shows up and I’m back to debugging instead of improving the actual workflow. Most automation tools feel like they’re aimed at people who already speak fluent APIs, and I wanted something where I could iterate on the logic first and worry about the deep plumbing later. The thing that helped was prototyping the flow visually in MindStudio so I could see the decision points and data path end to end without writing a bunch of glue code. Still dialing in the data mapping, but it’s the first time it feels like I’m building my own tool with actual behavior, not just stacking templates and hoping they don’t break.",

Once you start wiring up webhooks, auth refresh, and API quirks you’re basically doing backend engineering instead of figuring out how the agent should think or decide. i hit the same wall; prototyped the flow visually first, then added a simple orchestration layer so I could separate logic from plumbing. Thinking in terms of RAG + lightweight state and a clear data path upfront saved me a bunch of random debugging later. ",

          "text": "The pattern I see with most agent projects is that 80% of the debugging time is in data ingestion, not agent logic. The agent itself is usually straightforward, fetch some data, reason about it, take an action. But getting reliable structured data in is where everything breaks.\n\nIf your agent needs to read a webpage, you're dealing with JavaScript rendering, anti-bot protection, inconsistent HTML structures. If it needs to pull from an API, you're handling auth, rate limits, pagination, schema changes. The agent's reasoning is only as good as the data it receives.\n\nMy suggestion: build the data layer as a separate concern. Get your inputs into clean, typed JSON first, then wire up the agent logic on top. Trying to do both at once is why it feels like a mini engineering project every time.",
