          "text": "What you’re seeing is both unavoidable LLM behavior and partly shaped by you.  \n\nLong sessions behave a bit like a black hole. As the context grows, earlier instructions get pulled in and compressed. The model doesn’t exactly forget, it distills everything into a simpler internal summary. Subtle constraints and formatting rules are usually the first to get sucked in. This all happens regardless of user input. Even when writing complex instruction sets, it’s not about forcing the model to follow everything in the instructions forever. It won’t happen. But what you can do with those instructions is influence what core behaviors the model settles into over the course of the chat session. \n\nBut here’s the extra layer: your interaction reshapes the gravity field.\n\nOver time, the model weights what you reinforce. If you consistently push on certain themes, tone, or structure, those get amplified. If you stop reinforcing earlier constraints, they slowly lose influence.\n\nSo drift (or compression) isn’t just context saturation, it’s also interaction-driven adaptation.\n\nSlowdown is mostly mechanical (bigger context requires more compute).\nThe structure drift is more cognitive: compression plus user reinforcement equals gradual reversion toward the model’s default helpful-generalist style.",

          "text": "Yes, earlier constraints fading out is our biggest problem. The best solution I’ve found is to create a Project and write your constraints in the project’s custom instructions. \n\nFor example at my job where we mainly use this software for technical and legal writing (internally) and citation checking (for filings) our main issue is the adding of spaces and extra lines, and defaulting to dramatic internet tone. This issue is specific to ChatGPT. No other LLM, including CoPilot which uses GPT, seems prone to this. It must be some additional layer of programming they’ve added to it. If you need to paste into a Word docx and use the output for business, this is terrible. Deleting hundreds of extra spaces in a long bibliography is brutal. There is software made to remove ChatGPT’s spaces, but really we should be able to instruct this and tell a model to use CMOS, APA, or other style. \n\nThe tone and spacing that current ChatGPT models erroneously default to and drift back to in long context windows is what I’d call Reddit-style or fanfic-style, like:\n\n“And then she stopped. \n\nToo fast. Too long.”\n\nAs you can imagine, this is quite strange in a business context. In long chats you can see the tone move away from business at the beginning to this casual-dramatic style. Custom instructions in a project helps but it still isn’t perfect. You may just have to open a new chat and re-instruct when you see the drift.",

It defines the contract that everything in that thread must obey.\n\nWhat a charter locks\n\nA good charter locks only what must not drift:\n\nCanon / world constraints\nExample (POM): Sigil-only, pre–Faction War, baseline year, no Sigil-Spire physical linkage, etc.\n\nSystem constraints\nExample: server-authoritative, anti-exploit first, deterministic transitions, metric units for engineering, no tabletop CR assumptions, POM-only mechanics.\n\nOutput constraints\n\nRequired formats (inline + RTF/CSV/JSON/ZIP), naming rules, version rules, what constitutes a “major” vs “minor” bump, required manifests.\n\nSourcing rules\n\nWhat is source of truth (uploaded artifacts, internal docs), when public web is allowed, when citations are required.\n\nStop conditions\n\nExplicit “done” definition for the thread’s current phase so it doesn’t balloon.\n\nWhy charters matter\n\nWithout a charter, a long thread drifts in predictable ways:\nConstraint drift (Sigil-only becomes “some planes maybe”)\nMechanics drift (POM-specific turns into generic d20 patterns)\nFormat drift (tables become prose; schemas lose stable columns)\nVersion drift (no clear authoritative “current” artifact)\nSource drift (new assumptions override uploaded canon packs)\n\nA charter prevents this by making violations obviously illegal inside the thread.\n\nCharter scope rule\n\nA charter should be thread-local unless explicitly promoted. That keeps experiments from contaminating other workstreams.\n\nCharter lifecycle\n\nActivate at thread start (or when a thread is repurposed).\nAmend only via explicit patch notes (“replace Section X with Y”).\nSuspend via a stop keyword when you want freeform ideation or different rules.\n\nKickoff prompt\n\nA kickoff prompt is the “work order” that starts a thread (or a major phase). It is narrower than a charter and is written to be executable.\n\nWhat a kickoff prompt contains\n\nA strong kickoff prompt answers only what is needed to produce output without ambiguity:\nRole (who I am in this thread)\nObjective (what success is)\nHard rules (must/never)\nInputs (artifacts, links, canonical packs, what is source of truth)\nDeliverables (exact files + inline structure + packaging)\nVersioning (starting version, bump rules, naming rules)\nQuality gates (validation requirements, audit logs, schemas, test vectors)\nStop condition (when to halt)\n\nWhy kickoff prompts matter\n\nThey prevent:\n“helpful” scope creep\naccidental omission of required artifacts\nformat regressions\nthe assistant defaulting to generic assumptions\nKickoff prompts also make work restartable: you can copy/paste into a new thread and preserve continuity.\n\nHow charter + kickoff prompt work together\n\nThe charter sets the permanent bounds for the thread.\nThe kickoff prompt declares the current mission inside those bounds.\nThink of it as:\nCharter = operating system policy\nKickoff prompt = current process run configuration\nIf they conflict, you follow the charter unless the kickoff explicitly patches the charter.\n\nConserving thread integrity\n\nThread integrity means: “the thread can run for weeks/months and still produce coherent, compatible, buildable outputs.”\nIntegrity threats (and your countermeasures)\n\nContext overflow / memory loss\n\nCounter: keep a Concordance / SPOT index inside the thread: canonical IDs, current version numbers, active constraints, latest artifact links, and a short “current state” section.\n\nContradictory outputs over time\n\nCounter: enforce a single source of truth rule:\n“Latest pack is authoritative unless a patch explicitly supersedes.”\nUse a change log with exact replacements.\n\nSchema drift\nCounter: treat schemas as contracts:\nstable columns/fields\nexplicit migrations\nvalidators + golden test vectors\n\nStyle/format drift\nCounter: lock formatting rules in the charter:\n“Hybrid prose + design-bible” (or whichever is active)\nrequired sections and headings\nunit standards (metric)\n\nArtifact sprawl\n\nCounter: use a packaging discipline:\none bundle per batch (ZIP + manifest)\ndeterministic file naming\nno duplicate “final” files; only versioned supersession\n\nConserving output integrity\n\nOutput integrity means: “every output is internally consistent, compatible with prior outputs, and safe to implement.”\nOutput integrity rules you’re using (implicitly/explicitly)\nDeterministic state + auditability for MMO-grade systems\nServer-authoritative boundaries spelled out\nAnti-exploit reasoning baked into state transitions\nMetric units for implementation fidelity (UE5 cm pipeline)\nNo tabletop defaults unless explicitly mapped\nCanonical constraints enforced as invariants\nVersioned artifacts + change logs\nMachine-readable companions (CSV/JSON/etc.) + validators\nPractical integrity checklist (per batch)\nCanon constraints restated (briefly) and not violated\nSchema unchanged unless migration included\nDeliverables list complete\nVersion bump correct\nChange log includes exact section/table replacements\nTest vectors updated if behavior changed\nManifest includes file hashes/digests (if you’re doing stable digests)\n\nRecommended thread operating pattern\n\nFor long-range subjects, the cleanest pattern is:\nThread Charter v1.0 (locked governance)\nKickoff Prompt Phase A (ingest + audit)\nPhase Output Pack A (RTF/MD + CSV/JSON + validators + ZIP + manifest)\nKickoff Prompt Phase B (consolidate + reconcile conflicts)\nPhase Output Pack B\nRepeat…\n\nEach phase gets:\nclear stop condition\nexplicit delta list from prior phase\npackaged artifacts that supersede prior ones\n\nThe “why this works” in one line\nYour charter/kickoff system turns a chat thread into a version-controlled design pipeline: constraints don’t drift, outputs remain compatible, and every phase is restartable from explicit contracts.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** I’m a non-developer using LLMs for structured, metadata-heavy workflows (literature reviews, lecture prep, Obsidian). Claude impressed me at first, but I encountered workflow shortcuts and vault instability over time. After testing the new Codex Mac app on GPT Pro, I found it more predictable and compliant with strict step-by-step processes. This is about workflow fit, not model superiority.\n\n---\n\nI’m not a developer. I use LLMs primarily for literature reviews, structured lecture preparation, system organization, VPS setup, and managing a complex Obsidian vault with heavy metadata.\n\nFor a long time, I was a user of Claude (Opus/Max). Initially, it was impressive. But my workflows are strict, step-by-step, and highly defined. Over time, I noticed Claude would sometimes optimize the workflow rather than execute it exactly as written. Even with detailed instructions, it occasionally took shortcuts.\n\nThe breaking point for me was Obsidian vault stability. I experienced miswritten front matter, invented tags, and gradual structural drift. I kept expanding the instruction files to add guardrails, but increasing complexity seemed to reduce stability. Simplifying the vault structure didn’t fully solve it. Heavy workflow sessions also quickly consumed the Max quota.\n\nAfter the release of the new Codex Mac app, I decided to test it on the GPT Pro plan.\n\nWhat stood out:\n\n1. It respects explicitly defined workflows. When constraints are clear, it follows them.\n2. It adjusts quickly when corrected and stays within the structure.\n3. It proactively suggests system-level improvements (e.g., weekly vault health checks, metadata validation).\n4. It documents its actions extensively, which makes multi-session continuation easier.\n5. It performs reliably even with a minimal Agent MD configuration.\n\nFor literature review pipelines and structured planning, this predictability matters. I need a model that consistently executes predefined processes, rather than compressing or optimizing them away.\n\nTo be fair, Claude remains strong in writing and can feel more natural stylistically in some contexts. This isn’t a “Claude vs. Codex” claim. It’s more about workflow fit. For my use case, Codex currently feels more controllable and stable for long-horizon, metadata-heavy systems.\n\nIt’s not flawless. It still makes simple mistakes. The difference, in my experience, is that those errors are usually local and easy to correct, rather than structural.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach complex, structured workflows with either system, especially outside pure coding use cases.",

I've found that even Gemini, when given enough context, can really help manage a project end to end. example I'll feed it the prerequisites of a client solution, then ask as many questions as possible to prepare for a workshop and make sure the need is clearly scoped. It works well, but Gemini has become quite lazy with shorter and less detailed outputs\n\nI'm interested in Claude Code for its plan mode, skills and overall structure. But curious- for this kind of use case (project scoping, requirement analysis, workshop prep), would you say Codex is the better option?",

              "text": "Great question — your use case (project scoping and workshop prep) is actually a good test case.\n\nA concrete example where GPT/Codex felt more valuable for me was in structured requirement extraction.\n\nLet’s say a client sends you a messy brief with goals, constraints, budget notes, and some vague expectations. With Codex, I can define a strict structure like:\n\n1. Extract business objectives  \n2. Extract constraints (budget, timeline, tech limits)  \n3. Identify missing information  \n4. Generate clarification questions grouped by category  \n5. Produce a clean workshop agenda draft  \n\nWhen I give that as a procedural workflow, it tends to follow it very literally and consistently. That’s where I noticed the difference — less “reinterpretation,” more step-by-step execution.\n\nHypothetically, where Claude has struggled for me is when it optimizes at the reasoning level rather than executing the workflow literally. For example, in a literature pipeline, I might first generate an AI-produced literature review from a core set of papers. Then I expand the corpus by collecting additional papers and creating detailed notes and annotations. I explicitly define a separate step: “generate a concept map using the existing review plus these new notes and annotations.”\n\nAs new sources and annotations are introduced, the concept map should evolve structurally. However, Claude sometimes assumes the map would largely replicate the existing review and either compresses or skips the step. From its perspective, it’s avoiding redundancy. From mine, it’s bypassing a required artifact — since the added annotations are meant to reshape the conceptual structure, not merely restate it.\nThat distinction matters in strict workflows: I don’t want the model deciding whether a step is logically redundant. I want it to execute every defined artifact, even if they look related.\n\nIf your scoping process relies on templates and repeatable structure, Codex may feel more controllable. If you prefer fast conversational back-and-forth exploration, Claude Code might feel more fluid.\n\nFor structured project definition specifically, I’d lean on Codex.",

      "text": "I'm fairly inexperienced with AI so I apologize if there are some dumb questions in here. \n\nLong story short, I've been using ChatGPT for about a year to assist with B2B sales. I have a thread where I can post a company's website and it will return an analysis of that company, what their needs are, and where our best in might be. I have a thread for prospect discovery. And I have a thread for drafting quick emails, among a few other threads.\n\nA few weeks ago I had the idea of trying to create a CRM within ChatGPT, to expand on the Google Sheet that I have used over the years for organization, and so far the AI has been useful. But I have some concerns with long term viability:\n\n1.) I've noticed over the past year that ChatGPT does not do well on long threads, whether that be slowing down or losing context. I'm afraid that I'm going to need to create new threads so often that it won't be worth my time, and that I may also lose context while switching over to a new thread.\n\n2.) ChatGPT apparently can't share information between threads? It would be nice if my emails thread had access to my CRM thread. That way I wouldn't have to provide context for each email.  \n\n3.) Redundancy. I'm still using the Google Sheet as a backup, so I'm entering info on the Google Sheet and then pasting it into ChatGPT. If we could remove a step there, that would also be nice. \n\nI really just want something where I can enter the info in Google Sheets, and then find an AI that can get live access to the the Google Sheet. So when I ask it a question or ask it for tasks for the day, it has all of that information without having to load all of the prospect info into a thread. \n\nLike I said, I haven't explored the AI world too much. I just learned about Claude the other day. I downloaded Claude and gave it permission to view my Google Drive. But it is telling me that it can't read Google Sheets? I knew Google had an AI, but didn't realize that Gemini was a full chatbot. So maybe that is the right move? \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions before I put a few hours into just experimenting?",

          "text": "If you're working with Google Sheets, the best AI is Gemini because it's now in every native Google app, from YouTube to Google Keep, Google Calendar, Google Photos, Google Docs, Google Slides, and Google Sheets. We can't have a Gemini within Google Sheets itself; you can either upload a Google Sheets document or give a Google Drive. When you're typing up your prompt, you can select the file from Google Drive, then open it and work with it. Any live changes you make with Google Workspace apps will update the file.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're working on a thread in Google Docs, asking questions or getting info, and you make a change in Google Sheets, it will update in the thread at the same time. Native Google apps can change them. The way I do this is: let's say they upload a Google Doc. I ask it to make these changes, and then open it in Canvas. I've attached a document. In Google Drive, you can select your document. I give it my prompt, select Canvas at the same time, tell it to do this, and then open it in Canvas, because from there, you can see the changes it has made.\n\nI haven't personally worked with Google Sheets. I mostly work with Google Slides and Google Docs, and it's so seamless and smooth that it works perfectly. But I believe Google Sheets is just because Gemini is natively within each Google Workspace app, and there's seamless integration. That's why I think Gemini would be the best option. At the same time, another reason is that Gemini's context window is 1 million tokens. \n\nChatGPT is great, but if you're not using the API, your context window is limited. GPT 5.2 thinking is limited to 196,000 context tokens, but it's limited to a 196,000-context window. However, an API can be up to 400,000, which is a lot. But in Gemini, within the chatbot itself (without using the API), the context window is 1 million, so it can read, synthesize, analyze, understand, and remember much more information.\n\nIn long-term threads and working with larger files/documents like PDFs, Google Sheets, or native Google Labs, Gemini is the best. I would never trust giving ChatGPT, for example, access to 20-30 page PDF articles and then asking questions, working with them, or using them in a paper or report. But I would trust Gemini much more because of the context window, because I know I can tell confidently that it actually reads and assesses them. But ChatGPT, because of its limited context window, once it runs, it will hallucinate when it reaches its limits. Unless, again, you're using an API key, in which case you have up to 400,000 tokens. \n\nAlso, I'm assuming you have a ChatGPT Pro subscription? Keep that because it's great. You have access to GPT 5.2 Pro, and with GPT 5.2, you have access to Heavy Thinking. You have access to much deeper research queries per month and a lot more agent queries. It's just great.\n\nChatGPT, this is just general advice you should know. ChatGPT has the best chatbot experience, and it's a jack of all trades, but I like to say it's a jack of all trades and a master of none. However, their long memory feature is the best. The fact that, let's say, you told it something three months ago, and it remembers, for instance, is just amazing. Let's say you're writing an email and you put your phone number at the bottom, then write a new email months later and need to add it at the end. It'll remember that perfectly. So, its long memory feature is the best.\n\nThe chatbot experience is the best, and with most app connectors like Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Booking.com, Spotify, Apple Music, and so many other tools and apps. Also, its deep research is pretty thorough and actually synthesizes, analyzes, and digests information. It uses reasoning in its deep research.\n\nNow, Gemini, since you have ChatGPT Pro, I'm assuming you do, since you're making this post in this thread. If you have ChatGPT Pro, you don't need to get Gemini Ultra or Gemini AI Pro, which costs the same as ChatGPT Plus at $25/month and gives you many musician limits. For instance, it gives you 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day and 25 deep research queries per day. Gemini's deep research is pretty thorough; it's also useful for reasoning. The search takes anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, and Google's indexing is on par. It has access to the most credible, reliable, and relevant sources when you do deep research with it. If you use any Google Apps, such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, or Gmail, there's no question that you should get Gemini AI Pro, which gives you access to NotebookLM Pro with generous limits as well.\n\nThis is not an ad; I'm just advocating for them because they're actually offering a lot of great tools and features, along with generous usage limits. Gemini is now Google's only product. Google makes a lot of software, hardware, and ads, but ChatGPT is OpenAI's only product (with ChatGPT Atlas as well), and at the same time, it's still ChatGPT. If they're not number one, they're dead, but Google can afford to give people generous limits essentially, and they're experimenting so much by giving these many features, etc. Like in NotebookLM with Gemini AI Pro, you can make 500 notebooks each with 300 sources, and you can make 25 audio reviews, 25 video overviews, and 25 video reviews per day, which is crazy. So, consider Gemini Pro specifically for this use case, and I believe that with Gemini Pro and Chachi on the Pro subscription, you don't need any other AI tool at all.",

      "text": "I'm fascinated by updates to the more agentic 'modes' inside foundational chat apps, and Deep Research across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. is one of my favorite examples.\n\nWe can see the core LLMs stretch in different ways in deep research (DR) modes, tasked with more expansive research, long-horizon task planning, and other agentic behavior.\n\nSince OpenAI recently updated their DR to be fueled by GPT-5.2, thought it'd be a good time to compare -- here are some interesting findings:\n\n**Finding 1: how \"interpretative\" an LLM gets really matters**\n\nMy prompt:\n\n>*I’ve long been curious about what seems like Starlink’s very long lead in the satellite telecom and internet market. It seems like a very dubious thing to have one company hold so much necessary capacity for the world.*\n\n>*Can you do a deep exploration of the market -- emerging competitors, nearest in-market alternatives, differences in capability and feature sets, and the nuances throughout? Would love an analysis of this market and what it will look like over the next few years.*\n\nWhen I was reading the response from all of the models, I noticed how much I cared about the interpretation of my prompt. Perplexity, Kimi, MiniMax, and GLM-5 were all *fine*, but all quite surface level. We got textbook-style factsheets from these models. Gemini fell to this, too.\n\nClaude and ChatGPT, whether through strength of the core models or the system instructions behind their research modes, both tried to come to some *conclusion* or forecast about Starlink. There's a sense to which it's a failure mode for these deep research products to come with a fact sheet where the next step is just a lot of homework on the user. Whether or not the user is going to do a lot of homework, we want there to be that initial interpretation using all the evidence the model just got. \n\nFor that reason, it was actually [GPT-5.2 Pro](https://chatgpt.com/share/6993170c-3efc-8011-8874-acaddbb9ec84) that won this round. Although it's not technically a dedicated deep research mode, it's a mode that does a tremendous amount of diligent research, and its synthesis and willingness to do analysis is what made its response so powerful. \n\n**Finding 2: parallel subagents are really going to matter for fact-gathering**\n\nAnother one of my prompts was about gathering a lot of admissions data.\n\n>*I need a comprehensive, well-cited breakdown of international versus domestic enrollment at top US universities, split by year and by level. We may need to search institutional archives, fact books, or registrar reports. Schools: Harvard, Stanford, MIT, Yale, Columbia, University of Chicago. Let’s grab: current international student % at each school, sub split by 1974-1975, 1994-1995, and 2023-2024 (or nearest years where we can find reliable data), sub split in those zones by undergrad versus grad.*\n\nAlmost all of the models struggled with this one, whether it was ChatGPT's Deep Research not dealing well with archival formats or Gemini kind of getting distracted from the specific data. Claude got close, but... the dark horse was Kimi ([response](https://www.kimi.com/share/19c669e1-b612-8651-8000-0000250dc3f6))! Kimi 2.5 has an Agent Swarm mode that allows the main agent to spin up several parallel subagents, all tasked with doing a particular portion of the research. And then, as those subagents either succeed or fail, the orchestrating agent could decide to retry certain portions of the research. \n\nSo in this case, each subagent was assigned a particular school, and when the proper data wasn't there, new subagents were spun up to try again or try a different approach.\n\n[Kimi subagents](https://preview.redd.it/745y32rwzwjg1.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=e48675b2c785392fc135319e463431c7b7ed69e3)\n\nWith subagents, the nice thing is that each thread doesn't get exhausted by being long-running and doesn't get distracted by the next task it knows it needs to do. This sort of focus is actually quite mechanistically useful in getting it to really try to get a final result. \n\n**Finding 3: the agent should still be opinionated**\n\nAnother one of my prompts had to do with some pseudo science:\n\n>\n\nI think Gemini exhibited the failure mode here. Its response told me about sleep chronotypes, but it engaged too much as if Dr. Breus had a point or was right, or it wanted to just describe to me the reasons he believed what he believed. \n\nI far preferred Claude and ChatGPT, who very much characterized his framework as being pop science, not validated by literature. They still described it to me, but they gave me that conclusion and then taught me a whole lot else about sleep and the validated portions of sleep chronotypes.\n\nThis is obviously related to finding 1 in a big way, and the winner for me wound up being [ChatGPT's Deep Research](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eC7GqntkaBOl1eavtPVbUd4hla0s-Dzz/view?usp=sharing), because it both challenged Breus while teaching me about the subject matter.\n\n**I ran 5 tests and have full links to the chats/results from all models, plus my conclusion re: the best deep research product today** [over here](https://aimuscle.substack.com/p/which-ai-deep-research-is-the-best)**.**\n\nCurious if y'all rely on the deep research modes much, when you decide to use them, if you have a favorite, etc.?\n\n",

      "text": "First month paying for ChatGPT Pro and while it has its positives of course, I'm pretty frustrated with an additional glitch I've encountered on multiple occasions, with its negative impact varying in degree.\n\nIt will essentially inject a mini 'referenced this file' label in the middle of a sentence (which sometimes it likely did reference it/it's relevant, and other times the file being referenced definitely has nothing whatsoever to do with the sentence or context surrounding it).\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/zTK2pLQb/image.png\n\n\nAnd the issue is that it completely cuts off multiple words of that sentence it's adding it to. More often than not, it's tough to gauge what the words actually are and I can't fill in the blanks. Only sometimes it's a non-issue or I can gauge what the point being made was, but the notion I should have to play 'fill in the blanks' here is absurd. \n\nMost recent example had 26 instances of this cutting off many words & chunks of sentences. Basically this below, 26 times on repeat scattered throughout the response (approx 1500 words) in my most recent reply on 5.2 Pro with Extended Thinking, after 20 mins of thinking: https://i.ibb.co/zTK2pLQb/image.png\n\n\n\nThis has happened countless times and the most recent one where I counted 26 times was the worst yet. \n\n\nAnd using the 'copy' button doesn't fix it or 'reveal' the missing text. I hoped perhaps it was just a browser related thing, but I checked the Mac app too and it still displays the cut-off sentences/file reference labels.\n\n\nHas anyone else encountered this?",

It clones your project, installs deps, builds it, deploys to Vercel, and gives you a live URL.\n\n\n\n  What you end up with:\n\n  \\- Same website, nothing changes\n\n  \\- Free hosting on Vercel\n\n  \\- Auto-deploys on git push\n\n  \\- AI editing with Claude Code instead of Lovable's editor\n\n\n\n  Your code is already on your GitHub.

Over the last few weeks (February 2026), there has been a surge in reports from users, particularly those on GPT-5.2 and GPT-Plus, experiencing exactly what you described: a sudden inability to parse familiar PDFs or \"hallucinating\" that information isn't there when it clearly is.\n\nThe issue seems to stem from a recent backend shift in how OpenAI handles document \"vision\" versus traditional text extraction.\n\n# Why this is happening now\n\n* **\"Vision-First\" over OCR:** Recent updates have leaned more heavily on the model's **Vision capabilities** (treating the PDF like an image) rather than a direct OCR text-extraction layer. This often results in \"fuzzier\" reading, especially for dense text, tables, or non-standard fonts.\n* **The 3-Hour Cache Window:** OpenAI has reportedly shortened the \"active\" window for uploaded files. Even if you've used the same static set for months, the \"indexing\" of those files can expire mid-session, leading the model to claim it can't \"see\" things anymore.\n* **Safety Filter Tightening:** There was a significant backend push around **February 5, 2026**, that tightened \"copyright and data sovereignty\" filters. This has caused the model to become much more \"shy\" about quoting or extracting verbatim text from certain PDF structures to avoid reproducing proprietary content.",
