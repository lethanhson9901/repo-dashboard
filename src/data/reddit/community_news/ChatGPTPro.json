          "text": "What you’re seeing is both unavoidable LLM behavior and partly shaped by you.  \n\nLong sessions behave a bit like a black hole. As the context grows, earlier instructions get pulled in and compressed. The model doesn’t exactly forget, it distills everything into a simpler internal summary. Subtle constraints and formatting rules are usually the first to get sucked in. This all happens regardless of user input. Even when writing complex instruction sets, it’s not about forcing the model to follow everything in the instructions forever. It won’t happen. But what you can do with those instructions is influence what core behaviors the model settles into over the course of the chat session. \n\nBut here’s the extra layer: your interaction reshapes the gravity field.\n\nOver time, the model weights what you reinforce. If you consistently push on certain themes, tone, or structure, those get amplified. If you stop reinforcing earlier constraints, they slowly lose influence.\n\nSo drift (or compression) isn’t just context saturation, it’s also interaction-driven adaptation.\n\nSlowdown is mostly mechanical (bigger context requires more compute).\nThe structure drift is more cognitive: compression plus user reinforcement equals gradual reversion toward the model’s default helpful-generalist style.",

          "text": "Yes, earlier constraints fading out is our biggest problem. The best solution I’ve found is to create a Project and write your constraints in the project’s custom instructions. \n\nFor example at my job where we mainly use this software for technical and legal writing (internally) and citation checking (for filings) our main issue is the adding of spaces and extra lines, and defaulting to dramatic internet tone. This issue is specific to ChatGPT. No other LLM, including CoPilot which uses GPT, seems prone to this. It must be some additional layer of programming they’ve added to it. If you need to paste into a Word docx and use the output for business, this is terrible. Deleting hundreds of extra spaces in a long bibliography is brutal. There is software made to remove ChatGPT’s spaces, but really we should be able to instruct this and tell a model to use CMOS, APA, or other style. \n\nThe tone and spacing that current ChatGPT models erroneously default to and drift back to in long context windows is what I’d call Reddit-style or fanfic-style, like:\n\n“And then she stopped. \n\nToo fast. Too long.”\n\nAs you can imagine, this is quite strange in a business context. In long chats you can see the tone move away from business at the beginning to this casual-dramatic style. Custom instructions in a project helps but it still isn’t perfect. You may just have to open a new chat and re-instruct when you see the drift.",

It defines the contract that everything in that thread must obey.\n\nWhat a charter locks\n\nA good charter locks only what must not drift:\n\nCanon / world constraints\nExample (POM): Sigil-only, pre–Faction War, baseline year, no Sigil-Spire physical linkage, etc.\n\nSystem constraints\nExample: server-authoritative, anti-exploit first, deterministic transitions, metric units for engineering, no tabletop CR assumptions, POM-only mechanics.\n\nOutput constraints\n\nRequired formats (inline + RTF/CSV/JSON/ZIP), naming rules, version rules, what constitutes a “major” vs “minor” bump, required manifests.\n\nSourcing rules\n\nWhat is source of truth (uploaded artifacts, internal docs), when public web is allowed, when citations are required.\n\nStop conditions\n\nExplicit “done” definition for the thread’s current phase so it doesn’t balloon.\n\nWhy charters matter\n\nWithout a charter, a long thread drifts in predictable ways:\nConstraint drift (Sigil-only becomes “some planes maybe”)\nMechanics drift (POM-specific turns into generic d20 patterns)\nFormat drift (tables become prose; schemas lose stable columns)\nVersion drift (no clear authoritative “current” artifact)\nSource drift (new assumptions override uploaded canon packs)\n\nA charter prevents this by making violations obviously illegal inside the thread.\n\nCharter scope rule\n\nA charter should be thread-local unless explicitly promoted. That keeps experiments from contaminating other workstreams.\n\nCharter lifecycle\n\nActivate at thread start (or when a thread is repurposed).\nAmend only via explicit patch notes (“replace Section X with Y”).\nSuspend via a stop keyword when you want freeform ideation or different rules.\n\nKickoff prompt\n\nA kickoff prompt is the “work order” that starts a thread (or a major phase). It is narrower than a charter and is written to be executable.\n\nWhat a kickoff prompt contains\n\nA strong kickoff prompt answers only what is needed to produce output without ambiguity:\nRole (who I am in this thread)\nObjective (what success is)\nHard rules (must/never)\nInputs (artifacts, links, canonical packs, what is source of truth)\nDeliverables (exact files + inline structure + packaging)\nVersioning (starting version, bump rules, naming rules)\nQuality gates (validation requirements, audit logs, schemas, test vectors)\nStop condition (when to halt)\n\nWhy kickoff prompts matter\n\nThey prevent:\n“helpful” scope creep\naccidental omission of required artifacts\nformat regressions\nthe assistant defaulting to generic assumptions\nKickoff prompts also make work restartable: you can copy/paste into a new thread and preserve continuity.\n\nHow charter + kickoff prompt work together\n\nThe charter sets the permanent bounds for the thread.\nThe kickoff prompt declares the current mission inside those bounds.\nThink of it as:\nCharter = operating system policy\nKickoff prompt = current process run configuration\nIf they conflict, you follow the charter unless the kickoff explicitly patches the charter.\n\nConserving thread integrity\n\nThread integrity means: “the thread can run for weeks/months and still produce coherent, compatible, buildable outputs.”\nIntegrity threats (and your countermeasures)\n\nContext overflow / memory loss\n\nCounter: keep a Concordance / SPOT index inside the thread: canonical IDs, current version numbers, active constraints, latest artifact links, and a short “current state” section.\n\nContradictory outputs over time\n\nCounter: enforce a single source of truth rule:\n“Latest pack is authoritative unless a patch explicitly supersedes.”\nUse a change log with exact replacements.\n\nSchema drift\nCounter: treat schemas as contracts:\nstable columns/fields\nexplicit migrations\nvalidators + golden test vectors\n\nStyle/format drift\nCounter: lock formatting rules in the charter:\n“Hybrid prose + design-bible” (or whichever is active)\nrequired sections and headings\nunit standards (metric)\n\nArtifact sprawl\n\nCounter: use a packaging discipline:\none bundle per batch (ZIP + manifest)\ndeterministic file naming\nno duplicate “final” files; only versioned supersession\n\nConserving output integrity\n\nOutput integrity means: “every output is internally consistent, compatible with prior outputs, and safe to implement.”\nOutput integrity rules you’re using (implicitly/explicitly)\nDeterministic state + auditability for MMO-grade systems\nServer-authoritative boundaries spelled out\nAnti-exploit reasoning baked into state transitions\nMetric units for implementation fidelity (UE5 cm pipeline)\nNo tabletop defaults unless explicitly mapped\nCanonical constraints enforced as invariants\nVersioned artifacts + change logs\nMachine-readable companions (CSV/JSON/etc.) + validators\nPractical integrity checklist (per batch)\nCanon constraints restated (briefly) and not violated\nSchema unchanged unless migration included\nDeliverables list complete\nVersion bump correct\nChange log includes exact section/table replacements\nTest vectors updated if behavior changed\nManifest includes file hashes/digests (if you’re doing stable digests)\n\nRecommended thread operating pattern\n\nFor long-range subjects, the cleanest pattern is:\nThread Charter v1.0 (locked governance)\nKickoff Prompt Phase A (ingest + audit)\nPhase Output Pack A (RTF/MD + CSV/JSON + validators + ZIP + manifest)\nKickoff Prompt Phase B (consolidate + reconcile conflicts)\nPhase Output Pack B\nRepeat…\n\nEach phase gets:\nclear stop condition\nexplicit delta list from prior phase\npackaged artifacts that supersede prior ones\n\nThe “why this works” in one line\nYour charter/kickoff system turns a chat thread into a version-controlled design pipeline: constraints don’t drift, outputs remain compatible, and every phase is restartable from explicit contracts.",

Overall I like it, but I’m wondering if I'm missing out on other options which might be better to pay for.\n\nI mostly use AI for daily practical stuff, researching, summing up documents or threads, getting second opinions, cleaning up my writing etc. I recently started playing with image generator for content creations and ideas. Here is how ChatGPT summed up my usage:\n\n* Technical troubleshooting (yaml, wordpress, home servers, docker, networking, smart home, cameras, Home Assistant)\n* DIY / home projects (planning before doing anything expensive)\n* Business support (billing, coding logic, emails, contracts)\n* Writing help (emails, explanations, cleaning)\n* Light creative/marketing work (social posts, promos, restructuring content)\n* Translating/simplifying content (technical → plain language)\n* Decision-making and sanity checks (“does this make sense?”, “what am I missing?”)\n\nWhat matters most to me is good reasoning, being able to handle long context without losing track, and explanations that are clear but not dumbed down.   \nWhat I don't like about ChatGPT is that is doesn't handle long conversations i.e. troubleshooting, but I use projects as a workaround where I just start a new chat within a project when I am noticing that gpt is glitching. It is often overconfident while being wrong so I often have to sanity-check. I also need to keep correcting it's responses when it starts using too many emojis and bullet points. The image generator seems limited as well, it often trips when I want it to correct something, or corrects areas outside of my selection.\n\nI've seen people recommend Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity, and all-in-one platforms like Poe, Abacus, or OpenRouter. \n\n\\- Should I stay with ChatGPT or switch to other AI?  \n\\- Is an AIO platform worth it? It would be same price or even cheaper than ChatGPT Plus, but I can't find what would I miss out on with switching to these.",

          "text": "TL;DR: Try Claude if a Projects folder function is more important to you with segregated chats and memory. Try Gemini if long context chats are way more important than a Projects folder function. \n\nGemini has a 1 million token context length, which makes it able to hold many or long documents or longer chat threads in one go. Though there is no projects folder function. \n\nI suggest trying Claude. It handles longer context better than ChatGPT by compacting content past its content window to still be visible in the chat thread. Claude also handles memory better. It can also search historic chat threads and save a manual memory, but it also has an automatic memory generated each night. The automatic memory is a TL;DR of your chat history and what Claude learns about you. The automatic memory and manual memory are served at the start of every chat thread. Claude is also more proactive about managing manual memory if you instruct it to in custom instructions. \n\nClaude also has a stronger Project folder system. You can attach many more files and it’ll index them for RAG.  Each Project also has its own automatic memory and manual memory. What’s great about this is Claude without having to perform a tool call know your progress on a project at the start of every chat thread.",

      "text": "I’ve been using GPT more or less as a second brain for a few years now, since 3.5. Long projects, planning, writing, analysis, all the slow messy thinking that usually lives in your own head. At this point I don’t really experience it as “a chatbot” anymore, but as part of my extended mind.\n\nIf that idea resonates with you – using AI as a genuine thinking partner instead of a fancy search box – you might like a small subreddit I started: r/Symbiosphere. It’s for people who care about workflows, limits, and the weird kind of intimacy that appears when you share your cognition with a model. If you recognize yourself in this post, consider this an open invitation.\n\nWhen 5.1 Thinking arrived, it finally felt like the model matched that use case. There was a sense that it actually stayed with the problem for a moment before answering. You could feel it walking through the logic instead of just jumping to the safest generic answer. Knowing that 5.1 already has an expiration date and is going to be retired in a few months is honestly worrying, because 5.2, at least for me, doesn’t feel like a proper successor. It feels like a shinier downgrade.\n\nAt first I thought this was purely “5.1 versus 5.2” as models. Then I started looking at how other systems behave. Grok in its specialist mode clearly spends more time thinking before it replies. It pauses, processes, and only then sends an answer. Gemini in AI Studio can do something similar when you allow it more time. The common pattern is simple: when the provider is willing to spend more compute per answer, the model suddenly looks more thoughtful and less rushed. That made me suspect this is not only about model architecture, but also about how aggressively the product is tuned for speed and cost.\n\nInitially I was also convinced that the GPT mobile app didn’t even give us proper control over thinking time. People in the comments proved me wrong. There is a thinking-time selector on mobile, it’s just hidden behind the tiny “Thinking” label next to the input bar. If you tap that, you can change the mode.\n\nAs a Plus user, I only see Standard and Extended. On higher tiers like Pro, Team or Enterprise, there is also a Heavy option that lets the model think even longer and go deeper. So my frustration was coming from two directions at once: the control is buried in a place that is very easy to miss, and the deepest version of the feature is locked behind more expensive plans.\n\nSwitching to Extended on mobile definitely makes a difference. The answers breathe a bit more and feel less rushed. But even then, 5.2 still gives the impression of being heavily tuned for speed. A lot of the time it feels like the reasoning is being cut off halfway. There is less exploration of alternatives, less self-checking, less willingness to stay with the problem for a few more seconds. It feels like someone decided that shaving off internal thinking is always worth it if it reduces latency and GPU usage.\n\nFrom a business perspective, I understand the temptation. Shorter internal reasoning means fewer tokens, cheaper runs, faster replies and a smoother experience for casual use. Retiring older models simplifies the product lineup. On a spreadsheet, all of that probably looks perfect.\n\nBut for those of us who use GPT as an actual cognitive partner, that trade-off is backwards. We’re not here for instant gratification, we’re here for depth. I genuinely don’t mind waiting a little longer, or paying a bit more, if that means the model is allowed to reason more like 5.1 did.\n\nThat’s why the scheduled retirement of 5.1 feels so uncomfortable. If 5.2 is the template for what “Thinking” is going to be, then our only real hope is that whatever comes next – 5.3 or whatever name it gets – brings back that slower, more careful style instead of doubling down on “faster at all costs”.\n\nWhat I would love to see from OpenAI is very simple: a clearly visible, first-class deep-thinking mode that we can set as our default. Not a tiny hidden label you have to discover by accident, and not something where the only truly deep option lives behind the most expensive plans. Just a straightforward way to tell the model: take your time, run a longer chain of thought, I care more about quality than speed.\n\nFor me, GPT is still one of the best overall models out there. It just feels like it’s being forced to behave like a quick chat widget instead of the careful reasoner it is capable of being. If anyone at OpenAI is actually listening to heavy users: some of us really do want the slow, thoughtful version back.",

      "text": "**TL;DR:** I’m a non-developer using LLMs for structured, metadata-heavy workflows (literature reviews, lecture prep, Obsidian). Claude impressed me at first, but I encountered workflow shortcuts and vault instability over time. After testing the new Codex Mac app on GPT Pro, I found it more predictable and compliant with strict step-by-step processes. This is about workflow fit, not model superiority.\n\n---\n\nI’m not a developer. I use LLMs primarily for literature reviews, structured lecture preparation, system organization, VPS setup, and managing a complex Obsidian vault with heavy metadata.\n\nFor a long time, I was a user of Claude (Opus/Max). Initially, it was impressive. But my workflows are strict, step-by-step, and highly defined. Over time, I noticed Claude would sometimes optimize the workflow rather than execute it exactly as written. Even with detailed instructions, it occasionally took shortcuts.\n\nThe breaking point for me was Obsidian vault stability. I experienced miswritten front matter, invented tags, and gradual structural drift. I kept expanding the instruction files to add guardrails, but increasing complexity seemed to reduce stability. Simplifying the vault structure didn’t fully solve it. Heavy workflow sessions also quickly consumed the Max quota.\n\nAfter the release of the new Codex Mac app, I decided to test it on the GPT Pro plan.\n\nWhat stood out:\n\n1. It respects explicitly defined workflows. When constraints are clear, it follows them.\n2. It adjusts quickly when corrected and stays within the structure.\n3. It proactively suggests system-level improvements (e.g., weekly vault health checks, metadata validation).\n4. It documents its actions extensively, which makes multi-session continuation easier.\n5. It performs reliably even with a minimal Agent MD configuration.\n\nFor literature review pipelines and structured planning, this predictability matters. I need a model that consistently executes predefined processes, rather than compressing or optimizing them away.\n\nTo be fair, Claude remains strong in writing and can feel more natural stylistically in some contexts. This isn’t a “Claude vs. Codex” claim. It’s more about workflow fit. For my use case, Codex currently feels more controllable and stable for long-horizon, metadata-heavy systems.\n\nIt’s not flawless. It still makes simple mistakes. The difference, in my experience, is that those errors are usually local and easy to correct, rather than structural.\n\nI’m curious how others here approach complex, structured workflows with either system, especially outside pure coding use cases.",

I've found that even Gemini, when given enough context, can really help manage a project end to end. example I'll feed it the prerequisites of a client solution, then ask as many questions as possible to prepare for a workshop and make sure the need is clearly scoped. It works well, but Gemini has become quite lazy with shorter and less detailed outputs\n\nI'm interested in Claude Code for its plan mode, skills and overall structure.

      "text": "I'm fairly inexperienced with AI so I apologize if there are some dumb questions in here. \n\nLong story short, I've been using ChatGPT for about a year to assist with B2B sales. I have a thread where I can post a company's website and it will return an analysis of that company, what their needs are, and where our best in might be. I have a thread for prospect discovery. And I have a thread for drafting quick emails, among a few other threads.\n\nA few weeks ago I had the idea of trying to create a CRM within ChatGPT, to expand on the Google Sheet that I have used over the years for organization, and so far the AI has been useful. But I have some concerns with long term viability:\n\n1.) I've noticed over the past year that ChatGPT does not do well on long threads, whether that be slowing down or losing context. I'm afraid that I'm going to need to create new threads so often that it won't be worth my time, and that I may also lose context while switching over to a new thread.\n\n2.) ChatGPT apparently can't share information between threads? It would be nice if my emails thread had access to my CRM thread. That way I wouldn't have to provide context for each email.  \n\n3.) Redundancy. I'm still using the Google Sheet as a backup, so I'm entering info on the Google Sheet and then pasting it into ChatGPT. If we could remove a step there, that would also be nice. \n\nI really just want something where I can enter the info in Google Sheets, and then find an AI that can get live access to the the Google Sheet. So when I ask it a question or ask it for tasks for the day, it has all of that information without having to load all of the prospect info into a thread. \n\nLike I said, I haven't explored the AI world too much. I just learned about Claude the other day. I downloaded Claude and gave it permission to view my Google Drive. But it is telling me that it can't read Google Sheets? I knew Google had an AI, but didn't realize that Gemini was a full chatbot. So maybe that is the right move? \n\nDoes anyone have suggestions before I put a few hours into just experimenting?",

When you're typing up your prompt, you can select the file from Google Drive, then open it and work with it. Any live changes you make with Google Workspace apps will update the file.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're working on a thread in Google Docs, asking questions or getting info, and you make a change in Google Sheets, it will update in the thread at the same time. Native Google apps can change them. The way I do this is: let's say they upload a Google Doc. I ask it to make these changes, and then open it in Canvas. I've attached a document. In Google Drive, you can select your document. I give it my prompt, select Canvas at the same time, tell it to do this, and then open it in Canvas, because from there, you can see the changes it has made.\n\nI haven't personally worked with Google Sheets. I mostly work with Google Slides and Google Docs, and it's so seamless and smooth that it works perfectly. But I believe Google Sheets is just because Gemini is natively within each Google Workspace app, and there's seamless integration. That's why I think Gemini would be the best option. At the same time, another reason is that Gemini's context window is 1 million tokens. \n\nChatGPT is great, but if you're not using the API, your context window is limited. GPT 5.2 thinking is limited to 196,000 context tokens, but it's limited to a 196,000-context window. However, an API can be up to 400,000, which is a lot. But in Gemini, within the chatbot itself (without using the API), the context window is 1 million, so it can read, synthesize, analyze, understand, and remember much more information.\n\nIn long-term threads and working with larger files/documents like PDFs, Google Sheets, or native Google Labs, Gemini is the best. I would never trust giving ChatGPT, for example, access to 20-30 page PDF articles and then asking questions, working with them, or using them in a paper or report. But I would trust Gemini much more because of the context window, because I know I can tell confidently that it actually reads and assesses them. But ChatGPT, because of its limited context window, once it runs, it will hallucinate when it reaches its limits. Unless, again, you're using an API key, in which case you have up to 400,000 tokens. \n\nAlso, I'm assuming you have a ChatGPT Pro subscription? Keep that because it's great. You have access to GPT 5.2 Pro, and with GPT 5.2, you have access to Heavy Thinking. You have access to much deeper research queries per month and a lot more agent queries. It's just great.\n\nChatGPT, this is just general advice you should know. ChatGPT has the best chatbot experience, and it's a jack of all trades, but I like to say it's a jack of all trades and a master of none. However, their long memory feature is the best. The fact that, let's say, you told it something three months ago, and it remembers, for instance, is just amazing. Let's say you're writing an email and you put your phone number at the bottom, then write a new email months later and need to add it at the end. It'll remember that perfectly. So, its long memory feature is the best.\n\nThe chatbot experience is the best, and with most app connectors like Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Booking.com, Spotify, Apple Music, and so many other tools and apps. Also, its deep research is pretty thorough and actually synthesizes, analyzes, and digests information. It uses reasoning in its deep research.\n\nNow, Gemini, since you have ChatGPT Pro, I'm assuming you do, since you're making this post in this thread. If you have ChatGPT Pro, you don't need to get Gemini Ultra or Gemini AI Pro, which costs the same as ChatGPT Plus at $25/month and gives you many musician limits. For instance, it gives you 100 Gemini 3 Pro queries per day and 25 deep research queries per day. Gemini's deep research is pretty thorough; it's also useful for reasoning. The search takes anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes, and Google's indexing is on par. It has access to the most credible, reliable, and relevant sources when you do deep research with it. If you use any Google Apps, such as Google Sheets, Google Docs, or Gmail, there's no question that you should get Gemini AI Pro, which gives you access to NotebookLM Pro with generous limits as well.\n\nThis is not an ad; I'm just advocating for them because they're actually offering a lot of great tools and features, along with generous usage limits. Gemini is now Google's only product. Google makes a lot of software, hardware, and ads, but ChatGPT is OpenAI's only product (with ChatGPT Atlas as well), and at the same time, it's still ChatGPT. If they're not number one, they're dead, but Google can afford to give people generous limits essentially, and they're experimenting so much by giving these many features, etc. Like in NotebookLM with Gemini AI Pro, you can make 500 notebooks each with 300 sources, and you can make 25 audio reviews, 25 video overviews, and 25 video reviews per day, which is crazy. So, consider Gemini Pro specifically for this use case, and I believe that with Gemini Pro and Chachi on the Pro subscription, you don't need any other AI tool at all.",

      "text": "Matt Shumer mentioned that the model released last week (GPT-5.3 Codex) gave him the sense of something akin to \"judgment\"—a subtle capacity, almost like \"taste,\" to know what is correct—which was once believed to be something AI could never possess. He said the model either already has it, or is so infinitely close that the distinction between the two has become irrelevant.\n\nThis deeply resonates with me. The boundary between AI tools and humans is indeed becoming increasingly blurred. I see ChatGPT and Gemini taking over writing and planning, tools like VOMO automatically summarizing meetings, and Canva replacing junior design work. I do not fantasize that \"learning artificial intelligence\" alone can protect my job forever, but at least I thought it could buy me more time.\n\nBut now, I am increasingly accepting a viewpoint that may be closer to the truth: If you think that \"learning AI\" will protect your job, that may be an illusion. The future workplace may divide into two extremes: either companies fully embrace AI with highly automated processes, or they shift completely toward fields that rely solely on human traits.\n\nIt would be a lie to say I am not anxious—in this gradually blurring boundary, how should we conduct ourselves?",

So the degree to which the alleged author is qualified to use \"I\" is up for debate.\n\n\nEither way, the begged question: *is* it developing taste? Taste is a function of preference, and preference in LLMs is a function of the effect of RLHF on the way the model navigates the results of its training in the grand corpora of human artifacts describing preferences and aesthetics.\n\n\nThe degree to which you can extract what reads to you as \"taste\" depends entirely on how well your taste happens to align with what the model has been told is \"tasteful.\" It's like carving a bust of your own head and then marveling that the bust looks increasingly like you as it resolves, a wooden object and not you in any real sense, but still reflective",

I'm a bit overwhelmed just seeing it all but i'm going to take a deeper look + have ChatGPT help along the way lol. \n\nYou seem pretty smart and I'd like to ask you directly about something. Context drift and memory is a pretty important thing for me as I work through the course of a project and already encountered context drift early amid the project. Without detailing the specifics as it would take a while, it's a project that requires fairly nuanced thinking and reasoning for the conceptual foundation, with a lot of interdependent thing, and consistency on the coding side of things from start to finish is very important, of course.\n\n\nMy research on memory and context a few months back led me to looking into a bunch of options and nothing really stood out much except for Letta.. not sure if you've heard of it but i'll leave a quick LLM summary below that will be better than my explanation and save you the time to look it up.\n\nBut my question is whether you think this could work well with a Letta agent?\n\n\n>Letta is a model-agnostic agent framework that gives an LLM explicit, persistent “agent memory”—most notably editable core memory blocks (updated by you and/or the agent) plus longer-term archival/external memories—so the agent can decide what to read/write each turn to stay consistent. Unlike many “memory” setups that are primarily RAG-only (retrieve top-k chunks from a vector store and stuff them into context), Letta’s distinguishing piece is the structured, always-on core blocks that you can tailor to whatever enduring context you want carried forward (goals, project specs, preferences, constraints, rules), with optional sleeptime-style reflection/summarization to compress recent context into durable notes.",

      "text": "First month paying for ChatGPT Pro and while it has its positives of course, I'm pretty frustrated with an additional glitch I've encountered on multiple occasions, with its negative impact varying in degree.\n\nIt will essentially inject a mini 'referenced this file' label in the middle of a sentence (which sometimes it likely did reference it/it's relevant, and other times the file being referenced definitely has nothing whatsoever to do with the sentence or context surrounding it).\n\nIt looks like this:\n\nhttps://i.ibb.co/zTK2pLQb/image.png\n\n\nAnd the issue is that it completely cuts off multiple words of that sentence it's adding it to. More often than not, it's tough to gauge what the words actually are and I can't fill in the blanks. Only sometimes it's a non-issue or I can gauge what the point being made was, but the notion I should have to play 'fill in the blanks' here is absurd. \n\nMost recent example had 26 instances of this cutting off many words & chunks of sentences. Basically this below, 26 times on repeat scattered throughout the response (approx 1500 words) in my most recent reply on 5.2 Pro with Extended Thinking, after 20 mins of thinking: https://i.ibb.co/zTK2pLQb/image.png\n\n\n\nThis has happened countless times and the most recent one where I counted 26 times was the worst yet. \n\n\nAnd using the 'copy' button doesn't fix it or 'reveal' the missing text. I hoped perhaps it was just a browser related thing, but I checked the Mac app too and it still displays the cut-off sentences/file reference labels.\n\n\nHas anyone else encountered this?",
