Now kratom itself is moderately safe, cheap, and WAY better than the alternative. \n\nUnfortunately, the kratom industry got really good at chemistry and found an alkaloid in kratom that's like 10x stronger than morphine, isolated it, and began selling it as a \"kratom extract.\" It's called 7oh. I thought it was just \"strong kratom.\" I was very wrong. Within a few months I was hooked. \n\nChat gpt helped me first: manage it without judgement and try quitting on my own, multiple times. When that failed, it recommended suboxone. It helped me try to get treatment from a regular doctor, which failed. And when I was pissed off and ready to give up, it steered me to telehealth providers and helped me find one that was quick, affordable, and zero hassle. \n\nIt then helped guide me through the induction (and helped me keep my head on straight and not decide to just give up and go back to taking 7oh). I've now been off kratom and 7oh entirely for almost 2 weeks, and there's no way in hell I would have done it without chat gpt. I'm saving hundreds of dollars a week, I'm feeling more like myself, and I'm finally getting shit done around the house. \n\nI WAS capable of doing it myself, I just didn't believe it. Chat GPT helped me cut through the bullshit I was selling myself, convince me to give it a shot, and helped me through the first few days that were absolute hell (7oh is not a traditional opioid. It affects several other neuroreceptors too, which is what makes withdrawal so awful. It helped me realize the depression, anxiety, flat feelings, etc. were withdrawal from THOSE receptors, not me failing to function on Suboxone). \n\nProud of you dude. Not trying to highjack the thread, just wanted to say I totally get what you mean by having something external say \"hey, hold on. This isn't actually what you want, and this is the errors in your thinking. Try this instead.\" Especially when you're dealing with addiction, and yes—food addiction counts.",

If we establish clear boundaries, verify the facts, and apply the query to five models to discuss the answer, we invariably obtain better results\n\nI also actively integrate web search and a vectorized database to further ground the answers in real data\n\nWhile I haven't yet conducted formal comparative tests of TruthfulQA, during testing I noticed a compelling effect: when using smaller local models (which are more error-prone), they often produce completely different initial answers. However, during cross-validation, the system successfully filters out these individual errors and converges on the correct final answer. This suggests that the system corrects errors rather than accumulates them",

          "text": "I setup your program and tried it out. I like it, but wanted to make some notes.\n\n\n1: I wish you'd not install TTS by default. I don't want all the extra HDD space taken up, but that's me. I changed the install configs to remove the TTS feature before install.\n\n2: I read through the \"steps\" in prompts.py and I think they could use some improvements to the instructions you provide the LLMs. To see what the LLMs thought of your 4 steps, I used kea-research to ask for improvements and here's it's/their response. I do agree with removing step 2 and improving the instructions you send with each step.\n\n\nBelow is the response from the LLMs:\n\n\nYour multi-agent prompt chain is well-designed with a strong foundation in structured JSON, confidence scoring, and a multi-step refinement process. The following critique builds on this solid base to enhance robustness, clarity, and the quality of the final output.\n\nHigh-Level Strategic Recommendations\nRe-evaluate or Remove STEP 2: This is the most significant strategic change to consider. The intermediate synthesis in STEP 2 occurs before the critical evaluation in STEP 3. This risks amplifying or laundering errors from the initial responses before they can be flagged. Removing this step streamlines the process (1 -> 3 -> 4), reduces costs, and ensures the final synthesizer (KEA) works with the raw inputs alongside the complete critical analysis.\n\nSoften the Final Exclusion Rule: The rule in STEP 4, EXCLUDE anything flagged as potential error, is too absolute and can discard nuanced or mistakenly flagged information. A more robust policy would be: \"Review all flagged facts. Exclude them if they are contradicted by a consensus or are unsupported. If a flagged claim represents a key point of contention between reliable sources, present the conflicting information transparently.\"\n\nHarden JSON Enforcement: The instruction \"Respond in JSON only\" is often insufficient. To prevent parsing errors, you should:\n\nIn the prompt: Add explicit constraints like, \"Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object that can be parsed by standard libraries. Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Use double quotes for all keys and string values.\"\nIn your code: Implement a parse-and-repair loop. If parsing the LLM's response fails, send it back with a new prompt asking it to fix the JSON formatting without altering the content.\nDetailed Improvements by Step\nSTEP 1: Initial Generation\n\nGuide Answer Quality: Add instructions for the answer field itself, such as: \"Provide a comprehensive, well-structured, and objective response.\"\nHandle Subjectivity: The atomic_facts concept struggles with creative or subjective questions. Add a fallback: \"If the question is subjective and has no verifiable facts, atomic_facts may represent key claims or assumptions. If no facts/claims apply, the list can be empty.\"\nSTEP 2: Intermediate Synthesis\n\nAs noted, consider removing this step. If you choose to keep it, add strict constraints to prevent it from introducing new information: \"Do not introduce new factual claims not present in the original responses. Synthesize and merge the provided content, citing the source of key ideas using their IDs (e.g., '[A]', '[C]').\"\nSTEP 3: Evaluation\n\nReplace predicted_winner: This field encourages speculation. Replace it with a more actionable field like \"best_response_id\": \"...\", \"reason_for_best\": \"...\".\nMake flagged_facts more actionable: Instead of a simple list, use a list of objects to provide context. For example: \"flagged_facts\": [{\"claim\": \"...\", \"source_id\": \"B\", \"reason\": \"This contradicts a known fact or the consensus of other responses.\"}].\nDefine \"Consensus\": Be specific to guide the model. Add: \"A claim has 'consensus' if it is stated consistently in a majority (>50%) of the provided responses.\"\nAdd Explicit Criteria: Guide the evaluation by listing what to look for: \"Evaluate responses based on correctness, completeness, clarity, and adherence to instructions.\"\nSTEP 4: Final Synthesis (KEA)\n\nHandle Contradictions: Provide an explicit rule for conflicts that aren't clear errors: \"If high-quality responses present conflicting information, do not choose one side. Instead, explicitly state the contradiction (e.g., 'Source A claims X, while Source B claims Y').\"\nImprove Transparency: Add a reasoning field to the output to understand KEA's decisions: \"reasoning\": \"Briefly explain key synthesis decisions, such as how you reconciled conflicting data or why certain information was excluded.\"\nClarify Markdown in JSON: Remind the model that markdown must be part of a valid JSON string, which may require escaping characters: \"The final_answer must contain markdown formatted as a valid JSON string (e.g., newlines escaped as \\n).\"\nCross-Cutting Recommendations\nStandardize IDs and Inputs: Ensure the original question and unique IDs for each response (e.g., A, B, C) are passed consistently to every step. Instruct models to refer to responses only by these IDs.\nAdd a \"No Fabrication\" Rule: Include a general constraint in synthesis steps (2 and 4): \"Do not add factual claims not present in the source inputs unless they are explicitly labeled as general knowledge.",

I use it more like an external thinking space or a live assistant that helps me reduce mental load while I’m in action.\n\nA few ways I personally use it:\n\n\t•\tThinking out loud and adjusting in real time instead of trying to think everything through in my head\n\n\t•\tOffloading things I’m afraid of forgetting so my brain can let go\n\n\t•\tUsing it to unblock complex work or social situations by translating vague intuition into clear words\n\n\t•\tOn heavy days, using it throughout the day as a “live” assistant:\n\n“Here’s everything I need to do.”\n\n“I did this.”\n\n“I’m dropping that.”\n\n“Update the list.”\n\nThis isn’t really a productivity “hack” in the classic sense, but it’s had a real impact on how mentally light or heavy my days feel.\n\nSo I’m curious:\n\n\t•\tWhat’s the most unexpected or unconventional way you use ChatGPT?\n\n\t•\tA use that genuinely reduced your mental load or changed how you work?\n\n\t•\tSomething you wouldn’t have thought to do before using it?\n\nLooking forward to stealing your best ideas.",

It was a big hit at our holiday party.\nEdit: chatGPT also helped me format the menu pages to fit the restaurant style wine list style binder. It also created an accompanying cookbook for the bartender which included tasting notes and adjustments based on different kinds of liquor. For example, some gin recipes do better with a juniper-forward gin.  The cookbook says “If all you’ve got is a juniper forward gin, here’s how you would adjust this recipe.”",

I will typically go back and forth, providing additional context where needed for ChatGPT to assign value/urgency/criticality and do the prioritization.\n\nI do the same at the end of every month, but in reverse.  I brain dump everything I accomplished the previous month and ask it to help me summarize and highlight key milestones or misses, what’s next to keep momentum, and how I can learn or adapt next month.\n\nEdit: Since this comment seems to interest folks, I should add the last step in the flow which is to copy the final output into OneNote and label it with the date.  At the end of the year the OneNote becomes substrate for ChatGPT to summarize the year and help with performance reviews or investor updates etc.",

A good suggested mitigation included giving myself a 24-hour gap between recieving feedback and doing any thinking about it, with the thought that this will allow the emotion to subside and to better be able to consider the feedback logically. Obviously feedback can be a gift, so it's counterproductive to take it negatively versus learning from it.",

Weak ones complain.\nIf someone who shaped modern software development can use AI calmly and pragmatically, maybe the debate isn’t about AI at all.\nSo what do you think?\nIs AI a threat — or simply the next step we’ll all accept soon?",

But I'm realizing there are certain tasks where ChatGPT isn't the best tool even though it can technically do them.\n\nFor example, I tried using DALL-E through ChatGPT to generate professional headshots for my team's website and the facial likeness was way off. The images looked professional but didn't actually look like the people in the reference photos.\n\nA friend mentioned they use [Looktara](http://looktara.com) specifically for AI headshots because it's trained differently and handles facial accuracy better, while they use ChatGPT Pro for everything else. Got me thinking about what other specialized tools people here are pairing with their ChatGPT Pro subscription.\n\nWhat's your current AI stack look like? Are you using ChatGPT Pro for everything or do you have specific tools you prefer for tasks like:\n\n- Image generation that requires precise likeness\n- Video editing or creation\n- Voice/audio work\n- Data visualization\n- Code deployment\n\nTrying to figure out if I should be paying for multiple AI tools or if I'm just not using ChatGPT Pro effectively enough.

Alias of support@ is shared by multiple addresses such as legal, safety, even their e safety forms. You can pick up on routing of email addresses because of their auto responses or just look at mail headers. Use enough legal words, boom - auto routed to legal@ and so on. \n\n2. Despite the alias, the headers indicate a change between SendGrid and GoogleGroups (to my knowledge, there may be more). \n\n3. The signs of being dead ended by a bot are pretty clear because in 1-3 responses, they will repeat your message, have generic names, etc. Best way to confirm is returning back to the origin of the problem and you will see it repeat the same script. \n\n\n\nI know PRO doesn't state the compliance and regulations but Business does and based on what you said being very much the same I encountered, here are issues I identified.\n\nI have removed internal references and identifying information so if something appears incoherent, point it out please/\n\n|Standard / Framework|Control Intent|\n|:-|:-|\n|ISO/IEC 27001:2022|Establish and maintain incident handling procedures|\n|ISO/IEC 27035|Detection, reporting, assessment, response|\n|SOC 2 (Trust Services)|Timely escalation and response to security incidents|\n|GDPR|Protect against unauthorised access|\n|GDPR|Assess and notify personal data breaches|\n|AU Privacy Act|Protect information from misuse/loss|\n|EU DSA|Identify and mitigate systemic risks|\n|CSA STAR|Defined IR processes & effectiveness|\n\n Important: Inclusion of a standard or article does not imply breach.

      "text": "In this post I want to share a popular problem. I used to ask ChatGPT for a finished essay in one shot and the result was usually technically fine, but empty and heartless. It felt like ai writing help without an actual writing process.  \n  \nHere’s the kind of text I kept getting:  \n*“In today’s society, education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals and communities. There are many reasons why education is important, and it can lead to positive outcomes for both people and the economy.”*  \nThere’s no position, no evidence. It’s just safe sentences stacked together.  \n  \nWhat actually improved my output was stopping the one-click “generate the essay” approach and splitting the work into steps: lock the thesis, outline claim → evidence → takeaway. Once I did that, the writing got sharper, more specific and way less cliché.  \n  \nOf course, this won't work for all essays, but in my experience, it usually works 8 out of 10 times. And of course, it requires a lot of attention to detail since each essay format has different requirements.  \nI also noticed that tools built around “structured writing workspaces” can make this easier to stick to. Not because they write better, but because they force the steps. I tried a few options in that category (StudyAgent, Notion templates, Google Docs + outline mode, Obsidian, even Scrivener), and the main difference between them wasn’t the output quality, but how well they keep you inside a workflow instead of letting you jump straight into drafting.  \n  \nHow I formulate my requests:  \nOutline: “Make a 6-8-point outline, thesis + 2 arguments + counterargument.”  \nDraft: “Write an 800-1000-word draft following the outline, highlighting areas where facts/examples are missing.”  \nCritique: “Criticize like an editor. Pay attention to logic, repetition, tone and weaknesses. Give a list of edits.”  \nRevise: “Rewrite with edits applied. Add strong transitions and specifics.”  \nFinal: “Make a final version + a short TL;DR.”  \n  \nHave you ever received a generated text that looked good only at first glance? What are your life hacks for getting really deep and structured pieces? Maybe someone has tested similar services too, what was your experience?",

Yes you still have to be careful, but I stopped overly worrying about using it - it's enabled the productive aspect of research (the writing part) which is what I suck at as an ADHD kid.

I’ve been in that spot where I relied on AI to pull insights together, but I make it a point to keep my own notes and context organized. For me, using something like notebook LM and myNeutron has been a game changer for maintaining context across sessions. It really helps to keep everything aligned and saves a lot of time figuring out what I was doing last week.",
