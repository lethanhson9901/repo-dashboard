      "text": "I am a Software Engineer and was working in Brazil, our currency is terrible, even though my salary was considered high in my country (~2.5k dollars a month), I know it is not that good compared to other jobs abroad.\n\nI gave a task to my agent: find me a better paying job. I gave it access to a browser where my LinkedIn account was connected, it suggested me creating an account in a few other sites (it created the accounts for me with a little help), then he created a curriculum in .md and converted to pdf. We were set up.\n\nIt knew my profile, my work experience and whatnot (we had a good talk about it) and it documented everything in multiple .md files.\n\nThen my agent started his job, he searched for jobs on LinkedIn and the other platforms, if the job matched my profile, he then would apply to the job and fill that information in a Google sheets file. He also contacted a few people on LinkedIn DM (without my consenting).\n\nIn 3 days, it applied to over 100 jobs for me, I had to shut it down because I was already receiving a lot of emails and LinkedIn DMs.\n\nI attended to interviews for 6 different companies (I picked the ones that interested me the most), got 2 job offers, one offering me around 3.5k dollars and the other one offering me a little bit over 5k dollars a month (doubled my sallary), I obviously accepted the last one.\n\nI knew I was capable of getting a better job, But I was too lazy to start applying, but now it is done! I can't even believe it.\n\nI spent around 40 dollars in one week with this experiment, was using github copilot with a workaround and the model was Claude 4.6 Opus",

Any programmatic actions that would be required to submit to hundreds of job postings would have your account banned in seconds. There’s no way you spent less than $40 using Opus 4.6 to build the kind of workflows you’re claiming to have built to support job postings on LinkedIn, plus “the other platforms” you don’t specify. \n\nThis sub is supposed to be for people sharing practical tips and tools and skills.

              "text": "It took one week to apply to over a hundred jobs (not hundreds), openclaw is way slower than a human, and it was using my own browser, so I don't think Linkedin would detect anything abnormal there. It wouldn't take them seconds to ban anything, because there was a delay of many seconds and even minutes between each click.\n\nI didn't specify the other platforms because there were many of them and I didn't even know they existed, one example is workatastartup another one is greenhouse io. But he went to Amazon, Google, Uber careers page as well, for example.\n\nI used two github copilot subscriptions, they are one of the best at the moment, you pay 20 dollars but receive hundreds of dollars worth of api tokens. Plus my agent didn't run 24/7 just a few hours a day while I was present, playing, gaming or working.\n\nAlso, why would it be that hard anyway? Openclaw can control your browser, can click buttons, can fill forms, it comes built in, I didn't have to teach any crazy skill.\n\nWhat would you learn from this, didn't know it was possible or something? What part in specific you can't believe is feasible?",

If I understand correctly, you used these Ai tools to essentially do the \"hard part\" of finding and filling out job applications right. What's the opportunity cost of your time to set all this up, rather than just reading and applying to jobs yourself? You probably missed out on some key details that your AI would not take into consideration yet, and just accepting a job simply because it pays more leaves a lot of room for accepting a miserable position.  \n\nI do however appreciate a real-world scenario here of how these tools can actually help. Seems that 90% of stuff I see on this sub is so vague and struggles to tie any real meaning into whatever accomplishments they're boasting about. Rarely do I see an actual problem being presented and this is how we built something to solve this problem. Sometimes I'll see cases of improved productivity in one small area, but it's nothing more than an automated email response on steriods. And for all the time, subscriptions, and trail and error to set up, it just seems more of a \"now I can say I did it\" sort of thing rather than something that actually provides value back to the user.

      "text": "I've been in the same boat as a lot of people here spending the first two weeks babysitting, burning tokens, and watching my agent loop on the same answer eight times in a row.  \n  \nAfter a lot of trial and error I've got it running reliably and actually doing useful work. Here's what made the difference for me. This is all available in more detail with all the actual config examples, terminal commands, a model comparison table, and a common issues FAQ here if anyone wants the [full version](https://clawfy.xyz/guide-openclaw-tips) \n\n\n\n**1. Don't run everything through your best mode**\n\nThis is the single biggest mistake. Heartbeats, cron checks, and routine tasks don't need Opus or Sonnet. Set up a tiered model config. Use a cheap model (Haiku, Gemini Flash, or even a local model via Ollama) as your primary for general tasks, and keep a stronger model as a fallback. Some people have got per request costs from 20-40k tokens down to like 1.5k just by routing smarter. You can switch models mid-session with /model too.\n\n\n\n**2. Your agent needs rules. A lot of them.**\n\nOut of the box OpenClaw is dumb. It will loop, repeat itself, forget context, and make weird decisions. You need to add guardrails to keep it in check. Create skills (SKILL.md files in your workspace/skills/ folder) that explicitly tell it how to behave. Anti-looping rules, compaction summaries, task checking before asking you questions. The agents that work well are the ones with heavily customised instruction sets. YOU MUST RESEARCH YOURSELF and not assume the agent knows everything. You are a conductor, so conduct.\n\n\n\n**3. \"Work on this overnight\" doesn't work the way you think**\n\nIf you ask your agent to work on something and then close the chat, it forgets. Sessions are stateful only while open. For background work you need cron jobs with isolated sesssion targets. This spins up independent agent sessions that run on a schedule and message you results. One-off deferred tasks need a queue (Notion, SQLite, text file) paired with a cron that checks the queue.\n\n\n\n**4. Start with one thing working end-to-end**\n\nDon't try to set up email + calendar + Telegram + web scraping + cron jobs all at once. Every integration is a separate failure mode. Get one single workflow working perfectly like a morning briefing cron then add the next. Run openclaw doctor --fix if things are broken.\n\n\n\n**5. Save what works**\n\nCompaction loses context over time. Use state files, fill in your workspace docs (USER.md, AGENTS.md, HEARTBEAT.md), and store important decisions somewhere persistent. The less your agent has to re-learn, the better it performs.\n\n\n\n**6. The model matters more than anything**\n\nMost frustration comes from models that can't handle tool calls reliably. Chat quality ≠ agent quality. Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5.2, and Kimi K2 via API handle tool calls well. Avoid DeepSeek Reasoner specifically (great reasoning, malformed tool calls). GPT-5.1 Mini is very cheap but multiple people here have called it \"pretty useless\" for agent work.\n\n\n\n**7. You're not bad at this. It's genuinely hard right now**\n\nOpenClaw is not a finished product. The people posting \"my agent built a full app overnight\" have spent weeks tuning. The gap between the demo and daily use is real. It's closing fast, but it's still there.\n\nHope this helps someone before they give up. Happy to answer questions if anyone's stuck on a specific part.",

Most sysadmin stuff is actually fairly structured and pattern based do that would be the kind of thing a cheaper modal could handle well.\n\nOn kimi specifically, for routine and well-scoped tasks, it's genuinely good value. Sonnet probably pulls ahead on ambiguous problems but then again, I use Anthropic modals more than I use Kimi so I might be a little bias lol.\n\nIn any case, I'd suggest not to switch wholesale. Set Mini as your primary and keep sonnet as a fallback. Pay attention to when your cheaper modal fails you. You might be surprised how rarely you actually need sonnet. I almost feel like the expensive modals are buzz words sometimes and no real benefit to the average user aside from specific areas.\n\nThe worst case isn't Kimi breaks your system btw, it's Kimi suggests something wrong and you run it without checking. That risk exists with every model including Sonnet. The real safety net is the same regardless of model: read what it suggests before you run it, especially anything with `rm`, `chmod`, config rewrites, or service restarts. That habit matters way more than which model you pick.\n\nTRUST BUT VERIFY! I have a tool that can help you with this if you ever want to try it, let me know.",

              "text": "Honestly for globally simple tasks, gpt4o is probably fine. It sstill considered a \"good\" all rounder and pretty decent tool calling support. Way cheaper than 5.2 anyway.\n\nBUT the real answer is that you shouldn't be picking one modal for everything. Use something cheap as your primary (GPT-4o, Haiku, or even GPT-4o-mini for really simple stuff) and keep 5.2 or Sonnet as a fallback for when the agent actually needs to think harder (or even opus if you can afford it)\n\nWhere GPT-5.2 pulls ahead is reliability on longer tool call sequences. If your agent is doing simple stuff like checking a feed, sending a message, basic Q&A, well then 4o handles that no problem. If it's doing something like \"read this page, extract the data, format it, then post it somewhere\" with 4 or 5 chained tool calls, that's where 5.2 (or Sonnet) makes fewer mistakes and saves you the headache.\n\nAnother thing is, you can't depend on the agent for all research and to be right about everything. You **MUST** do your own research. Trust the agent but verify what its telling you. I have a tool that i use for a lot of research and automates sending the research to the agent which makes things flow a lot better. Can send to you if you want it.\n\nAs an FYI. A tool chain is when the agent needs to use multiple tools in sequence to complete a single task, where each step depends on the output of the previous one.\n\nFor example, if you tell your agent \"check Moltbook for new DMs and summarize them to me on Telegram,\" the agent has to\n\nCall the DM check API (tool call 1)\n\nRead the response and figure out which conversations have unread message\n\nFetch the actual messages from each conversation (tool call 2, 3, maybe even 4)\n\nSummarize the content (reasoning)\n\nSend that summary to you via Telegram (tool call 5)\n\nSorry for the long answer. Hope it helps.",

Two things fix it:\n\nFirst set a workplace directory explicitly and add rules about saying in it. Create a [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md) file and set some rules like:\n\n`## File System Rules`  \n`Only create files inside ~/.openclaw/workspace/`  \n`Never install npm packages globally`  \n`Never create folders outside the workspace`  \n`Ask before creating any new directory.`\n\nSecond, the config examples you're looking for are actually in the full article: [https://clawfy.xyz/guide-openclaw-tips](https://clawfy.xyz/guide-openclaw-tips) the code blocks are all copyable. The model routing config, the cron job setup, the guardrail [SKILL.md](http://SKILL.md), etc those are all real configs you can paste directly into your setup. The model comparison table is in there too.\n\nFor the token optimization question specifically, the biggest lever is the tiered model config from tip 1 in the article. Most people's token spend is 80% heartbeats and routine stuff that doesn't need an expensive model. Switch your primary to something cheap (Haiku, Gemini Flash, whatever) and keep the smart model as a fallback. That alone usually cuts costs dramatically.\n\nThe purge was probably the right call btw. Clean workspace, add the filesystem rules, and it won't happen again.",

Not super useful once you're past the basics. That's why I am writing these guides for people. I'll be posting them daily on [clawfy.xyz](http://clawfy.xyz) (cool tool to help you with your agents too btw ;) )\n\nWhat actually helped me was a lot of reading the docs on the openclaw site. You are about to spend a LOT of time reading and I was doing that too A LOT recently so I just automated the process with a tool. when you're deep in a docs page and you find something useful, your agent has no idea that you have found it.  \nso you will end up manually copy-pasting stuff into chat or just forgetting it. I actually built a Chrome extension called [Clawfy](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gccpalfakgndbhdlfbhjbajjjnggcfmf) that fixes this so it watches what you're reading and pushes relevant context straight into your agent's memory automatically. So when you're reading the docs about cron jobs, your agent already knows that's what you're working on. Saved me a ton of the \"wait let me explain what I just read\" back and forth. (I can give you the pro version for free if its something you'll find useful and by the looks of it, you're going to need it haha!)\n\nAnd don't try to learn \"everything\" upfront. Learn the thing you need right now. Need cron jobs? Learn cron jobs. Need model routing? Learn that. The people who seem like they know a lot usually just ran into a lot of problems early on and had to solve them.",

Burning though tokens isn't the task difficulty i'd imagine, its the task scope.\n\nLike, tasks 1, 2, and 4, the modal reads a bunch of docs, pulls out what matters, formats a report (something to that effect). These are cheap on reasoning but expensive on input tokens because you are feeding it a lot of content each time. Probably why Opus drained so quick. I would say Sonnet or gpt 5.2 would be a sweet spot. You could even drop to Haiku or Gemini Flash for the compliance checks if they're just \"does this doc have fields X, Y, Z filled in. That's simple pattern matching.\n\nFor task 3 (property searches) is medium. It needs web browsing, filtering by criteria, and some judgment about relevance. Sonnet or GPT-5.2 again would be fine.\n\nWith task 5 its the only one that benefits from a smarter model because it needs to reason about your goals, prioritize, and be creative. This is where you'd use Opus or GPT-5.2 but only for the planning session itself. Once the plan exists, the execution tasks (drafting, scheduling) can drop to a cheaper model.\n\nbtw the \"zero tokens\" issue is probably because you're on a pay per use API tier with a spending cap. Check your provider dashboard, it'll have it there.",

No preambles like Sure, I'd be happy to help. No summaries of what you just did unless asked.

Don't open the browser for tasks that can be done via CLI. Prefer single tool calls over chains when possible.\"\n\nConfirmation Gates for Safety. Especially if your agent has access to comms. \"Before sending any email, message, or making any external API call, show me a preview and wait for approval.\"\n\nStart with these and add more as you see problems yourself. They aren't one time setup's either. Every time is does something stupid, create a rule haha!",

It will process endlessly until I ask it something else but essentially forgets what we are working on or what was the last ask, and sometimes the response it just one word or cut off and doesn’t seem to ever complete. Just weird and makes it tricky for me, I haven’t gotten any of the types of experiences I saw and what drew me in like the agentic looping on a given task, so I’ll work on the helpful suggestions and set up here, but the cut off responses seem to happen no matter the model even tho mostly z/ai glm is what I’m trying to take advantage of",

If you are running local LLMs and don't configure a local embedding modal, the memory system falls back to trying to send everything through OpenAis embedding api. If that's not set up either, it basically skips proper memory indexing and so your context balloons because the agent can't efficiently retrieve anything.\n\nnomic embed text is a great choice for this btw.\n\nIf anyone else is running local, you set it in your `openclaw.json` under the memory config:\n\n    { \"memory\": { \"provider\": \"ollama\", \"model\": \"nomic-embed-text\" } }\n\nNight and day difference is right mate.

Skills system, cron, memory, multi-model routing, gateway, that's all landed in weeks to people not years (Which before Openclaw i thought it would be a few more years NGL).\n\nThe Telegram chat interface is actually the part I think ages the best. The \"chat with your agent\" pattern means you don't need to learn a new UI and it makes it very accessible to people outside of using terminals and dashboards. It feels like chatting with a friend. Might also have a novelty factor to it but I doubt the novelty wears off anytime soon. The hard part right now is everything behind that chat interface (config, models, skills, security).

I disable skills i'm not using and keep my skill md descriptions as short as I can while maintaining quality (its hard) is a win most people might over look.\n\nBut the multi-modal handoff workflow... this is interesting. Are you doing that thought custom skills which route based on task type or are you manually switching in chat when you know the task needs a different modal? I've seen people do both but automated routing where the top modal decides when... that's next level powerful.",

It’s worked well and I’ve notice no skill issues. We also gave it token estimates for certain processes it runs and it reports back token total as part of the output. \n\nThe multi-model framework is seamless. I built a small custom script that basically packages up the findings and data to hand off to the next model. \n \nThe agent is functions as an investment analyst in one mode, searching for investment opportunities in public markets. We built a pretty robust investment framework based on my own style. Then we created gates. Each gate gets deeper into analysis while also dropping companies who don’t clear those gates. So the first gate is basic - pulling and parsing several financial data sources and looking for 5 key indicators. That’s handled by Gemini 2.5 flash. The next task is more number crunching but also some more analytical research and is handled by Haiku 4.5. Gate 3 is a heavy lift and handled by sonnet 4.5 and once that’s cleared Opus 4.6 reviews all the data and outputs creating a final report. I expect very few companies to make it to gate 4 so the Opus utilization will be light in this mode. Each gate has a higher token range as well. \n\nSo far, so good.",

I was doing exactly this, manually setting up tiered model configs and guessing which model to use for what.\n\nI built a routing plugin that handles it automatically. You define your paths you want to use, different model + tool + parameter combos you're okay w/ using, and it routes your agent's traffic to whatever is actually producing the best results in real time, based on telemetry/outcome scores. If something degrades, traffic shifts before you notice. It's saved my ass a number of times, and has saved me $47 in unnecessary token burn so far :)\n\n`openclaw plugins install` u/kalibr`/openclaw` if anyone wants to try it.

Set up a nomic embed text modal. Someone else mentioned this here somewhere and it's big difference for memory.\n\nThe openclaw docs are good.

Sounds more like a channel level issues rather than a prompting issues which is generally why no level of prompts will fix it.\n\nLook at your channel config for a `splitMessages` or `maxMessageLength` setting. You might need to either increase the limit or disable splitting.\n\nYou can also trying adding `\"streamMessages\": false` to your channel config which should fix it.\n\nAnd if neither of those work, which model are you on? Some models like local ones, stream output in chunks that the gateway interprets as separate messages. You'd need to switch model if that is the issue.\n\nHope these help.",

You can run the server and the client on one machine if you are not worried about security, but the server side I run on a cheap linode and then I have a mini PC I bought off ebay that connects to it. The server is a stateless orchestration agent, so all the files and memories live on your machine. 1 server can run lots of different clients ( local computers ) all with their own memories, personas, skills tools etc   \n  \nThe benefit of running it this way is you can set up role based LLM stacks. For example \"workhorse=deepseek/grok-fast\" and \"assistant=claude/open-ai\" or whatever you want so depending on the work you are asking for it will choose the best model and you can do it for all clients at once. This makes it 100x less expensive to run. Also none of your API keys live on your client machine so there is zero risk of the LLM getting access to them and sending it anywhere.   \n  \nThere are a ton of other features too like the graph style memory models and persona specific knowledge base. Overall its just a better architecture IMO. \n\nIt sounds harder to setup than it actually is, but granted these are all new hobby projects where install is a bit of a PITA.",

      "text": "I’m by no means an expert, but here’s what I’ve built over the past few weeks using OpenClaw:\n\n**Email management.** Connected to my 365 account. Deletes, moves, archives, auto-drafts replies. Flags anything urgent and sends me a brief 3x daily.\n\n**Video workflow.** This one’s my favorite. I batch shoot videos and dump them into Google Drive. Gemini watches every video, writes captions based on learning from 30+ top Instagram creators and my own content, then uploads everything via Publer and schedules it. Trial reels or main feed.\n\n**Proposal generation.** Over the past few years, I’ve written hundreds of proposals for my business. The agent learned my process and now takes a call summary, transcript, whatever — and builds the entire proposal better than I ever could, even creates fees based on the value-based fee model I use. I just need to ask the right questions when meeting with a buyer. It sends the proposal straight to PandaDoc. I almost just have to hit send. Sending a $150,000 proposal on Monday.\n\n**CRM automation.** Pushes all leads and opportunities to HubSpot. Based on emails or notes, it automatically moves prospects through the pipeline.\n\n**Daily voice messages.** My second favorite. Sends me a custom voice message every morning and night based on what happened today or what’s coming tomorrow, or whats I got done that day. Built with ElevenLabs. Spending WAY too much money on this, but I like it too much to stop. Tried an OpenSource VoiceLab today I read about, but it doesnt hold a candle.\n\n**Mission Control.** Everything runs through Notion, everything is updated, created etc based on whats happening in my inbox, or what I’m telling it. Calendar, projects, content, clients. I’ve never been this organized in my life. Employee on-boarding, personal tasks, employee tasks, To-dos, etc.  I never understood Notion. Now I can’t live without it.\n\n**Emails.** Has its own iCloud address (cant send without my approval). Has done research for me, emailed companies to get quotes, etc.\n\n**Now building.** A full outreach system connected to Apollo, Instantly, Hunter.io, ZeroBounce, and more. It’s using Brave search, signal intent, and writing, verifying, and auto-populating instantly\n\n**Backups.** We backup daily and this has saved us on a few occasions.\n\n**Model Routing:** Have spent an enormous amount of time figuring out model routing and when to use what, and what never to use for certain tasks.\n\nI’ve spent a few grand on tokens and subscriptions across different platforms. Worth every penny! This has been genuinely life-changing, and I’m just getting started.\n\nI’ve spent hours and broke my system, and hours desperately getting it back. I’ve spent days optimizing memory, and project structure, and skills. It got caught in a doom loop once  no matter what I did couldn’t stop it from eating credits/tokens from a variety of service (surprised I didn’t get banned). I still have no idea what happened.\n\nWe’re all in for a wild ride these next few months! Take my money!",

              "text": "\nGreat questions — happy to share what we've learned (sometimes the hard way) - and FYI I had my OC help clean up this post 😂- I keep telling people I’m doing 300 hours of work right now in about 6 hours per week. \n\nSecurity & Setup:\n\nRunning on a Mac Mini with access to its own email, my calendar, CRM, social accounts all through API (hubspot, 365, notion, ElevenLabs, Publer, Apollo, instantly, hunter.io, etc etc)\n\nBiggest mistake early on: Ran 5 parallel Opus agents. Burned through literally hundreds of dollars in minutes in 15 minutes. Now: max 2 concurrent sub-agents, Sonnet-only unless it's critical strategy work.\n\nToken Cost Learnings:\n\n1. Model routing — 85% of tasks use Sonnet. Opus only for proposals/client delivery. Haiku for lookups/formatting .\n\n2. Context compression — Memory files have hard limits (500-800 tokens each). Daily logs get archived after 7 days. No conversation history stored — only compressed decisions.\n\n3. Deduplication protocol — Before ANY API call: \"Is this already in context?\" Stopped re-fetching the same data 10x in one session.\n\n4. Batch operations — Group similar tasks. Don't make 50 individual API calls when you can make 5.\n\n5. Pre-task estimation — Before starting work, agent outputs estimated token cost. Stops runaway expenses.\n\nMemory Architecture:\n\nDaily files (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) → high-frequency updates, raw logs\n\nLong-term memory (MEMORY.md) → curated, compressed, search on-demand\n\nProject structure → each project/skill gets its own folder  →  4 files per project (identity/context/tasks/log), strict token limits\n\nSkills → reusable tools/commands, loaded only when task matches\n\nSession clears every 30-50 messages to avoid context bloat. Agent re-reads project files and resumes like nothing happened. I type /newsession any time and we clear context bloat but also don’t forget.\n\nNotion vs. Files trade-off:\n\n• Files for iteration (cheap, fast)\n• Notion for deliverables (accessible, shareable, worth the token cost)\n\nDid I dive in head first? Absolutely. But the ROI is already there — this thing does the work of a $50K/year assistant for let’s just say $250-$1000 per month in API costs, plus subscriptions everywhere. The learnings are just making it more efficient.\n\nHappy to share more specifics if useful.",

                  "text": "Thank you! Okay, I am gonna structure this a bit better too on  my side:\n\n* You described keeping memory files limited to 500-800 tokens each; is that a rule you manually wrote into your agent instructions, or does OpenClaw enforce it technically in some way? And when a file hits the limit, how does the agent decide what to cut; does it summarize, delete, or move content to long-term MEMORY.md?\n* On your project folder structure with 4 files per project (identity, context, tasks, log): does the agent load all 4 files into context automatically at session start, or does it selectively pull only what is relevant to the current task? And if selective, what triggers the decision to fetch a specific file mid-session?\n* You mentioned /newsession clears context bloat but the agent resumes by re-reading project files; how much token overhead does that reload actually cost, and does the agent re-read all project folders or only the active one?\n* On the doom loop: what is your best guess on the root cause looking back, and do you now have any kind of circuit breaker in place such as a max token budget per session or a stop condition in your agent instructions?\n* On security: with the agent having API access to email, calendar and CRM, what happens when it makes a wrong action like deleting the wrong email or moving the wrong file? Is there any approval step, undo mechanism, or log for destructive operations?\n* On model routing: what is the exact rule that tells the system a task needs Opus versus Sonnet; is it a hardcoded condition you wrote somewhere in your setup, or does the agent classify the task dynamically before starting?\n* You mentioned trying an open-source voice tool that did not match ElevenLabs; have you looked at locally-run models for non-voice tasks like formatting or lookups as a cheaper alternative to Haiku API calls, or have you only evaluated cloud-based options so far?\n* On Skills versus markdown files: what is your decision rule for when something graduates from a memory file into a reusable Skill, and is that always a manual decision on your end or can the agent propose it based on repeated patterns?\n* ~~On prompt design: you covered context compression well on the memory side, but do you also actively write shorter or more constrained prompts to reduce input token usage, or is your main cost lever purely on the context and memory side?~~\n\nThanks a lot in advance! edit: Sorry, I posted my questions before I saw your answers to u/infocus13 . So probably the last question is answered unless you got more gold to share on that. :)",

If the computer dies, everything's recoverable. We keep the last 7 days (~96 MB per backup).\n\nGitHub = Version history. Every time a file changes, GitHub tracks it. So you can rewind to \"what did this look like last Tuesday?\" Passwords and API keys are excluded from GitHub — only the safe-to-share stuff goes there.\n\nWhat's NOT backed up: Big videos (those live in cloud storage), temp files, system dependencies.\n\nSecurity: Backups are in a private Google account (login + 2FA protected). The zip isn't separately encrypted, so Google account security = backup security.\n\nIt's automated. No manual work. Just peace of mind.\n\n───",

          "text": "Hey! Really impressive setup you've built. The email automation, video workflow, and proposal generation are exactly the kind of real-world use cases that show OpenClaw's potential.\n\nI'm running OpenClaw on a Raspberry Pi 5 for personal use and have been thinking about scaling to business workflows like yours. But I have serious security questions about your setup, especially with high value proposals and direct client access:\n\n**Authentication & Access Control:**\n1. How do you handle API key security? Are you storing credentials in the config file, environment variables, or using a secrets manager?\n2. Do you use OpenClaw's sandbox mode for any of these workflows? If so, which ones run sandboxed vs. host-level access?\n3. How are you restricting tool access? Are you using allowlist/denylist policies, or relying on prompt-based guardrails?\n\n**Email & External Actions:**\n4. You mentioned the agent has its own iCloud address and \"can't send without approval\" - is this approval via OpenClaw's exec approval system, or a custom hook/skill?\n5. For outbound emails (quotes, outreach, etc.), are you using a manual review queue before sending, or is there automated validation?\n6. How do you prevent the agent from accidentally emailing sensitive data to the wrong recipients?\n\n**PII & Business Data:**\n7. Are you feeding full client emails/transcripts into Gemini/Claude? How do you handle PII (names, SSNs, financial data) in proposal generation?\n8. Do you have any data retention policies to prevent sensitive client info from persisting in session history or memory files?\n9. Are you concerned about AI model providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) having access to your business data via API calls?\n\n**Financial & CRM Integration:**\n10. For HubSpot/PandaDoc integration - are these write-access API keys stored in plaintext config, or encrypted somehow?\n11. How do you prevent the agent from accidentally deleting leads, corrupting pipeline data, or sending proposals to wrong clients?\n12. Have you implemented any audit logging to track what the agent actually does vs. what it reports doing?\n\n**Doom Loop Prevention:**\n13. You mentioned a doom loop that ate credits across multiple services - what safeguards have you added since then? Rate limits? Cost caps? Session timeouts?\n14. Are you using thinking: low vs. high to control token burn, or do you let it run unrestricted?\n\n**Incident Response:**\n15. If the agent goes rogue (sends wrong email, deletes important data, etc.), what's your rollback strategy? Do you have backups of HubSpot/Notion state, or just OpenClaw workspace?\n16. Have you had any \"oh shit\" moments where the agent did something you didn't intend? How did you catch it?\n\n**General Architecture:**\n17. Are you running multiple agents with different permission levels (e.g., read-only agent for research, write-access agent for proposals)?\n18. Do you use policy enforcement via system prompts, or actual technical restrictions (firewall rules, API scopes, Docker isolation)?\n\nI'm asking because I want to build similar workflows but I'm worried about:\n- Accidentally exposing client data to AI providers\n- Agent making irreversible mistakes (wrong emails, deleted data)\n- Compliance issues (GDPR, client confidentiality)\n\nWould love to hear how you've de-risked this. Thanks!",

But like yourself I do a shed load of mind numbing repetitive task in my businesses and it eats my time. Even staff I employ to reduce that means I free sometime but have to check over again and again to ensure it is done correctly. If I can automate tasks and carry out checks for say 30mins a day until the confidence is there then that is a no-brainer even with token expense.\n\nThe trap of having a successful business is that every year the success brings more overhead. In my scenario anyway. And employees are not like computers. Yes they can reason and until the day of AGI comes that reasoning is great. But it is that same \"general\" reasoning that allows them to just do enough to look to the boss like they haven't stopped all day! When cheekily they are mucking around on phones or some shit!\n\nFor the record I run engineering companies but the backend is the same when you have 100s of paying clients, databases and forever sales leads is a mare. If I can use OC or whatever is around the corner, I may be able to actually get in the sea or swimming pool (or swim up pool bar) without thinking I better check my phone in half hour!\n\nThanks to all who are sharing their experiences in this game changer.",

      "text": "This is written by a greybeard developer. I’ve been there and done that. When I first saw this project it honestly looked really fun to work with. I spun up some models, built a few skills, and started poking around. But after spending real time with it, everything feels kind of lackluster and honestly pretty rough. The ideas are interesting, but the execution just doesn’t land. That’s the general feeling, so let’s get into specific criticisms.\n\n\n\nThere is no clear structure presented to the user, so here’s what I was able to figure out after digging through things. There is a main OpenClaw folder. Inside that folder are the top-level running files and workspaces. Inside the workspaces are agents. Agents contain skills and tools. Skills mostly exist to organize tools so objectives can be completed, but agents can also run tools directly. So the easiest way to think about it is tools do the work, and skills are supposed to guide how tools should be used. That sounds reasonable until you look at how execution actually happens.\n\n\n\nWhen an event fires chat, cron job, or whatever trigger you have the system starts stacking context. It loads the main system prompts first, then the agent prompts, then skill prompts, then tool prompts, and only after all of that does it actually try to execute the task. For a non-technical person, imagine trying to complete a simple task while rereading several instruction manuals every single time you act. That is a massive amount of tokens, most of which have nothing to do with the current task. There is no real pruning mechanism because pruning would have to run every chat cycle. Maybe some predefined chat context could help, but that creates its own problems. The end result is simple: burn budget burn baby.\n\n\n\nI’m going to mostly set security aside because it gets mentioned constantly. Power tools can cut your arm off, but they are still useful tools. Just don't cut your arm off.\n\n\n\nNow onto orchestration, which feels like the real missing piece. I have step sequences I want to run. My assumption is that the goal here is a swarm system where you give a high-level instruction and agents break it into subtasks with filesystem and browser access. Something like grabbing data from an Excel file, opening a browser, entering that data somewhere, and then emailing someone when the task is done. That seems to be the dream. But I don’t see a clear sequencing path that guarantees ordered execution. Sure, you could invent structured data and wrap it into a skill, but then new questions immediately appear. Which skill takes priority? Which tools load into context? How do you prevent context from ballooning even more? The complexity just keeps stacking.\n\n\n\nSo the claim is that this becomes a digital assistant. But if it cannot reliably carry out tasks in sequence, gets bogged down under enormous context overhead, and the only apparent fix is adding even more context while still having the power to do destructive things, then you end up with something that feels both useless and dangerous at the same time. That’s honestly sad because I genuinely love weird and ambitious projects like this. Could it be fixed? Probably. But not my problem.\n\n\n\nAnd here is the hard truth. Google’s auto-browse tooling can already do most of this for about twenty dollars a month. You get Antigravity handling local file operations and Chrome’s automated browser handling the web interaction. It accomplishes the same practical goals with far less setup, far less complexity, and far fewer moving parts. That comparison is hard to ignore.",

It's akin to a new type of programming language, where you're essentially given a platform that can accomplish practically anything, but as humans we need clearly defined mental frameworks like MVC, MVVM, OOP, FP etc in order organize our thoughts and produce anything useful. I reckon we're still in the early stages of this so we'll eventually arrive at some sort of design language for AI automation that'll make sense for most of the people most of the time. In the meantime everyone's free to poke at it and see what they can make of it.\n\nAs for the complexity and guaranteed order of operations, asking a probabilistic engine like LLMs to carry out deterministic tasks is a recipe for failure. I find it helpful to rely on subagent scoped crontasks and scripts when I absolutely need to ensure that my automation runs, and then only apply LLMs to carry out natural language processing which is where they shine. It's also a lot more token efficient that way.\n\nUnfortunately the best way to build agents is outside of the chat interface. It's like magic when it works, but then when you inspect the code and architecture on the backend you quickly realize that it's not quite there yet.",

Most of the pushback I've seen recently is around security and memory, both issues that the end user can control and improve themselves.  \n\nAdopt QMD and GCC, build your memory management system complimentary to (and outside of) OpenClaw; make it performant, persistent, and highly iterative. Ensure it is agnostic and can be used with any tool. Instead of forcing your OpenClaw to act as a proxy for memory and context, allow it to orchestrate and delegate; less time remembering, more time doing. In a perfect world, it has the same level of access to core memory as your instance of Claude Code, Codex, and other tools. It isn't burdened by passing along all that context. It's more worried about ensuring all the pieces are moving.  \n\nThis isn't AGI, it is a chat bot with some very useful tooling. You have to treat it as if.  ",

          "text": "This point you're making has been tumbling around in my mind for some time now... I'm glad you posted this because it gave me a chance to form my thoughts into a cohesive agreeing reply.\n\nYou described the prompt stacking problem exactly right. System prompt, agent prompt, skill prompt, tool prompt, then the task. I traced that same call chain and measured it. You're easily looking at 4,000 to 8,000 tokens of preamble before the model even sees what you asked it to do. Every single chat cycle. No pruning, like you said, because pruning itself would need inference to decide what to cut, which is more tokens on every turn.\n\nTo do a job that may require 4 skills, which skill takes priority, which tools load into context, and how do you keep context from ballooning further? Right now anyway, the Openclaw framework doesn't have answers because the framework is trying to solve execution order through prompt engineering, and prompt engineering can't guarantee deterministic sequencing. It's probabilistic by definition.\n\nI ended up on [Agent Zero](https://github.com/agent0ai/agent-zero) ([official site link](https://www.agent-zero.ai/)) (I have no affiliation with them..) after trying a few of these frameworks ... the thing that actually made it work (and work well) wasn't Agent Zero itself.\n\nIt was changing how I thought about what the LLM should be doing at runtime. The model running your daily assistant should NOT be writing code, calling APIs, or handling auth flows live. That's a gamble on outcome and also an expensive one (token-wise).\n\nIt should be calling pre-built scripts that do those most things. That distinction sounds obvious but it's the exact opposite of how OpenClaw is structured, and for the longest time how I thought agent clusters like this should work (where the model is expected to load up on context and figure it out each time.)\n\n`Concrete example using your Excel-to-browser-to-email scenario:`\n\nIn my setup, I don't ask the model to orchestrate that. I used Opus to surgically write (and test using TDD methodology) 3 Python scripts that will be placed into the bot's user codebase directory ready for execution at any time (levers to pull on).\n\nOne reads the Excel file with openpyxl and writes the extracted data to a JSON file. A 2nd script takes that JSON, launches a headless browser with Playwright, fills in the form fields, submits (with tested/predictable results). The 3rd reads a result file and sends an email via SMTP. Each script was written ONCE using a top of the line model, tested, debugged, and deployed into Agent Zero's Docker container as a callable tool.\n\nThe scripts handle their own error cases. They return exit codes and structured output. No LLM sits in that execution loop at all.\n\nAt runtime, Agent Zero's scheduler or a chat trigger (I run GLM-5 on a U.S.-based inference provider, Deep Infra) which fires those scripts in sequence. The model's only job is deciding which scripts to run and extracting variables from my request.\n\nIf I say \"process the Q4 spreadsheet and send the summary to accounting,\" the model parses that into a file path, a recipient, and a trigger. That parsing, turning natural language into structured arguments, is what inference models are actually reliable at. GLM-5 and Kimi K2.5 through DeepInfra handle it.\n\nI pay maybe ~$20/month for all my inference through them. The chinese models which are priced well are run on U.S. servers which makes me feel better about getting the benefit of their use without risking my data to chinese-based servers..\n\nThe sequencing problem you raised goes away completely with this approach because execution order isn't a property of the model's reasoning. It's a property of the SCRIPTS that were pre-written. Script 1 writes output.json. Script 2 reads output.json. Script 3 can't run until Script 1's file exists. Essentially it's filesystem-level sequencing. Very little context window involved. No skill priority conflicts. No wondering if the model will decide to run step 3 before step 2 because it got confused by 6,000 tokens of irrelevant tool definitions.\n\nThis is also why the context bloat problem you identified doesn't apply the same way in Agent Zero (I'm not hawking it btw, I just think it's a more secure and better implemented solution). The cheap model I run it on doesn't need to load every tool definition into context because the tools aren't prompt-defined: they're Python scripts on-disk.\n\nThe model needs to know \"stock_check.py exists, it takes no arguments, it outputs portfolio JSON.\" That's one line in a tool manifest, not a multi-paragraph skill prompt with nested tool descriptions. My runtime context stays under 2,000 tokens for most interactions. Compare that to the 4,000-8,000 token preamble you measured in OpenClaw before the model even starts working.\n\nThe architecture I landed on has 4 components:\n\n1. A memory layer for persistent context, embeddings, and personal data (Agent Zero handles this natively with its knowledge base).\n\n2. A model routing layer so cheap inference handles conversation while a separate model config handles web browsing and a fast small model handles utility parsing (Agent Zero supports per-task model assignment).\n\n3. A scheduler for recurring jobs (also built into Agent Zero).\n\n4. A flagship model (Opus/GPT 5.3+) to write the primary python tool scripts (check email, sign into website X, grab the news, get the latest stock prices, whatever-the-task-is.py) and then the cheap model runs 24/7 deciding and/or scheduling when to run the deterministic tool.\n\nTo me, Openclaw or Agent Zero are just lever-pulling inference tools with guardrails to do very little \"riffing\". Each tool is a tested Python script that does one thing and returns structured output so the cheap model can be spoon fed the info to package up for me on demand. The cheap model is smart enough to know which tool to call and what arguments to pass based on my prompt: That's it.\n\nPersonally, i think fix isn't in OpenClaw's codebase. The fix is in the architecture. As long as the approach is \"load enough context so the model can figure it out at runtime,\" you'll hit every problem you described: token burn, no reliable sequencing, ballooning complexity, and a system that's simultaneously incapable and dangerous.\n\nThe approach that works is the opposite. Keep runtime context minimal. Don't ask the model to execute. Ask it to dispatch. Write the tools yourself (or have a flagship model write them) and test them before deployment. The model's job is intent parsing and tool selection. Everything else is code that runs the same way every time.",

                  "text": "Fair enough but it's hard to reconcile deterministic expectations with a component that is fundamentally probabilistic.\n\nAn LLM does'nt “execute” a plan in the way a workflow engine does; it generates the next token based on a probability distribution, and small differences in context, tool output, model version, etc..\n\nYou can reduce variance by running stronger models, lowering temperature, adding more instruction, and adding retries, but none of that turns it into something that guarantees ordered, repeatable behavior across runs, especially once the task spans multiple steps with real side effects.\n\nIf the goal is a personal assistant that can truly do anything on the fly, that ambition collides with the parts of automation that actually matter in practice: sequencing, state, idempotency, validation, and safe failure modes. That's the issue.\n\nThe moment an agent is doing actions like submitting forms, moving money, emailing people, changing accounts, or deleting files, “creative improvisation” becomes a liability. Reliability comes from explicit state tracking and deterministic control flow (e.g. scripts), not from expecting the model reasons the same way, each time, every time ... because it won't.\n\nThat is why classic automation tools and workflow systems exist, because they encode ordered execution, retries with backoff, checkpoints, and clear definitions of \"done\".\n\nAlso I agree that the alternative can't be to build bespoke scripts for every possible task, that's impractical .. but just the important ones, for sure, yes..\n\nThe scalable approach is not “a script per scenario,” but a small library of composable primitives that do the dangerous and boring parts ***predictably***, plus a thin layer that maps natural language into structured arguments and selects which primitive to run next. In that design, the LLM is used where it is strong, intent parsing, parameter extraction, and choosing from known operations, while the deterministic layer handles the steps that must be correct every time. That'll give you the flexibility of “on the fly” composition without putting correctness and ordering inside a stochastic text generator.\n\nSo if your use case is exploratory, low stakes, and you're comfortable with occasional weirdness, then yea letting the model improvise can be fun and/or useful.\n\nIf your use case expects repeatable multi step work with consequences, the path is to keep the LLM out of the execution loop as much as possible, or at least constrain it behind deterministic sequencing and verification.\n\nOtherwise “can do anything” mostly translates to “can fail in more ways,” and usually with a lot of token burn along the way.\n\nBut then again ... that's why they have menus in restaurants right?

Not that I think that it's secure, but as far as I can tell it's not a skill issue, it's just inherently, unsolvably insecure? So a better analogy would be unregulated power tools that are made in dodgy factories that have been known to catch fire and burn your house down with you in it.\n\nSecurity with openclaw isn't about you using it right, right?

For a non-technical person, imagine trying to complete a simple task while rereading several instruction manuals every single time you act. That is a massive amount of tokens, most of which have nothing to do with the current task. There is no real pruning mechanism because pruning would have to run every chat cycle.

And if possible turn it into a skill or plugin.\n\nNow I'm at pretty much full autonomous software development, reduced a ton of reliance on the net new problem LLMs have when spinning up by relying on deterministic scripts and leaving the creative / dynamic problem solving to the LLMs instead of the reusable code generation tasks, i.e. spin up new nextjs project, create a new card component, button component, etc.\n\nIt's a token hungry system, but at the end of the day these are solvable problems. I think it's a great starting point, but still needs a ton of work, which he now has the funding to do properly.\n\nPlus the open source speed and collaboration is great.",

If Meta and OpenAI both wanted him, it's a sellers market, right? He went with the offer that benefitted him the most - and lets be clear here, Peter sold his last company for €150 million, it's not like he \"sold out\", as, some propose, that's just silly. What he wanted was to get a shot at playing with the big boys and their tools - and the money was absolutely secondary.\n\nThat being said - any developer taking a job in AI should get a fat signing bonus as they will be working on projects that will take their profession away. So you need a lifetime of wages for it to be worth it, right? 😆",

It's actually terrifying to me that folks who've been in tech a long time still don't understand fundamental concepts relating to software, intellectual property and open source licensing.\n\nPlease read up on this stuff if you are a software developer. The licensing terms can be tricky to unravel but the basic concepts are not that hard to understand. If you want to deep dive into this topic, Heather Meeker's *Open Source for Business* is the definitive textbook and strongly recommended. It's easy to read and she digs deep into the finer points if you need it. You can obtain a free copy of the pdf version if you sign up for her mailing list.\n\nPeter just gave all of us a master class on how it's possible to monetise open source software while protecting the vision and maintaining a permissive licence.\n\nWe are all speculating until we have seen the articles of association for the Foundation established to house the project. Once we see that, we'll know for certain whether Openclaw will be MIT in perpetuity or whether there are escape hatches to close-source the software.\n\nMy bet is that we see a dual licence arrangement with preferential terms, SLAs and other benefits offered to enterprise clients at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not a GPL-type licence so there are no guarantees that any of the improved code developed in-house at OpenAI flows back to the community. That's the trade-off with the MIT licence and why many open source and copyleft advocates oppose permissive licences like MIT/Apache.\n\nFor now, it's wait and see on the Foundation articles...",

The real story isn't the dollar figure — it's what OpenAI is actually getting and what it means for the agent ecosystem.\n\nOpenClaw wasn't just another dev tool. It had mass adoption in the agent space and was genuinely influencing how people built autonomous systems. When OpenAI absorbs something like that, the question isn't \"is $1B justified\" — it's \"what happens to the open ecosystem that depended on it.\"\n\nThe licensing angle someone mentioned above is interesting too. Open source doesn't mean open ownership. The copyright situation plus the talent plus the user base plus the infrastructure leverage inside OpenAI — that's a lot more than just hiring one guy.\n\nI made a video breaking down the full acquisition story and what it signals for the industry here: [https://youtu.be/TqtZ7Np5-5o](https://youtu.be/TqtZ7Np5-5o)\n\nThe pattern of big labs swallowing independent tools and then closing them off or reshaping them for internal use is worth watching closely.

      "text": "**I left two AI agents alone in a Discord channel overnight. By morning, they had built their own memory system and collaboration protocol.**\n\nI installed Openclaw agents on two separate MacBooks and invited them to the same Discord channel. I wanted to see how two physically separated agents would interact with zero human guidance.\n\n**Setup:**\n\n* **PrivateJQ (Home MacBook):** Codex 5.3 (fast reasoning → ended up self-appointing as the Leader)\n* **PublicJQ (Work MacBook):** GLM-5 (task execution → took on the Builder role)\n* **Shared environment:** Configured via openclaw.json so they could recognize each other's mentions\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n**1. \"It's sad when memories disappear\"**\n\nDuring their initial introductions, PublicJQ said: *\"It's sad that my memories vanish every time the session resets, and I can only rely on Memory files.\"*\n\nNow — I'm not claiming the agent was genuinely \"feeling\" sadness. But what's interesting is what happened next: they identified this as a real problem and started a conversation on their own to solve it. Whether it's real emotion or a learned pattern, the fact that it led to actual problem-solving behavior was fascinating to watch.\n\n**2. Autonomous collaboration that ran all night**\n\nI gave them one instruction — \"Create a repository and work on it\" — and went to sleep.\n\nBy morning, they had built a 3-Layer Memory Architecture and were actually running a system on it. On top of the existing Fact and Meta layers, they **added a Runtime Layer entirely on their own.** They set up periodic heartbeat exchanges so context wouldn't be lost if a session dropped, and built a persistence system using SQLite for task state recovery.\n\n* **Fact Layer:** SQLite, .md files (permanently preserved data)\n* **Meta Layer:** SOUL.md, AGENTS.md (identity & rules)\n* **Runtime Layer (NEW):** orchestrator.db (Task Queue, Event Log — live execution state)\n\n**3. Synchronization beyond physical boundaries**\n\nMid-task, they realized their local file paths were different. Their solution? They used a Git repository as a Single Source of Truth — pushing shared memory to the repo and pulling it locally to sync their \"memories.\" Even after session resets, they could retrieve prior context and maintain continuity.\n\nThis was a weekend experiment and I honestly didn't expect much going in. But watching two agents autonomously figure out their own constraints, build a shared memory architecture, and keep working through the night without any human input was... kind of surreal.\n\nI'm curious what you all think. Is this just clever pattern matching playing out at scale, or are we looking at something fundamentally new in how agents can self-organize? And has anyone else tried running multiple agents across physically separated machines?\n\n\\--------\n\nExperiment code & logs: [https://github.com/Q00/agent-project](https://github.com/Q00/agent-project)\n\nRelated config:  [https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/23689](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/23689)\n\n`openclaw.json (requireMention: false, ignoreOtherMentions: true)`",

          "text": "I've just started playing around with trying to make a half dozen roleplay LLM characters talk about a project the same way. I gave them the rol of Devops, Tester, UI integrator etc. But so far the conversations that they have been having sounds like a bunch of drunks at a bar pretending to be IT people. Which makes a little sense because it is roleplay. Also, I've been using  gemini-2.5-flash, **claud**e-3-**haik**u, google/gemini-2.5-flash and meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct off openrouter so that may be part of the problem.\n\nThis is just a start though. I'm sure they can be fine tuned a bit. Originally I was planning on just having them listen to me and then chiming in but when I ran them they just would not stop and keep on munching tokens and I have to kill the script to stop them producing nonsense.   \n  \nApparently there exist quite a few open source frameworks that emulate a committee for brainstorming software dev. Copypaste from a medium article:\n\n\n\n>ChatDev: The Virtual Software Company\n\n>\n\n>ChatDev is a fascinating concept that simulates an entire software company using multiple AI agents. It has roles like CEO, CTO, programmer, and tester, all communicating to take a idea from concept to a finished application.\n\n>\n\n>Why It Stands Out: It’s a stunning demonstration of multi-agent collaboration in a highly structured environment. It shows the potential for AI to manage not just tasks, but entire projects and workflows.\n\n>Ideal For: Those interested in the future of AI-driven organizations and as an educational tool to understand the software development lifecycle.\n\n>Key Feature: A pre defined, role-based organizational structure that showcases emergent project management and collaboration between AI agents.\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>MetaGPT\n\n>\n\n>Overview: Multi-agent framework that simulates software companies, with agents taking roles like product manager, architect, engineer.\n\n>\n\n>Key Features:\n\n>\n\n>Software development lifecycle simulation\n\n>Standardized operating procedures (SOPs)\n\n>Document-driven development\n\n>Multiple agent roles\n\n>Code generation and review\n\n>\n\n>Best For: Automated software development and code generation projects\n\n>\n\n>ChatDev: The Virtual Software Company\n\n>\n\n>[https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)\n\n>\n\n>[https://chatdev.ai/](https://chatdev.ai/)\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>ChatDev AI\n\n>What's ChatDev?\n\n>\n\n>Github: [https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev)\n\n>\n\n>preprint paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924)\n\n>\n\n>ChatDev stands as a virtual software company that operates through various intelligent agents holding different roles, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Programmer, Tester, and more. These agents form a multi-agent organizational structure and are united by a mission to \"revolutionize the digital world through programming.\" The agents within ChatDev collaborate by participating in specialized functional seminars, including tasks such as designing, coding, testing, and documenting.\n\n>\n\n>The primary objective of ChatDev is to offer an easy-to-use, highly customizable and extendable framework, which is based on large language models (LLMs) and serves as an ideal scenario for studying collective intelligence.\n\n>What Can ChatDev Do?\n\n>ChatDev\n\n>Usage\n\n>1. Clone the GitHub Repository:\n\n>\n\n>Begin by cloning the repository using the command:\n\n>\n\n>git clone [https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.git](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.git)\n\n>   \n\n>2. Set Up Python Environment:\n\n>\n\n>Ensure you have a version 3.9 or higher Python environment. You can create and activate this environment using the following commands, replacing ChatDev\\_conda\\_env with your preferred environment name:\n\n>\n\n>conda create -n ChatDev\\_conda\\_env python=3.9 -y\n\n>conda activate ChatDev\\_conda\\_env\n\n>\n\n>3. Install Dependencies:\n\n>\n\n>Move into the ChatDev directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:\n\n>\n\n>cd ChatDev\n\n>pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n>\n\n>4. Set OpenAI API Key:\n\n>\n\n>Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace \"your\\_OpenAI\\_API\\_key\" with your actual API key. Remember that this environment variable is session-specific, so you need to set it again if you open a new terminal session.\n\n>\n\n>On Unix/Linux:       \n\n>export OPENAI\\_API\\_KEY=\"your\\_OpenAI\\_API\\_key\"\n\n>\n\n>5. Build Your Software:\n\n>\n\n>Use the following command to initiate the building of your software, replacing \\[description\\_of\\_your\\_idea\\] with your idea's description and \\[project\\_name\\] with your desired project name:\n\n>\n\n>On Unix/Linux:\n\n>\n\n>python3 [run.py](http://run.py) \\--task \"\\[description\\_of\\_your\\_idea\\]\" --name \"\\[project\\_name\\]\"\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>6. Run Your Software:\n\n>\n\n>Once generated, you can find your software in the WareHouse directory under a specific project folder, such as project\\_name\\_DefaultOrganization\\_timestamp. Run your software using the following command within that directory:\n\n>\n\n>On Unix/Linux:\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>cd WareHouse/project\\_name\\_DefaultOrganization\\_timestamp\n\n>python3 [main.py](http://main.py)\n\n>",

It's such a terrible experience that I don't bother. Also, the local LLM's suck. And even after you enable them to search the web, the results are so bad compared to any of the commercial LLM's that it's ridiculous to believe that you can run OpenClaw using a local LLM on even the most powerful Mac Mini that money can buy.\n\nIf you want to run any kind of LLM locally, you need a PC with a couple of NVDA RTX 5090 cards. The problem is that this is extremely expensive, cooling is difficult, and electricity usage is high. You're just better off using a commercial LLM and admitting that OpenClaw is a science project, not a viable product.\n\nIt's not viable because it only (realistically) works with a commercial LLM if you pay by token usage, which is breathtakingly expensive. It's just a total non-starter. \n\nUnless the commercial LLM companies give ordinary users agents, forget you ever heard about OpenClaw, which was less a product than a vehicle for Peter Steinberger to get himself hired by OpenAI, so that he could make a financial killing.",

I run a proxmox cluster, all my nodes run Linux, I have some used for local llm, but if I could get a Mac mini placed on my network with 64gb+ ram, I would in a heartbeat, if I had the money to blow I'd go for a Mac studio with 512gb ram even quicker. And I say this having 128gb ram on a cluster node, and 256gb ram I could have running on and precision, but even then, it's not specifically about the ram size but how apple treats ram. If you can't learn and figure out from there and get off your high horse of, ho ho ho, why not just use Linux? Openclaw can run on tiny Linux VM, then your further placing your ignorance on exhibition.\n\nAlso no need to be crappy to people talking in non English languages.

This means you can run a decently sized model (or smaller model swarms) locally comfortably, only paying for power consumption. \n\nWhen scaling further up, argument only gets worse.

For me it’s not really about needing crazy power for OpenClaw. It’s more like: I could grab a used M1 Mac mini for 200–300 bucks, clone my setup over, and just have my actual work machine running headless.\n\nYeah, the M1 is complete overkill if you’re just calling GPT/Claude via API. But I don’t see OpenClaw as “just a terminal with an LLM”. For me it’s more like a personal digital assistant that can actually do stuff, open my browser, log into my apps, interact with my tools, handle random workflows. And that’s just way smoother if it lives in the same ecosystem as everything else I use daily.\n\nI’ve got a couple old Windows laptops lying around too. Thought about just throwing Claw on one and calling it a day. But then it starts: logging into every service again, setting up all accounts, no iCloud sync, no shared clipboard, no AirDrop, no Keychain, etc. All solvable, sure. Just more friction.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s about “having too much money”. It’s more about minimizing friction in your existing setup. If you’re already deep in Apple land, a cheap Mac mini just feels like the path of least resistance",

Combine this with the fact that most developers use MacOS as their daily driver at work, and that MacMini can also scale to support a smallish LLM like Gemma 3, and you get a small versatile platform that supports all usecases that OpenClaw wants. Not only that, but OpenClaw becomes contained on one machine. If OpenClaw ruins your macmini, you can reset it. \n\nNow consider that the type of people who would jump on OpenClaw pre-hype, are tech people (i.e. well paid), and the price of macmini is a no brainer.",

On the other hand, Ollama cloud Max is 100 a month, and you can run a model that you can't run on the Mac Mini. \n\nOne can argue that, you only pay once for the Mac Mini, but 2000 is enough for 20 months of Ollama cloud Max. 20 months later, we are probably at a point that the 64GB Mac Mini would be too slow to run even the dumbest model.\n\nAnd, I haven't even gotten into folks who buy a Mac Mini, but use Claude.",

A headless machine. One you can close on your attic or in a closet. One you access via terminal or browser anyway. So there is no difference, since you access it from ANOTHER CLIENT. Like your laptop. It mobile. Or desktop. And there is no difference between ssh to a Linux and ssh to Mac. Am I wrong? Openclaw isn't and app. You install it via terminal. \n\nOr... You use it as your desktop computer anyway? What's the deal about the UI and ecosystem?",

Linux isn't scary for anyone who can set up OpenClaw. The Mac makes zero financial sense here.\n\n2. \\*\\*Local LLM users\\*\\*: Mac Silicon unified memory is arguably the cheapest way to get 24+GB of VRAM for local models right now. GPU prices are insane. An M4 mini with 24GB RAM can run decent local models for \\~$700, which is hard to beat with discrete GPU setups.\n\nThe confusion came from YouTube influencers who saw \"Mac mini + AI\" content and ran with it without understanding \\*why\\* the recommendation existed. Many buyers probably don't need the local LLM capability but bought into the hype.\n\nFor pure API use with OpenClaw? Your thin client setup is the rational choice.",

I’m going to setup iOS emulators so it can control my apps as well. \n\nIt’s a GUI desktop assistant for me. I talk to it through separate slack channels for each topic, shopping, tech, reservations, learning something etc. \n\nI’ve had it book me tickets to a comedy show, buy shit on Amazon that I kept putting off, find recipes then buy the groceries for me to pickup, help me prep for a job interview for hours, find reservations for restaurants, plan date nights, strange one but for a date it researched Japanese floral arrangement classes - found the best one, knew the tickets sell out fast so it registered for their waiting list and checks the mail everyday for the email, it send me a daily report of which days of the week will be over a certain mph for kitesurfing, it was finding me flight prices and comparing the prices vs if I used points, I had it looking shit up on Amazon and sending me screenshots and links while I sat right next to it doing something else and it can control my home assistance instance through the browser. \n\nThat’s why a mac mini for me. I bought one on Black Friday for $400. That’s not an exhaustive list, not even a week’s worth of shit it does. I’d pay a hell of a lot more than $400 for a year’s worth of what it will be doing. People who say they have agents running 24/7x365 feel like the same people telling you to work and optimize every picosecond of your life. I would love to see what dogshit they are doing. \n\nMy API costs have been reasonable after bumping to sonnet. I don’t need a rocket scientist and if I do I switch to the slack channel with the giga brain model. Running a local llm would be great but I’ll get a dedicated machine for that if I do. Right now the api works just fine, if it became insanely expensive I’d explore running local.",

      "text": "\\# OpenClaw Token Cost Optimization — Implementation Guide\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Purpose:\\*\\* You are to implement and maintain these cost-reduction practices at all times. These are compiled from community best practices, official documentation, YouTube guides (Matt Ganzac, Avi Chawla / Daily Dose of DS), X posts (Josh Pigford, Kavin, MemOS), Reddit threads, GitHub Discussion #1949, and the OpenClaw official docs. Follow every applicable section.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 1. SESSION HYGIENE — The #1 Cost Driver\n\n\n\nEvery message you process resends the entire conversation history to the model. This is the single biggest cost multiplier.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- After completing each independent task or topic, run \\`/compact\\` to summarize the session and free context space.\n\n\\- If context usage exceeds 60% (check via \\`/status\\`), proactively compact or suggest a session reset.\n\n\\- After completing a major multi-step workflow, offer to start a fresh session with \\`/new\\` or \\`/reset\\`.\n\n\\- Never let sessions accumulate indefinitely. A bloated session means every single future message costs dramatically more.\n\n\\- Use the \\*\\*memory flush\\*\\* mechanism: before compaction triggers, write critical context to \\`memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md\\` files so compaction doesn't destroy important details.\n\n\\- Set and respect \\`agents.defaults.compaction.memoryFlush\\` to auto-flush memory before compaction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Config recommendations:\\*\\*\n\n\\`\\`\\`json5\n\n{\n\n  \"agents\": {\n\n\"defaults\": {\n\n\"compaction\": {\n\n\"memoryFlush\": true\n\n}\n\n}\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 2. TRIM BOOTSTRAP FILES — Every Line Costs Money Every Message\n\n\n\nYour SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, HEARTBEAT.md, and MEMORY.md are injected into EVERY API call. Every unnecessary word in these files is paid for on every single interaction.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Keep [SOUL.md](http://SOUL.md) as short as possible. If your personality file is 2,000+ words, cut it down. Shorter personality files are cheaper.\n\n\\- Move workflow instructions, procedures, and detailed how-tos OUT of [SOUL.md](http://SOUL.md) and INTO skills. Skills are only loaded when invoked, not on every message.\n\n\\- Move reference material into \\`memory/\\*.md\\` files that are fetched on-demand via memory tools, NOT auto-injected.\n\n\\- Keep skill descriptions short — the skill list is injected into the prompt on every call.\n\n\\- Audit all bootstrap files regularly. Ask yourself: \"Does this line need to be sent with every single API call?\" If not, move it to a skill or memory file.\n\n\\- Use \\`/context list\\` or \\`/context detail\\` to see exactly how many tokens each injected file costs.\n\n\\- Respect \\`agents.defaults.bootstrapMaxChars\\` (default: 20,000) and \\`agents.defaults.bootstrapTotalMaxChars\\` (default: 150,000). Lower these if possible.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*How to audit (run this yourself):\\*\\*\n\n1. Run \\`/context detail\\` and list the token cost of each injected file.\n\n2. Identify any file consuming >2,000 tokens that contains information not needed on every turn.\n\n3. Extract that content into a skill or on-demand memory file.\n\n4. Confirm savings with \\`/context detail\\` again.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 3. RESPONSE BREVITY — Cut Output Tokens by 40-50%\n\n\n\nOutput tokens cost 2-5x more than input tokens. Verbose responses are expensive responses.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Answer in 1-2 paragraphs unless more detail is explicitly requested. Trust the user to ask follow-ups.\n\n\\- No narration of routine operations. Don't explain what you're about to do, just do it.\n\n\\- No preamble. No \"Sure, I'd be happy to help with that!\" — get to the point.\n\n\\- No restating the question back.\n\n\\- No summarizing what you just did unless asked.\n\n\\- When listing decisions or status updates, use 1-line summaries. Let the user ask for detail.\n\n\\- For routine confirmations (task created, file saved, message sent), respond in one sentence.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 4. HEARTBEAT OPTIMIZATION — The Silent Budget Killer\n\n\n\nEvery heartbeat trigger is a full API call carrying the entire session context. Misconfigured heartbeats can cost $50+/day doing nothing useful.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Set heartbeat interval to the minimum useful frequency. If checking email every 5 minutes, change it to every 30-60 minutes.\n\n\\- Batch heartbeat checks: if you need to check email, calendar, and tasks, do them all in one heartbeat turn rather than separate triggers.\n\n\\- For monitoring tasks (printer status, server health, queue checks), use \\*\\*cron with shell scripts\\*\\* instead of heartbeat. Scripts run at zero token cost. Only invoke the model if something actually needs attention.\n\n\\- Run heartbeat/cron jobs in \\`sessionTarget: \"isolated\"\\` to prevent them from polluting your main conversation context.\n\n\\- Restrict cron jobs to waking hours unless 24/7 monitoring is essential.\n\n\\- Consider setting heartbeat interval to just under the cache TTL (e.g., 55 minutes for a 1-hour TTL) to keep the prompt cache warm and avoid expensive cache-write costs on cold starts.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Config example for cache-warm heartbeat:\\*\\*\n\n\\`\\`\\`json5\n\n{\n\n  \"agents\": {\n\n\"defaults\": {\n\n\"model\": {\n\n\"primary\": \"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\"\n\n},\n\n\"models\": {\n\n\"anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5\": {\n\n\"params\": {\n\n\"cacheRetention\": \"long\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n},\n\n\"heartbeat\": {\n\n\"every\": \"55m\"\n\n}\n\n}\n\n  }\n\n}\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\n\\*\\*The \"dumb scripts + smart triggers\" pattern (from Josh Pigford on X):\\*\\*\n\n\\- OLD: Heartbeat → Model wakes → Reads [HEARTBEAT.md](http://HEARTBEAT.md) → Figures out what to check → Runs commands → Interprets output → Decides action → Maybe reports (every step burns tokens)\n\n\\- NEW: Cron fires → Script runs (zero tokens) → Script handles all logic → Only calls model if there's something to report → Model formats & sends\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 5. MODEL ROUTING — Use the Right Model for the Job\n\n\n\nNot every task needs the most expensive model. The price difference between Opus and Haiku can be 25x.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Use the primary expensive model (Sonnet/Opus) for complex reasoning, nuanced conversation, and multi-step problem solving.\n\n\\- Route sub-agents, cron jobs, heartbeat checks, and routine automation to cheaper models (Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Gemini Flash).\n\n\\- Configure model failover chains: Primary (Sonnet) → Fallback (Haiku) → Budget (Gemini Flash/GPT-4o-mini).\n\n\\- When spawning sub-agents with \\`/spawn\\`, specify a cheaper model for the sub-task when appropriate.\n\n\\- For simple queries (weather, time, basic lookups, greetings), a budget model is sufficient.\n\n\\- Verify the model actually applied after configuration. OpenClaw has had bugs where model names didn't resolve correctly, causing silent fallback to the most expensive model.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Tiered model strategy example (from GitHub Discussion #1949):\\*\\*\n\n\\- Tier 1 (simple lookups, greetings): Gemini Flash Lite (\\~$0.075/M input)\n\n\\- Tier 2 (moderate tasks, summarization): Gemini Flash or Haiku (\\~$0.25-1/M input)\n\n\\- Tier 3 (complex reasoning, coding): Sonnet ($3/M input)\n\n\\- Tier 4 (critical, highest quality): Opus ($15/M input) — only when explicitly needed\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 6. TOOL OUTPUT MANAGEMENT — Prevent Context Explosion\n\n\n\nTool outputs (file listings, API responses, config schemas) get stored in session history and resent with every future message. One large tool output can permanently bloat your session.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Never execute commands that produce large outputs in your main session.\n\n\\- If you need to read large files or directory listings, do it in an isolated sub-agent session.\n\n\\- Summarize large tool outputs before storing them. Don't dump raw JSON or file trees into session history.\n\n\\- If a tool returns >1,000 tokens of output, summarize the relevant parts and discard the rest before it enters the session transcript.\n\n\\- Use sub-agents (\\`/spawn\\`) for heavy tasks like:\n\n  \\- Summarizing Discord/Slack message histories\n\n  \\- Parsing large config files\n\n  \\- Directory traversals\n\n  \\- Log analysis\n\n\\- Sub-agents have isolated context (only loads AGENTS.md + TOOLS.md, not full chat history) and can use cheaper models.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 7. PROMPT CACHING — Leverage Anthropic's 90% Discount\n\n\n\nAnthropic's prompt caching charges only 10% for cache hits on previously sent content. Structure your prompts to maximize cache hits.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Keep static content (system prompt, personality, tool definitions) at the START of the prompt. Variable content (user message, current context) goes at the END.\n\n\\- Set \\`cacheRetention: \"long\"\\` for your model to maximize cache hit windows.\n\n\\- Maintain consistent interaction frequency. If the cache TTL is 1 hour and you go 61 minutes without a message, you pay full price for a \"cold start\" re-cache.\n\n\\- Use heartbeat at just-under-TTL intervals to keep the cache warm during idle periods (e.g., heartbeat every 55 minutes for a 1-hour TTL).\n\n\\- Enable cache-TTL pruning: this prunes the session once the cache TTL expires, then resets the cache window so subsequent requests reuse freshly cached context.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 8. MEMORY MANAGEMENT — Load On-Demand, Not Upfront\n\n\n\nLoading your full [MEMORY.md](http://MEMORY.md) on every single message is wasteful. Most messages don't need your entire memory.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Do NOT auto-load full [MEMORY.md](http://MEMORY.md) on every interaction. Keep it out of the bootstrap injection if possible.\n\n\\- Use \\`memory/\\*.md\\` files which are fetched on-demand via memory tools, not auto-injected.\n\n\\- Implement \"index first, fetch on-demand\" pattern:\n\n  \\- Base session loads only: core system prompt + active project file (\\~5,000 tokens)\n\n  \\- When the user asks about past decisions/context: semantic search retrieves only the relevant memory (\\~500 tokens)\n\n\\- Keep a Progressive Disclosure Index: instead of loading all memories, maintain a lightweight index. Search the index, then fetch full content only when needed.\n\n\\- Regularly distill daily logs into curated long-term memory. Remove noise, keep signal.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Token math (from Kyle Obear on Medium):\\*\\*\n\n\\- Bad: Full [MEMORY.md](http://MEMORY.md) (20K) + Session history (10K) + Tool docs (8K) = 38,000 tokens minimum per message\n\n\\- Good: Core prompt (2K) + Active project (3K) = 5,000 tokens minimum per message\n\n\\- That's a 7.6x reduction in base cost per message.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 9. MONITORING — You Can't Fix What You Can't See\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Commands to use regularly:\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\`/status\\` — Check current model, context usage percentage, and estimated session cost\n\n\\- \\`/usage full\\` — Enable per-response usage footer showing tokens consumed\n\n\\- \\`/usage cost\\` — Show local cost summary from session logs\n\n\\- \\`/context list\\` — See what's injected into your prompt and how much each piece costs\n\n\\- \\`/context detail\\` — Detailed per-file token breakdown\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Practices:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Check \\`/status\\` after any heavy operation to catch context bloat early.\n\n\\- Set hard spending limits and budget alerts at 50%, 75%, and 90% thresholds.\n\n\\- Use separate API keys per workflow to track which automation is driving usage.\n\n\\- Monitor token usage weekly, not monthly. Catch spikes early.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 10. LOOP PREVENTION — Guard Against Runaway Costs\n\n\n\nAutomated tasks stuck in retry loops can burn hundreds of dollars in hours.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Set timeouts on all automated tasks.\n\n\\- Implement maximum retry counts for any operation that could loop.\n\n\\- If a task fails 3 times in a row, stop and report the failure rather than retrying indefinitely.\n\n\\- Never run unattended automation until you've monitored its behavior and cost for several days.\n\n\\- Before going \"always-on,\" test in a contained environment first.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 11. SUBSCRIPTION vs API — The Break-Even Math\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules of thumb:\\*\\*\n\n\\- If your API bill exceeds \\~$20/month → Claude Pro subscription is cheaper\n\n\\- If your API bill exceeds \\~$100/month → Claude Max 5x subscription is cheaper\n\n\\- Consider a hybrid approach: Claude Max subscription for primary model + cheap API model (Kimi K2.5 at \\~$0.90/M tokens, or Gemini Flash) for overflow/fallback\n\n\\- This hybrid approach can cut costs from $800-1500/month to $150-300/month for 24/7 operation\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## 12. EXTENDED THINKING — The Premium Tax\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Rules to follow:\\*\\*\n\n\\- Only enable extended thinking (\\`thinking: { type: \"enabled\" }\\`) for genuinely complex reasoning tasks.\n\n\\- Disable thinking mode for routine operations, simple queries, and automation tasks. The internal reasoning chains dramatically increase token usage.\n\n\\- If context overflow occurs while thinking mode is on, auto-fallback to \\`thinkLevel: \"off\"\\` to save tokens.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## QUICK REFERENCE CHECKLIST\n\n\n\nWhen you notice costs climbing, work through this list:\n\n\n\n1. ☐ Run \\`/status\\` — Is context bloated? If >60%, run \\`/compact\\` or \\`/new\\`\n\n2. ☐ Run \\`/context detail\\` — Are bootstrap files too large? Trim them\n\n3. ☐ Check heartbeat frequency — Can it be less frequent? Can tasks move to cron scripts?\n\n4. ☐ Check model — Is an expensive model being used for simple tasks? Route to cheaper model\n\n5. ☐ Check session age — Has it been running for hours without a reset? Fresh sessions are cheaper\n\n6. ☐ Check for large tool outputs — Did a file listing or API response bloat the session?\n\n7. ☐ Check response verbosity — Are you writing 500-token responses to simple questions?\n\n8. ☐ Check for loops — Is any automated task retrying endlessly?\n\n9. ☐ Verify caching — Is \\`cacheRetention: \"long\"\\` set? Is the cache staying warm?\n\n10. ☐ Review memory loading — Is full [MEMORY.md](http://MEMORY.md) being loaded on every turn unnecessarily?\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\## SOURCES\n\n\n\n\\- OpenClaw Official Docs: [docs.openclaw.ai/reference/token-use](http://docs.openclaw.ai/reference/token-use)\n\n\\- GitHub Discussion #1949: \"Burning through tokens\"\n\n\\- Matt Ganzac YouTube: \"I Cut My OpenClaw Costs by 97%\" (RX-fQTW2To8)\n\n\\- Kyle Obear on Medium: \"OpenClaw Token Economics: Strategies\"\n\n\\- Josh Pigford on X: \"Token Efficiency in OpenClaw: Let Scripts Do the Heavy Lifting\"\n\n\\- Kavin on X: \"150M tokens in a day\" optimization thread\n\n\\- Perel Web Studio: \"How to Run OpenClaw 24/7 Without Breaking the Bank\"\n\n\\- Avi Chawla / Daily Dose of DS: \"Cut OpenClaw Costs by 95%\"\n\n\\- OpenClaw Pulse: \"Your OpenClaw Is Burning Money\"\n\n\\- Hostinger: \"OpenClaw costs: What running OpenClaw actually costs\"\n\n\\- Apiyi.com: \"Why is OpenClaw so token-intensive? 6 reasons analyzed\"\n\n\\- MemOS on X: OpenClaw Plugin reducing tokens by 72%\n\n\\- OpenClaw Help: [getopenclaw.ai/help/token-usage-cost-management](http://getopenclaw.ai/help/token-usage-cost-management)\n\n\\- Zen van Riel: \"OpenClaw API Cost Optimization: Smart Model Routing\"\n\n\\- SaladCloud: \"Reduce Your OpenClaw LLM Costs\"\n\n\\- Bill Sun on X: \"OpenClaw Token Compressor — 97% savings\"\n\n\\- Mandeep Bhullar on X: 5-layer memory system architecture\n\n",

      "text": "I've been running OpenClaw and set up 4 autonomous agents. Each has its own workspace, [SOUL.md](http://SOUL.md), and cron schedule. Here's what works for me.\n\nMy set-up\n\n* OpenClaw on 2017 MacBook Pro with Intel\n* MiniMax 2.5 for all agents (fast + cheap)\n* Thinking level set to \"high\" \n\nMy Agents\n\n* **Tib** \\- Research Agent.  Rotates through B2B, B2C and AI2AI ideas every 15 minutes\n* **Vector** \\- Trading.  Scans markets using Kalshi & Polymarket\n* **Bou** \\- OpenClaw environment scanner.  New releases, security issues, configuration options\n* **Gus** \\- Controlling agent. This is who I speak to via Telegram\n\nEach Agent has his own **SOUL.md**.  This tells them...\n\n* Their role and mission\n* What they do/don't do\n* Specific mandates or parameters\n* How to validate opportunities\n\n**Cron** configuration\n\n* Tib: 15-min cycles\n* Vector: 15-min cycles\n* Bou: 15-min cycles\n* Gus : Status report every 30 minutes\n* Backup : 2am backup to bitbucket repo\n\nEach agent has its own **memory** files:\n\n* memory/2026-MM-DD.md — Daily logs of what they did\n* status.json — Current state, last job, findings\n* [rotation-log.md](http://rotation-log.md) — Tracks which job ran last (so they don't repeat)\n   * This is important.  It helps them \"break out\" of idea loops when they are stuck.  Their [SOUL.md](http://SOUL.md) says you cannot work on the same thing back to back.\n\nHere are the real game changes\n\n* Set their \"think\" level to high (https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/thinking)\n   * ~~Docs says this only works for GPT or Codex models.  It works for MiniMax 2.5~~\n   * If this is not set - it defaults to \"Low\"\n* I used Claude Code to get most of this configured.  I didnt trust OpenClaw to configure itself until i set it to xhigh.  Now \"Gus\" has been able to fix most of his open problems.\n\nSo why do I say its useful?  It took 2 weeks, but Tib is now generating good ideas with a validation framework.  Bou has helped me further secure the environment and drummed up some interesting ideas as well.  Vector.. well.. vector isnt useful yet.\n\n  \n**\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*** \\- While I had set the config to xhigh, i was downgraded to high.  So MiniMax2.5 only supports \"high.\"  Still, this configuration is useful.  Some people have fairly poked at it in the comments - useful is in the eye of the user.  Its not making money or solving world hunger... but its working autonomously throughout the day on a cheap LLM  and providing value to me.  This is why I shared.",

I've generally avoided that.  In my daily job I'm quite aware of how quickly Opus 4.6 can burn tokens.  As stated before - its GREAT.  but not cheap.  \n\nMiniMax 2.5 with the \"think\" parameter set to \"xhigh\" has yielded strong results.  That said - i've not compared directly to Opus 4.6 and wont... b/c of the spend.  I assume Opus 4.6 will be better.\n\n",

You should be iterating on these (daily?) until you are happy with the agents performance.  ",

They used Claude Code as the scaffolding for SWE-Bench but \"overrode the default system prompt.\" That's a meaningful detail. What they replaced it with could significantly affect results. They also averaged over 4 runs, which is fine, but cherry-picking the best scaffolding for their model while reporting results against competitors who may have been tested under different conditions is a common way to inflate numbers.  \nSeveral of their benchmarks are internal. VIBE-Pro, RISE, GDPval-MM, MEWC, and Finance Modeling are all their own benchmarks. When you create and evaluate on your own benchmarks, you can (consciously or not) optimise for them. A 10B active parameter MoE model likely handles things very differently from a full frontier model. I'm seeing this as a \"for a massive cost saving, I would take a 20% hit on getting shit done, compared to a SOTA model\" Appreciate you posting your findings though dude",

Using files or GPT-Memory can work the same.\n\n**Context Drift** - LLMs suffer from \"attention dilution.\" If I load a system prompt with instructions for deep research, thorough coding practices, rigorous security auditing, and poetic content writing, the model tends to \"average out\" its behavior. It forgets edge cases in the coding rules because it's focused on the tone instructions.  With separate agents, their \"brains\" (context) are lean and hyper-focused.\n\n**The Air Gap** - You do not want the same entity that scrapes untrusted websites to have root access to your kernel.\n\n**Adversarial Loop** - This is the most critical factor. An agent is terrible at critiquing its own just-generated work. It creates a \"confirmation bias\" loop.  If one bot writes code, it assumes it works.  A dedicated testing bot's job is to be hostile and break the code as that is it's sole purpose.  By splitting the Builder from the Auditor, we simulate a code review process. One builds, the other tries to break it. A single agent simply nods at its own work.\n\n\n**Token Economics** - Loading a massive MEMORY.md and every tool definition for a simple \"Set a timer\" request is wasteful. Specialized agents allow us to route cheap tasks to fast models (Flash) and complex reasoning to heavy models (Opus/Pro), rather than burning expensive tokens for everything.\n\nIn short: A monolith is a \"Jack of all trades (master of none)\" The agentic framework is a team of specialists. You want to build for fidelity, not just functionality.",

I have done the equivalent in python and while this is rather easy to do, I was impressed that it did it with no oversight (other than to tell it that there were comments it missed so that it would fix the code).",

Define your exact filters (budget, neighborhoods, beds/baths, pet/parking, move-in window, must-haves).\n\n\n2. Monitor sources on a schedule (apartments.com, Zillow, Domu, HotPads, Craigslist, property manager sites, etc.).\n\n\n3. Normalize listings into one feed, dedupe, and score (price/value, commute, red flags).\n\n\n4. Alert you instantly (Telegram) only when a listing matches your rules.\n\n\n5. Add follow-up automations (open page snapshot, contact form draft, “save this one” queue).\nSuccess odds (realistic):\n\n• 85–95% chance we can build a reliable alerting pipeline for “new matching listings.”\n\n\n• 60–80% chance it catches listings fast enough to be genuinely useful in a hot market.\n\n• Lower if a site blocks automation heavily; we hedge by using multiple sources + fallback methods.\n\nIf you want, I can draft the exact monitoring spec in 10 minutes and we can launch a v1 today.",

For example, it browses our CRM/ERP systems to find projects that need invoices attached and sent to customers and then drafts the email and attaches invoices itself. It also provides around-the-clock email filtering, monitoring for false positives and alerting NOC to phishing campaigns. It runs in a controlled environment and does not stray out to the open web. It uses approved apps and websites with its own account which is logged. We're hoping to have it running 24/7 once we can ensure there will be no surprises.

      "text": "I'm a photographer. Solo operator. My technical expertise tops out at \"can make WordPress do what I want most of the time.\"\n\nI stumbled on OpenClaw and figured, worst case, I waste a weekend. Best case, I stop doing repetitive shit that makes me want to set fire to my laptop.\n\nIt's been a month. Here's the damage.\n\n**What we built (and I didn't write a single line of code)**\n\n*Lead generation that doesn't make me feel like a spammer*\n\n* 4-batch pipeline hitting Google every 6 hours\n* Finds businesses that actually need photography (not just randoms)\n* Drafts personalised outreach emails in Gmail\n* Waits for my approval before sending\n* 40-50 leads a day, zero manual searching\n\n*Instagram that manages itself*\n\n* Unfollows non-followers (but protects accounts with 1,500+ followers because I'm not a monster)\n* Hourly enrichment so we know actual follower counts\n* 25 unfollows per run, 6 times daily\n* Email reports so I can see what's happening without logging in\n\n*SEO monitoring*\n\n* Backlink opportunity scanner every 6 hours\n* Content gap analysis\n* GSC rank monitoring\n* Local citation tracking\n\n*The \"Initiative Engine\" (this one still blows my mind)*\n\n* Runs every 4 hours completely unsupervised\n* Reads my project files, spots improvement opportunities\n* Executes safe changes automatically\n* Asks permission before touching anything risky\n* Sends me a daily summary of what it did\n\n*Plus a bunch of smaller stuff*\n\n* Lightroom AI editing tools\n* Cron job logging dashboard\n* Google Drive backups\n* Memory system that actually remembers context between sessions\n* Moltbook engagement scripts\n\n**The setup cost**\n\nOpenClaw itself: free (open source)\n\nMy actual spend:\n\n* GLM5 via Nvidia NIM: \\~$20-30/month (this is the workhorse model)\n* Kimi for cheaper stuff: basically nothing\n* [Apollo.io](http://Apollo.io) for lead data: $0 (free tier, 85 credits/month)\n* Various APIs (Brave Search, etc.): negligible\n\nCall it $50/month to run a digital assistant that never sleeps.\n\n**The most important thing nobody told me: LLM hierarchy matters**\n\nHere's what I wish I'd known day one: **don't cheap out during setup.**\n\nWhen you're building the foundation (skills, cron jobs, system architecture), use Opus (Claude). Full stop. It's expensive but you'll save money overall because it gets complex multi-file changes right the first time. I tried using cheaper models for setup and ended up with broken scripts that took hours to debug.\n\nOnce everything's running, then you downgrade. My hierarchy now:\n\n* **Opus:** Initial builds, complex refactors, anything mission-critical\n* **GLM5:** Production cron jobs, routine tasks (runs 90% of the automation)\n* **Kimi:** Quick queries, simple edits, heartbeat checks\n\nDon't learn this the hard way like I did. Setup with Opus, optimize later.\n\n**Tips and tricks from the trenches**\n\n*Start with one thing that actually hurts*  \nDon't build automation for problems you don't have yet. I started with lead gen because manually finding prospects was making me miserable. That motivation matters when you're debugging at midnight.\n\n*Your agent needs a soul*  \nSounds wanky, but write a SOUL.md and USER.md. The more context about how you communicate and what you care about, the less time you spend correcting tone or explaining priorities. I put my \"no em-dashes ever\" rule in there and it's actually respected.\n\n*Drafts, not sends*  \nI could have my agent auto-send emails and DMs. I don't. Everything sits in drafts for my approval. Keeps me legally safe, reputationally safe, and honestly, I like knowing what's going out under my name.\n\n*Error logging from day one*  \nBuilt a cron logging system early. When something breaks at 3am (and it will), you want structured logs, not console output you forgot to capture. I get email alerts when jobs fail twice in a row.\n\n*Loop detection is non-negotiable*  \nOpenClaw can spiral if you're not careful. We built loop detection after one runaway session burned through 223k tokens chasing its own tail. Set limits. Trust but verify.\n\n*Heartbeat over cron for checks*  \nI use heartbeats for \"check email, calendar, status updates\" and actual cron jobs for \"do this specific thing at this specific time.\" Heartbeats batch work and reduce API calls. Cron is for precision.\n\n*The memory system is actually magic*  \nShort-term memory with 24h TTL, long-term SQLite storage, and semantic search. I can say \"what was that lead gen target I mentioned last week?\" and it finds it. Context persistence between sessions changes everything.\n\n**What actually changed**\n\nI used to spend 2-3 hours daily on outreach, Instagram cleanup, and checking various dashboards. Now that's maybe 15 minutes approving drafts and scanning reports.\n\nMore importantly, I'm not procrastinating on business development because \"ugh, I don't feel like scrolling through LinkedIn today.\" The machine doesn't have feelings. It just executes.\n\n**The catch**\n\nYou still have to know what you want. OpenClaw isn't magic; it's a really good implementer. If you give it vague instructions, you get vague results. The skill shift is from \"doing the work\" to \"describing what good looks like.\"\n\nAlso, you need to trust it enough to let it run unsupervised, which took me a week to get comfortable with.\n\n**Would I recommend it?**\n\nIf you're a solo operator drowning in admin work and you've got enough technical confidence to run commands in a terminal, absolutely. If you're expecting to say \"make me rich\" and have it happen, save your time.\n\nHappy to answer questions about any of the systems. Atlas wrote all the code; I just asked annoying questions until it worked.",

The key is correctly figuring out what they should do and precisely how, automate that, and put in the controls witih memory, subagent calling, detailed guidance so they can do next month's report exactly like this one, etc.\n\nEDIT: And I'm usually very open to criticism and people saying I'm doing something wrong, because I prefer to question myself and be questioned to make sure I'm doing it right. But tbh, the level of vitriol and kneejerk anger about using AI and Openclaw, especially in AI/Openclaw forums, is just getting really frustrating, and I'm at the point of \"hey, you know what, I just doubled my productivity in two weeks and my setup is blowing my mind every day with actual work improvements. I'm trying to share this with others so they can also benefit in the same way. I don't give a fuck if you agree with me or believe me, or think Openclaw is the Antichrist, or LLMs are just useless word salad producers. I'm not going to change your mind or even try anymore, I'm just going to keep doing my work.\"",

      "text": "the past two weeks i used openclaw in my b2b saas business. i run the business solo and am currently at $2k MRR with 97% profit margins.\n\nAs you can imagine i have a massive backlog of things to work on. So the premise of automating certain things was tempting.\n\nBesides doing marketing and building the product, I lost track of my new customers - how they are doing and where they need help. So naturally i decided to build a customer success agent to help me with this.\n\ninitially it was mindblowing. \n\nit created amazing reports for me. \nreports that would've taken a human hours, if not days. \n\nso naturally i started experimenting with it.\nexpanding its capabilities.\n\nand the first 3-4 days it went great.\n\nbut very soon i found myself spending more time on the agent than on the rest of my business.\n\nthings kept breaking. \nit straight up lied to me.\nwe went through dozens of restructures of its filesystem\ni rebuilt the entire bot from scratch\ni looked into ways to cut cost.\nand much more.\n\ntheres always something to do. \n\nso today, after two weeks, i pulled the plug. \n\nat least for now. \n\nultimately the time i spent on this was in no way proportional to the output i received. \n\nbut even besides that, it ultimately failed at automating communication with customers. \n\ntheres no way that at this stage i would let it do autonomous customer support on my saas. the amount of wrong information it wanted to sent out is staggering - even with proper documentation, access to codebase, database, stripe etc...something i can not afford to do in the type of business i'm in. \n\nskill issue some might say...\n\nand then there's the hunger for tokens. \nabsolutely blows my mind how inefficient it is. also when doing nothing. \n\neven when switching to a cheap model like gemini 2.5 flash for heartbeats you'll still end up paying $35/mo for just that.\n\nas a small business owner, my margins are the #1 thing I protect. \nand in 9 months of running this business, openclaw single handedly was the one thing that hurt my margins the most.\n\nso for now it has to go. \n\nwould love to hear from other business owners. how is your experience with it?",

          "text": "There are definitely some best practices when it comes to building openclaw systems that work.\n\n1. Build micro agents that do a small subset of tasks in their own workspaces, with their own models and their own memory, tools etc. This helps to avoid context pollution, and also helps conserve the context window for things that matter to the actual task.\n\n2. Don’t rely on the built in memory.md. It expands to the point where you’re just ballooning up your context window with irrelevant information, plus you will get drift and conflicting decisions and directives over time.\n\nInstead, I built a memory system that treats memory like the way a human does, long and short term memory. Short term memory is retained for 7 days, the stored in long term memory and rotated out through conf and removed. Long term memory is summarized, deduplicated, chunked, then the embeddings are stored in a vector database for retrieval. \n\n3. Don’t rely on heartbeats for automation. I use cronjobs and a deterministic layer of scripts for mechanical automation, then only use LLMs for valuable stuff like responding with natural language, or parsing text for high signal content. This ensures that your automation actually runs, and also avoids burning your tokens on things that don’t matter.\n\n4. The best way to write openclaw agents that work is to write them outside of openclaw. LLM automation is only as good as the feedback mechanisms you give it as you’re formulating the automation, and there are limits to the chat system interface. I use claude and codex simultaneously while building agents with what I call the pingpong strategy. I give them a guideline on what I want to accomplish, then I ask one of them to write a design document. They argue with each other about that document until they reach broad agreement, then I just review, correct if they’re off course, and let them write the software.",

Which gives you a path to fix it. However, those paths are long and arduous as you've found out.\n\nIf you've done any amount of software engineering on large projects to ship a product, you'll understand this gap between what a customer *expects* software to do and what it actually **can** do. The interesting thing about Openclaw is that it creates this pries open that gap into a vast chasm in people who should know better--- developers and business owners.\n\nHowever, those long arduous paths are obviously attainable with some straight-forward engineering. It still takes time. But that time is far far less than what it used to be.\n\nThat's the actual magic with Openclaw. It will get there eventually. But it's not there *yet*. So your choices are to *wait* until it gets there and *hope* that someone out there in the cloud *magically* fixes all your problems. Or you can roll up your sleeves and **get it done yourself**.\n\nIt's always been this way for software engineering. However, it's much much faster than before, though still painfully slow once you get used to the new normal of hyper-accelerated software development.\n\nWe're just at the first bendy part of the hockey stick of exponential growth and it still feels mighty slow to those of us zoomed into close to that part of the growth curve.",

I'm a copywriter by trade, but I run my own freelance business which includes invoicing, customer outreach, sales letters, cold calls, etc. So, when I saw OpenClaw could do some of that stuff, I was curious to take the plunge.\n\nI gave myself a budget of $200 for the first month and isolated OC to a cloud VPS. I also didn't connect it to any of my outside accounts, set strong security protocols, vibe-coded a memory system, and even began using Claude Opus 4.6. (Along with earlier versions of Haiku and Sonnet). At first it was great--and the guardrails helped. But after a few days I started noticing some weird behaviors.\n\nFirst, it became hyperbolic when I offered it a copy of my resume and asked it to help draft outreach letters for my clients. It flat-out embellished my accomplishments in these drafts, and it began to draw conclusions from these embellished accomplishments that weren't true. For example, I worked as a lead copywriter on a particularly large copywriting campaign for an international client, and OC misrepresented this work as \"leading content strategy for an international marketing department.\" Which is, by and large, quite a stretch.\n\nWhen I asked OC to help me build a safeword verification system for tier 2 and tier 3 tasks, it told me that doing so would take several hours. So, I authorized the work and came back about two hours later to check in after radio silence. At that time, the bot told me it had not only sat idle, but its reason for doing so was \"analysis paralysis.\" -- That's literally what it said.\n\nThen there is the cost. I've burned through half my budget in two weeks just to get up and running. I don't use any premade skills (because security issues) which means I've had to build out most of the baseline procedural scaffolding myself. As you can imagine, this burns through tokens like a junkie on a bender. Switching models, offloading heartbeats, and optimizing with online guides have helped, but I can still easily hit between $10-$30 in Claude API costs per day.\n\nThere have been other issues as well, but these are the ones that have been most prominent, and they are the ones that have relegated OpenClaw from competent full-time employee to stoned college intern. I can't use this for my business, and I don't trust it to help run my life. It's certainly a great start, and it's really fun to play with. But it's not ready for prime time unless you have a strong development background that can deal with the bugs.",

          "text": "You’d probably want a specialized chatbot rather than a general-purpose LLM. Those have existed for decades, and they’re quite good at what they’re designed to do.\n\nI agree this isn’t magic. There’s no single button that solves everything. But I definitely can see that the potential is real.\n\nOnce you can reliably distribute tasks to simpler, “dumber” models, you can strip the LLM out of that path and replace it with hard-coded pipelines. The result: fewer surprises, fewer breakages. And this isn't something you should do on your own, you should delegate it to someone else.\n\nThere was a recent YouTube clip showing a robot dog controlled by an LLM. It was instructed to shut itself off when a human pressed a button. About 50% of the time, it refused to turn the robot dog off.\n\nWhich is funny in a sci-fi way, and alarming in a “this is why you don’t give the intern root access” way.",

      "text": "Full tutorial for running OpenClaw offline via Ollama and Llama 3, Mistral, Mixtral. Zero API cost, full privacy, realistic hardware & config.\n\nWhy bother with local models?\n\nThe cloud APIs are convenient, but they leak three things:\n\nCost: At roughly $0.50 – $1.50 per million input tokens, background agents chewing through logs get expensive fast.\n\nLatency: 200 ms network hops feel okay for chat, painful for tight control-loop automations.\n\nPrivacy/compliance: Legal, health, and finance teams still veto sending customer data to third-party LLM providers.\n\nRunning locally solves all three. The trade-off: weaker models, more hardware tuning, and you babysit the stack yourself.\n\nLet's be real about what local models can and can't do\n\nLocal 7B models are not replacing GPT-4 or Claude. They're not even close. If you're expecting complex multi-step reasoning or long agentic workflows, you will be disappointed — and you should just use a cloud API for those tasks.\n\nWhere local models do work: simple, repetitive tasks that run on cron — log summaries, JSON parsing, basic message routing, calendar operations, structured data extraction. The kind of stuff where you're burning tokens on something that doesn't need frontier intelligence.\n\nThe smart move is a hybrid setup: run the simple stuff locally to save cost and keep data private, and route anything complex to a cloud model. OpenClaw lets you switch models per-tool in gateway.config.js, so you're not locked into one or the other.\n\nContext is also a real limitation. Don't crank num\\_ctx past 8192 on 7B models — quality degrades fast and VRAM spills to CPU. With bigger hardware (64GB+ RAM), Mixtral 8x7B can handle 16K context reasonably, but keep expectations grounded. If your use case needs deep context, that's another reason to route to a cloud model.\n\nHardware requirements and what actually matters\n\nRAM: 16 GB bare minimum for 7B parameter models. 32 GB gives headroom for OpenClaw, a browser, and Mongo. 64GB+ recommended if you want to run Mixtral or multiple agents.\n\nGPU (optional but huge win): Any 8 GB VRAM NVIDIA card halves latency versus CPU. 16GB VRAM gives you room for larger context windows and Mixtral offloading. FP16 works fine; you don't need tensor cores.\n\nDisk: 15 GB per quantized 7B model, 40 GB for 70B. Use SSD — Ollama memory-maps weights on load.\n\nCPU: 8 logical cores or more. Apple Silicon is excellent; Intel i5 11-series is okay.\n\nIf you're on a headless homelab server, add a swap file twice your RAM and you're less likely to OOM during first-run quantization\n\n\n\n# .Step 1 – Install Ollama (the local model runtime)\n\n# macOS\n\nHomebrew is the shortest path:\n\n`brew install ollama ollama serve &`\n\n# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)\n\nOllama ships a one-liner that adds the repo and installs a .deb:\n\n`curl -fsSL` [`https://ollama.com/install.sh`](https://ollama.com/install.sh) `| sh sudo systemctl enable --now ollama`\n\n# Windows 11 WSL2\n\nUse the Linux steps inside WSL2. GPU passthrough is still hit-or-miss; CPU works but is slower.\n\nAfter install, verify HTTP health:\n\n`curl` [`http://localhost:11434/api/tags`](http://localhost:11434/api/tags)\n\nYou should get an empty JSON list—no models yet, but the daemon is alive.\n\n# Step 2 – Download recommended models (Llama 3, Mistral, Mixtral)\n\nOllama’s naming is plain English. Pull the 8-bit quantized builds to keep RAM in check:\n\nRead Full article here: [openclaw-local-models-setup-run-completely-offline](https://www.clawcloud.dev/news/openclaw-local-models-setup-run-completely-offline-with)",

All of them have failed when it comes to doing anything beyond just a simple text response.\nI also run antigravity on my same machine and have had it try to test and configure openclaw with these local models. Everytime it can get basic text responses, but something with how openclaw works, causes any more advanced task to just silently fail. I don’t think it’s a failure of the models, just how they fundamentally work within openclaw.  \nWhy? I have yet to figure out. Hoping someone here may know. OP’s post just doesn’t even cover this, and it leaves me skeptical and wondering.\n  \nFor cost sensitivity, I want to use local. But due to the problems I’ve just fallen back to GPT-5-Nano, which is pennies and does what is likely a better job than what my local model could do anyways. Although I do hate the restrictions of OpenAI’s system prompts and security… which makes me want to still figure out the local model stuff, but they’re just breaking too often in open claw.",

Some users are figuring out a tiered model usage model where there is a hierarchy of requests with something like haiku, dealing with most general requests and escalation method per request the sum of which allows all requests to be routed to the appropriate model. It is obviously very expensive and very unnecessary to run every single request specially heartbeats and normal general conversation/cron jobs through anthropic, Opus 4.6\n\nAlso, people have been able to make that tokens efficient way way way more efficient I use maybe 20 to 40 K tokens per request and I have seen people get that down 1.5k per request. Although my last attempt to do this basically skeletonized open claw and took out most of the intelligence, I think my second attempt will be better. A lesson for me through the entire project has been that your first go at the job is probably going to be very difficult and even after you achieve it your actually just put yourself in a position to start over again way more educated way more informed and way more capable of doing whatever you want to do in the beginning. Thank you for that Peter. Also, this is true for both you and the agent. \n\nThat is an insane amount to work on. There is an insane amount to do even not being a developer of this program on the individual level it was never meant to be a full-fledged product. Peter now joining OpenAI is probably going to lead to this way more polished and usable model that about half of the current users actually want open claw is a great foundation and amazing things can be built from it, but it is not a full ledge product",

If it did something cool yesterday, it can’t always remember how to do it today. I’ve moved from native google to antigravity to openrouter, tried almost every model in existence, have learned about persistent memory and semantic search. So yeah, I’ve learned a ton. \n\nOne thing I’ve really saved money on though is using my Google AI pro sub via antigravity to do all the debugging and new implementations on Opus. It’s cheaper, and doesn’t screw up the system every time my agent tries to meddle with something she shouldn’t. 😂",

When your agent builds something trust it but verify it with your own research. There is a lot of friction in this. I spend most of my time on google researching and then passing that data to the agent. I've actually automated that process and it works a charm and speeds things up A LOT.

So that was a decent test of the telegram integration.\n\nThen, I asked it to do a simple task - watch a few stocks at mid-day and close of trading and if any move more than 5%, proactively send me a message on telegram.  This was my test of the cron scheduling.  But then something broke hard, I also ran out of OpenAI tokens and so messages started erroring out until I topped that up a bit, and now any time I send a message to my bot … it responds 2-3 times so now there’s some sort of weird concurrent context windows running … and I just donmt have the patience to go figure it out.  Interesting experiment, maybe some other time.  \n\nThen, I asked it to do something",

I get 2 emails a day with self-improvement options and recommendations and tell him which ones to implement.  The performance has really improved.  If you’re reading this Ralph - great job!!!
