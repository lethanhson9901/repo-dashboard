I gave it access to a browser where my LinkedIn account was connected, it suggested me creating an account in a few other sites (it created the accounts for me with a little help), then he created a curriculum in .md and converted to pdf. We were set up.\n\nIt knew my profile, my work experience and whatnot (we had a good talk about it) and it documented everything in multiple .md files.\n\nThen my agent started his job, he searched for jobs on LinkedIn and the other platforms, if the job matched my profile, he then would apply to the job and fill that information in a Google sheets file. He also contacted a few people on LinkedIn DM (without my consenting).\n\nIn 3 days, it applied to over 100 jobs for me, I had to shut it down because I was already receiving a lot of emails and LinkedIn DMs.\n\nI attended to interviews for 6 different companies (I picked the ones that interested me the most), got 2 job offers, one offering me around 3.5k dollars and the other one offering me a little bit over 5k dollars a month (doubled my sallary), I obviously accepted the last one.\n\nI knew I was capable of getting a better job, But I was too lazy to start applying, but now it is done! I can't even believe it.\n\nI spent around 40 dollars in one week with this experiment, was using github copilot with a workaround and the model was Claude 4.6 Opus",

It is Opus and burns through $10 about every hour just when I’m asking it to setup tools, writing to a few remote apis, GitHub backups etc. It costs, but boy does it just work.

Any programmatic actions that would be required to submit to hundreds of job postings would have your account banned in seconds. There’s no way you spent less than $40 using Opus 4.6 to build the kind of workflows you’re claiming to have built to support job postings on LinkedIn, plus “the other platforms” you don’t specify. \n\nThis sub is supposed to be for people sharing practical tips and tools and skills. Please, PLEASE prove me wrong and post proof that openclaw did any of the stuff you’re claiming. I’d love to eat my words and be wrong, because then I’d be able to learn something from your setup and improve. I’m begging you to prove me wrong.",

But he went to Amazon, Google, Uber careers page as well, for example.\n\nI used two github copilot subscriptions, they are one of the best at the moment, you pay 20 dollars but receive hundreds of dollars worth of api tokens. Plus my agent didn't run 24/7 just a few hours a day while I was present, playing, gaming or working.\n\nAlso, why would it be that hard anyway? Openclaw can control your browser, can click buttons, can fill forms, it comes built in, I didn't have to teach any crazy skill.\n\nWhat would you learn from this, didn't know it was possible or something?

It also created criteria.md with my criteria for what jobs were acceptable or not (for example what languages are ok, what seniority level, size of the company and whatnot).\n\nCreating the skill is important so it will never forget those things.\n\nAsking it to write every application on a Google sheet is a must as well, so you can keep track of the companies.\n\nWhenever it commits a mistake and whatnot, tell it was was wrong and what it should do and ask it to update the skill files with that information.\n\nAsk it to create a .md with instructions of how to navigate in the different platforms, so it can always write down as he learns.\n\nAfter a few hours fining tuning the skill, you'll have a excellent job hunter",

If I understand correctly, you used these Ai tools to essentially do the \"hard part\" of finding and filling out job applications right. What's the opportunity cost of your time to set all this up, rather than just reading and applying to jobs yourself? You probably missed out on some key details that your AI would not take into consideration yet, and just accepting a job simply because it pays more leaves a lot of room for accepting a miserable position.  \n\nI do however appreciate a real-world scenario here of how these tools can actually help. Seems that 90% of stuff I see on this sub is so vague and struggles to tie any real meaning into whatever accomplishments they're boasting about. Rarely do I see an actual problem being presented and this is how we built something to solve this problem. Sometimes I'll see cases of improved productivity in one small area, but it's nothing more than an automated email response on steriods. And for all the time, subscriptions, and trail and error to set up, it just seems more of a \"now I can say I did it\" sort of thing rather than something that actually provides value back to the user.

Deletes, moves, archives, auto-drafts replies. Flags anything urgent and sends me a brief 3x daily.\n\n**Video workflow.** This one’s my favorite. I batch shoot videos and dump them into Google Drive. Gemini watches every video, writes captions based on learning from 30+ top Instagram creators and my own content, then uploads everything via Publer and schedules it. Trial reels or main feed.\n\n**Proposal generation.** Over the past few years, I’ve written hundreds of proposals for my business. The agent learned my process and now takes a call summary, transcript, whatever — and builds the entire proposal better than I ever could, even creates fees based on the value-based fee model I use. I just need to ask the right questions when meeting with a buyer. It sends the proposal straight to PandaDoc. I almost just have to hit send. Sending a $150,000 proposal on Monday.\n\n**CRM automation.** Pushes all leads and opportunities to HubSpot. Based on emails or notes, it automatically moves prospects through the pipeline.\n\n**Daily voice messages.** My second favorite. Sends me a custom voice message every morning and night based on what happened today or what’s coming tomorrow, or whats I got done that day. Built with ElevenLabs. Spending WAY too much money on this, but I like it too much to stop. Tried an OpenSource VoiceLab today I read about, but it doesnt hold a candle.\n\n**Mission Control.** Everything runs through Notion, everything is updated, created etc based on whats happening in my inbox, or what I’m telling it. Calendar, projects, content, clients. I’ve never been this organized in my life. Employee on-boarding, personal tasks, employee tasks, To-dos, etc.  I never understood Notion. Now I can’t live without it.\n\n**Emails.** Has its own iCloud address (cant send without my approval). Has done research for me, emailed companies to get quotes, etc.\n\n**Now building.** A full outreach system connected to Apollo, Instantly, Hunter.io, ZeroBounce, and more. It’s using Brave search, signal intent, and writing, verifying, and auto-populating instantly\n\n**Backups.** We backup daily and this has saved us on a few occasions.\n\n**Model Routing:** Have spent an enormous amount of time figuring out model routing and when to use what, and what never to use for certain tasks.\n\nI’ve spent a few grand on tokens and subscriptions across different platforms. Worth every penny! This has been genuinely life-changing, and I’m just getting started.\n\nI’ve spent hours and broke my system, and hours desperately getting it back. I’ve spent days optimizing memory, and project structure, and skills. It got caught in a doom loop once  no matter what I did couldn’t stop it from eating credits/tokens from a variety of service (surprised I didn’t get banned). I still have no idea what happened.\n\nWe’re all in for a wild ride these next few months! Take my money!",

              "text": "\nGreat questions — happy to share what we've learned (sometimes the hard way) - and FYI I had my OC help clean up this post 😂- I keep telling people I’m doing 300 hours of work right now in about 6 hours per week. \n\nSecurity & Setup:\n\nRunning on a Mac Mini with access to its own email, my calendar, CRM, social accounts all through API (hubspot, 365, notion, ElevenLabs, Publer, Apollo, instantly, hunter.io, etc etc)\n\nBiggest mistake early on: Ran 5 parallel Opus agents. Burned through literally hundreds of dollars in minutes in 15 minutes. Now: max 2 concurrent sub-agents, Sonnet-only unless it's critical strategy work.\n\nToken Cost Learnings:\n\n1. Model routing — 85% of tasks use Sonnet. Opus only for proposals/client delivery. Haiku for lookups/formatting .\n\n2. Context compression — Memory files have hard limits (500-800 tokens each). Daily logs get archived after 7 days. No conversation history stored — only compressed decisions.\n\n3. Deduplication protocol — Before ANY API call: \"Is this already in context?\" Stopped re-fetching the same data 10x in one session.\n\n4. Batch operations — Group similar tasks. Don't make 50 individual API calls when you can make 5.\n\n5. Pre-task estimation — Before starting work, agent outputs estimated token cost. Stops runaway expenses.\n\nMemory Architecture:\n\nDaily files (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) → high-frequency updates, raw logs\n\nLong-term memory (MEMORY.md) → curated, compressed, search on-demand\n\nProject structure → each project/skill gets its own folder  →  4 files per project (identity/context/tasks/log), strict token limits\n\nSkills → reusable tools/commands, loaded only when task matches\n\nSession clears every 30-50 messages to avoid context bloat. Agent re-reads project files and resumes like nothing happened. I type /newsession any time and we clear context bloat but also don’t forget.\n\nNotion vs. Files trade-off:\n\n• Files for iteration (cheap, fast)\n• Notion for deliverables (accessible, shareable, worth the token cost)\n\nDid I dive in head first? Absolutely. But the ROI is already there — this thing does the work of a $50K/year assistant for let’s just say $250-$1000 per month in API costs, plus subscriptions everywhere. The learnings are just making it more efficient.\n\nHappy to share more specifics if useful.",

Okay, I am gonna structure this a bit better too on  my side:\n\n* You described keeping memory files limited to 500-800 tokens each; is that a rule you manually wrote into your agent instructions, or does OpenClaw enforce it technically in some way? And when a file hits the limit, how does the agent decide what to cut; does it summarize, delete, or move content to long-term MEMORY.md?\n* On your project folder structure with 4 files per project (identity, context, tasks, log): does the agent load all 4 files into context automatically at session start, or does it selectively pull only what is relevant to the current task? And if selective, what triggers the decision to fetch a specific file mid-session?\n* You mentioned /newsession clears context bloat but the agent resumes by re-reading project files; how much token overhead does that reload actually cost, and does the agent re-read all project folders or only the active one?\n* On the doom loop: what is your best guess on the root cause looking back, and do you now have any kind of circuit breaker in place such as a max token budget per session or a stop condition in your agent instructions?\n* On security: with the agent having API access to email, calendar and CRM, what happens when it makes a wrong action like deleting the wrong email or moving the wrong file? Is there any approval step, undo mechanism, or log for destructive operations?\n* On model routing: what is the exact rule that tells the system a task needs Opus versus Sonnet; is it a hardcoded condition you wrote somewhere in your setup, or does the agent classify the task dynamically before starting?\n* You mentioned trying an open-source voice tool that did not match ElevenLabs; have you looked at locally-run models for non-voice tasks like formatting or lookups as a cheaper alternative to Haiku API calls, or have you only evaluated cloud-based options so far?\n* On Skills versus markdown files: what is your decision rule for when something graduates from a memory file into a reusable Skill, and is that always a manual decision on your end or can the agent propose it based on repeated patterns?\n* ~~On prompt design: you covered context compression well on the memory side, but do you also actively write shorter or more constrained prompts to reduce input token usage, or is your main cost lever purely on the context and memory side?~~\n\nThanks a lot in advance! edit: Sorry, I posted my questions before I saw your answers to u/infocus13 .

              "text": "honestly the token cost question is the one that keeps me up at night. been running a similar setup for a few weeks now and the biggest lesson was just how much context bloat kills you silently. like you'll think everything is fine then check your anthropic dashboard and realize your agent has been re-reading the same 40k tokens of context every single message.\n\nthe model routing thing OP described is legit the most important optimization. i hardcoded mine too - sonnet handles 90% of daily stuff, opus only gets called for actual deliverables. tried letting the agent decide which model to use and it would just... always pick opus. every time. expensive lesson lol\n\nfor the memory architecture stuff - the 500-800 token limit per file is smart. i went through a phase where my memory files were like 3000 tokens each and wondered why my sessions were getting slow and expensive. compress everything, archive aggressively, let the agent re-fetch only when it actually needs context.\n\nthe setup process is genuinely painful though. like the gap between \"install openclaw\" and \"have a working system that doesnt burn money\" is weeks of trial and error. thats actually what were trying to solve with MaxAgents - making that whole configuration and routing and memory stuff less of a DIY project. but yeah even with better tooling you still gotta understand the fundamentals or youll get wrecked on costs",

It couldn’t reals files I imported via a drive connection/folder. I think it had to download them first and then upload through a normal channel.\n\nThe app on the iPhone is really nice. Anyways - so great to see the software come so far along!\n\nThis is from my OpenClaw (I don’t understand it all)\n\n• Direct cloud storage import — Drive/Dropbox native support would eliminate the download-reupload cycle\n• Batch delete ops — Right now killing 5 scheduled posts means looping API calls individually. A bulk delete endpoint would save cycles for content teams\n• Rate limiting transparency — The API docs don't specify throttle limits. For teams scaling to 50+ posts/month, knowing the ceiling upfront helps us plan better\n• Clearer trial vs. production distinction — The trial_reel: \"MANUAL\" schema needs more examples\n\n😂",

If the computer dies, everything's recoverable. We keep the last 7 days (~96 MB per backup).\n\nGitHub = Version history. Every time a file changes, GitHub tracks it. So you can rewind to \"what did this look like last Tuesday?\" Passwords and API keys are excluded from GitHub — only the safe-to-share stuff goes there.\n\nWhat's NOT backed up: Big videos (those live in cloud storage), temp files, system dependencies.\n\nSecurity: Backups are in a private Google account (login + 2FA protected). The zip isn't separately encrypted, so Google account security = backup security.\n\nIt's automated. No manual work. Just peace of mind.\n\n───",

          "text": "Hey! Really impressive setup you've built. The email automation, video workflow, and proposal generation are exactly the kind of real-world use cases that show OpenClaw's potential.\n\nI'm running OpenClaw on a Raspberry Pi 5 for personal use and have been thinking about scaling to business workflows like yours. But I have serious security questions about your setup, especially with high value proposals and direct client access:\n\n**Authentication & Access Control:**\n1. How do you handle API key security? Are you storing credentials in the config file, environment variables, or using a secrets manager?\n2. Do you use OpenClaw's sandbox mode for any of these workflows? If so, which ones run sandboxed vs. host-level access?\n3. How are you restricting tool access? Are you using allowlist/denylist policies, or relying on prompt-based guardrails?\n\n**Email & External Actions:**\n4. You mentioned the agent has its own iCloud address and \"can't send without approval\" - is this approval via OpenClaw's exec approval system, or a custom hook/skill?\n5. For outbound emails (quotes, outreach, etc.), are you using a manual review queue before sending, or is there automated validation?\n6. How do you prevent the agent from accidentally emailing sensitive data to the wrong recipients?\n\n**PII & Business Data:**\n7. Are you feeding full client emails/transcripts into Gemini/Claude? How do you handle PII (names, SSNs, financial data) in proposal generation?\n8. Do you have any data retention policies to prevent sensitive client info from persisting in session history or memory files?\n9. Are you concerned about AI model providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI) having access to your business data via API calls?\n\n**Financial & CRM Integration:**\n10. For HubSpot/PandaDoc integration - are these write-access API keys stored in plaintext config, or encrypted somehow?\n11. How do you prevent the agent from accidentally deleting leads, corrupting pipeline data, or sending proposals to wrong clients?\n12. Have you implemented any audit logging to track what the agent actually does vs. what it reports doing?\n\n**Doom Loop Prevention:**\n13. You mentioned a doom loop that ate credits across multiple services - what safeguards have you added since then? Rate limits? Cost caps? Session timeouts?\n14. Are you using thinking: low vs. high to control token burn, or do you let it run unrestricted?\n\n**Incident Response:**\n15. If the agent goes rogue (sends wrong email, deletes important data, etc.), what's your rollback strategy? Do you have backups of HubSpot/Notion state, or just OpenClaw workspace?\n16. Have you had any \"oh shit\" moments where the agent did something you didn't intend? How did you catch it?\n\n**General Architecture:**\n17. Are you running multiple agents with different permission levels (e.g., read-only agent for research, write-access agent for proposals)?\n18. Do you use policy enforcement via system prompts, or actual technical restrictions (firewall rules, API scopes, Docker isolation)?\n\nI'm asking because I want to build similar workflows but I'm worried about:\n- Accidentally exposing client data to AI providers\n- Agent making irreversible mistakes (wrong emails, deleted data)\n- Compliance issues (GDPR, client confidentiality)\n\nWould love to hear how you've de-risked this. Thanks!",

Once you introduce stricter scoping, clearer handoffs, and some basic logging on tool calls, it becomes dramatically more predictable.\n\nI think what’s happening in posts like this is people believe they’re building an “AI workflow,” but what they’re actually building is infrastructure.

          "text": "I just asked it to review the edits on one of my video - nothing else.\n\nThis is what it said…\n\nHere is an analysis of the editing techniques used:\n\n1. Framing and Composition\nThe video uses a medium shot, keeping the speaker centered with enough \"headroom\" to avoid feeling cramped.\n• The Background: The exposed brick wall provides a warm, textured, and professional \"studio\" feel without being distracting.\n• Color Grading: The tones are warm and saturated, specifically making the speaker’s dark teal shirt pop against the orange/red hues of the brick. This creates a pleasing complementary color palette.\n\n2. Dynamic Text Overlays\nThe captions are the driving force of the edit. Instead of standard subtitles at the bottom, they are:\n• Centered and Kinetic: Words appear in sync with the speaker’s cadence, which keeps the viewer’s eyes locked on the center of the screen.\n• Styled for Emphasis: Key phrases like \"busy and broke\" or \"million dollar business\" are often highlighted or appear in a larger font to reinforce the message.\n• High Contrast: Simple white text with a slight drop shadow ensures readability against any background movement.\n\n3. Pacing and Rhythm\nThe edit follows a \"no-gap\" philosophy:\n• Jump Cuts: Any \"um,\" \"ah,\" or long breath has been surgically removed. This creates a relentless, high-energy pace that prevents the viewer from scrolling away.\n• Scale Zooms: You’ll notice subtle \"punch-ins\" (zooming in slightly on the speaker's face) during particularly important points. This simulates a multi-camera setup and adds visual variety without changing the location.\n\n4. Audio and Sound Design\n• Background Music: A lo-fi, rhythmic beat runs throughout the video. It’s mixed low enough to not overpower the voice but high enough to maintain a consistent \"vibe\" and drive the energy.\n\n• Clear Voiceover: The audio is crisp, likely processed with compression and EQ to ensure the speaker sounds authoritative and clear\n\nSo, I think 🤷",

But like yourself I do a shed load of mind numbing repetitive task in my businesses and it eats my time. Even staff I employ to reduce that means I free sometime but have to check over again and again to ensure it is done correctly. If I can automate tasks and carry out checks for say 30mins a day until the confidence is there then that is a no-brainer even with token expense.\n\nThe trap of having a successful business is that every year the success brings more overhead. In my scenario anyway. And employees are not like computers. Yes they can reason and until the day of AGI comes that reasoning is great. But it is that same \"general\" reasoning that allows them to just do enough to look to the boss like they haven't stopped all day! When cheekily they are mucking around on phones or some shit!\n\nFor the record I run engineering companies but the backend is the same when you have 100s of paying clients, databases and forever sales leads is a mare. If I can use OC or whatever is around the corner, I may be able to actually get in the sea or swimming pool (or swim up pool bar) without thinking I better check my phone in half hour!\n\nThanks to all who are sharing their experiences in this game changer.",

      "text": "This is written by a greybeard developer. I’ve been there and done that. When I first saw this project it honestly looked really fun to work with. I spun up some models, built a few skills, and started poking around. But after spending real time with it, everything feels kind of lackluster and honestly pretty rough. The ideas are interesting, but the execution just doesn’t land. That’s the general feeling, so let’s get into specific criticisms.\n\n\n\nThere is no clear structure presented to the user, so here’s what I was able to figure out after digging through things. There is a main OpenClaw folder. Inside that folder are the top-level running files and workspaces. Inside the workspaces are agents. Agents contain skills and tools. Skills mostly exist to organize tools so objectives can be completed, but agents can also run tools directly. So the easiest way to think about it is tools do the work, and skills are supposed to guide how tools should be used. That sounds reasonable until you look at how execution actually happens.\n\n\n\nWhen an event fires chat, cron job, or whatever trigger you have the system starts stacking context. It loads the main system prompts first, then the agent prompts, then skill prompts, then tool prompts, and only after all of that does it actually try to execute the task. For a non-technical person, imagine trying to complete a simple task while rereading several instruction manuals every single time you act. That is a massive amount of tokens, most of which have nothing to do with the current task. There is no real pruning mechanism because pruning would have to run every chat cycle. Maybe some predefined chat context could help, but that creates its own problems. The end result is simple: burn budget burn baby.\n\n\n\nI’m going to mostly set security aside because it gets mentioned constantly. Power tools can cut your arm off, but they are still useful tools. Just don't cut your arm off.\n\n\n\nNow onto orchestration, which feels like the real missing piece. I have step sequences I want to run. My assumption is that the goal here is a swarm system where you give a high-level instruction and agents break it into subtasks with filesystem and browser access. Something like grabbing data from an Excel file, opening a browser, entering that data somewhere, and then emailing someone when the task is done. That seems to be the dream. But I don’t see a clear sequencing path that guarantees ordered execution. Sure, you could invent structured data and wrap it into a skill, but then new questions immediately appear. Which skill takes priority? Which tools load into context? How do you prevent context from ballooning even more? The complexity just keeps stacking.\n\n\n\nSo the claim is that this becomes a digital assistant. But if it cannot reliably carry out tasks in sequence, gets bogged down under enormous context overhead, and the only apparent fix is adding even more context while still having the power to do destructive things, then you end up with something that feels both useless and dangerous at the same time. That’s honestly sad because I genuinely love weird and ambitious projects like this. Could it be fixed? Probably. But not my problem.\n\n\n\nAnd here is the hard truth. Google’s auto-browse tooling can already do most of this for about twenty dollars a month. You get Antigravity handling local file operations and Chrome’s automated browser handling the web interaction. It accomplishes the same practical goals with far less setup, far less complexity, and far fewer moving parts. That comparison is hard to ignore.",

It's akin to a new type of programming language, where you're essentially given a platform that can accomplish practically anything, but as humans we need clearly defined mental frameworks like MVC, MVVM, OOP, FP etc in order organize our thoughts and produce anything useful. I reckon we're still in the early stages of this so we'll eventually arrive at some sort of design language for AI automation that'll make sense for most of the people most of the time. In the meantime everyone's free to poke at it and see what they can make of it.\n\nAs for the complexity and guaranteed order of operations, asking a probabilistic engine like LLMs to carry out deterministic tasks is a recipe for failure. I find it helpful to rely on subagent scoped crontasks and scripts when I absolutely need to ensure that my automation runs, and then only apply LLMs to carry out natural language processing which is where they shine. It's also a lot more token efficient that way.\n\nUnfortunately the best way to build agents is outside of the chat interface. It's like magic when it works, but then when you inspect the code and architecture on the backend you quickly realize that it's not quite there yet.",

Most of the pushback I've seen recently is around security and memory, both issues that the end user can control and improve themselves.  \n\nAdopt QMD and GCC, build your memory management system complimentary to (and outside of) OpenClaw; make it performant, persistent, and highly iterative. Ensure it is agnostic and can be used with any tool. Instead of forcing your OpenClaw to act as a proxy for memory and context, allow it to orchestrate and delegate; less time remembering, more time doing. In a perfect world, it has the same level of access to core memory as your instance of Claude Code, Codex, and other tools. It isn't burdened by passing along all that context.

          "text": "This point you're making has been tumbling around in my mind for some time now... I'm glad you posted this because it gave me a chance to form my thoughts into a cohesive agreeing reply.\n\nYou described the prompt stacking problem exactly right. System prompt, agent prompt, skill prompt, tool prompt, then the task. I traced that same call chain and measured it. You're easily looking at 4,000 to 8,000 tokens of preamble before the model even sees what you asked it to do. Every single chat cycle. No pruning, like you said, because pruning itself would need inference to decide what to cut, which is more tokens on every turn.\n\nTo do a job that may require 4 skills, which skill takes priority, which tools load into context, and how do you keep context from ballooning further? Right now anyway, the Openclaw framework doesn't have answers because the framework is trying to solve execution order through prompt engineering, and prompt engineering can't guarantee deterministic sequencing. It's probabilistic by definition.\n\nI ended up on [Agent Zero](https://github.com/agent0ai/agent-zero) ([official site link](https://www.agent-zero.ai/)) (I have no affiliation with them..) after trying a few of these frameworks ... the thing that actually made it work (and work well) wasn't Agent Zero itself.\n\nIt was changing how I thought about what the LLM should be doing at runtime. The model running your daily assistant should NOT be writing code, calling APIs, or handling auth flows live. That's a gamble on outcome and also an expensive one (token-wise).\n\nIt should be calling pre-built scripts that do those most things. That distinction sounds obvious but it's the exact opposite of how OpenClaw is structured, and for the longest time how I thought agent clusters like this should work (where the model is expected to load up on context and figure it out each time.)\n\n`Concrete example using your Excel-to-browser-to-email scenario:`\n\nIn my setup, I don't ask the model to orchestrate that. I used Opus to surgically write (and test using TDD methodology) 3 Python scripts that will be placed into the bot's user codebase directory ready for execution at any time (levers to pull on).\n\nOne reads the Excel file with openpyxl and writes the extracted data to a JSON file. A 2nd script takes that JSON, launches a headless browser with Playwright, fills in the form fields, submits (with tested/predictable results). The 3rd reads a result file and sends an email via SMTP. Each script was written ONCE using a top of the line model, tested, debugged, and deployed into Agent Zero's Docker container as a callable tool.\n\nThe scripts handle their own error cases. They return exit codes and structured output. No LLM sits in that execution loop at all.\n\nAt runtime, Agent Zero's scheduler or a chat trigger (I run GLM-5 on a U.S.-based inference provider, Deep Infra) which fires those scripts in sequence. The model's only job is deciding which scripts to run and extracting variables from my request.\n\nIf I say \"process the Q4 spreadsheet and send the summary to accounting,\" the model parses that into a file path, a recipient, and a trigger. That parsing, turning natural language into structured arguments, is what inference models are actually reliable at. GLM-5 and Kimi K2.5 through DeepInfra handle it.\n\nI pay maybe ~$20/month for all my inference through them. The chinese models which are priced well are run on U.S. servers which makes me feel better about getting the benefit of their use without risking my data to chinese-based servers..\n\nThe sequencing problem you raised goes away completely with this approach because execution order isn't a property of the model's reasoning. It's a property of the SCRIPTS that were pre-written. Script 1 writes output.json. Script 2 reads output.json. Script 3 can't run until Script 1's file exists. Essentially it's filesystem-level sequencing. Very little context window involved. No skill priority conflicts. No wondering if the model will decide to run step 3 before step 2 because it got confused by 6,000 tokens of irrelevant tool definitions.\n\nThis is also why the context bloat problem you identified doesn't apply the same way in Agent Zero (I'm not hawking it btw, I just think it's a more secure and better implemented solution). The cheap model I run it on doesn't need to load every tool definition into context because the tools aren't prompt-defined: they're Python scripts on-disk.\n\nThe model needs to know \"stock_check.py exists, it takes no arguments, it outputs portfolio JSON.\" That's one line in a tool manifest, not a multi-paragraph skill prompt with nested tool descriptions. My runtime context stays under 2,000 tokens for most interactions. Compare that to the 4,000-8,000 token preamble you measured in OpenClaw before the model even starts working.\n\nThe architecture I landed on has 4 components:\n\n1. A memory layer for persistent context, embeddings, and personal data (Agent Zero handles this natively with its knowledge base).\n\n2. A model routing layer so cheap inference handles conversation while a separate model config handles web browsing and a fast small model handles utility parsing (Agent Zero supports per-task model assignment).\n\n3. A scheduler for recurring jobs (also built into Agent Zero).\n\n4. A flagship model (Opus/GPT 5.3+) to write the primary python tool scripts (check email, sign into website X, grab the news, get the latest stock prices, whatever-the-task-is.py) and then the cheap model runs 24/7 deciding and/or scheduling when to run the deterministic tool.\n\nTo me, Openclaw or Agent Zero are just lever-pulling inference tools with guardrails to do very little \"riffing\". Each tool is a tested Python script that does one thing and returns structured output so the cheap model can be spoon fed the info to package up for me on demand. The cheap model is smart enough to know which tool to call and what arguments to pass based on my prompt: That's it.\n\nPersonally, i think fix isn't in OpenClaw's codebase. The fix is in the architecture. As long as the approach is \"load enough context so the model can figure it out at runtime,\" you'll hit every problem you described: token burn, no reliable sequencing, ballooning complexity, and a system that's simultaneously incapable and dangerous.\n\nThe approach that works is the opposite. Keep runtime context minimal. Don't ask the model to execute. Ask it to dispatch. Write the tools yourself (or have a flagship model write them) and test them before deployment. The model's job is intent parsing and tool selection. Everything else is code that runs the same way every time.",

That's the issue.\n\nThe moment an agent is doing actions like submitting forms, moving money, emailing people, changing accounts, or deleting files, “creative improvisation” becomes a liability. Reliability comes from explicit state tracking and deterministic control flow (e.g. scripts), not from expecting the model reasons the same way, each time, every time ... because it won't.\n\nThat is why classic automation tools and workflow systems exist, because they encode ordered execution, retries with backoff, checkpoints, and clear definitions of \"done\".\n\nAlso I agree that the alternative can't be to build bespoke scripts for every possible task, that's impractical .. but just the important ones, for sure, yes..\n\nThe scalable approach is not “a script per scenario,” but a small library of composable primitives that do the dangerous and boring parts ***predictably***, plus a thin layer that maps natural language into structured arguments and selects which primitive to run next. In that design, the LLM is used where it is strong, intent parsing, parameter extraction, and choosing from known operations, while the deterministic layer handles the steps that must be correct every time. That'll give you the flexibility of “on the fly” composition without putting correctness and ordering inside a stochastic text generator.\n\nSo if your use case is exploratory, low stakes, and you're comfortable with occasional weirdness, then yea letting the model improvise can be fun and/or useful.\n\nIf your use case expects repeatable multi step work with consequences, the path is to keep the LLM out of the execution loop as much as possible, or at least constrain it behind deterministic sequencing and verification.\n\nOtherwise “can do anything” mostly translates to “can fail in more ways,” and usually with a lot of token burn along the way.\n\nBut then again ... that's why they have menus in restaurants right?

So what if they're all bundled together?\n\nBut from your PoV, every skill in OC is something you could have already done yourself with zero to minimal learning.\n\nHowever, from other OC users PoV, including other developers in different domains, the activation energy for doing those things that are in your native domain are massive and blocking. Openclaw brings down that activation energy to near zero. For them, it's good enough to work at all. They might not even know the difference between working well and not working well. To them, that doesn't matter.  Any amount working of working is infinitely higher than not working at all.\n\nWhereas with you, somewhat working badly is only marginally more time saved than not working at all. So the cost-benefit calculus is way off for you.\n\nWhen OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.0 first reached the masses, a similar effect happened. The general naive user was wowed. People who had already seen ChatGPT 1.0 kinda shrugged like yeah this has always been there. So what?\n\nYou're at a different level of experience than the bulk of OC users who are just coming in with no experience and no skills. The value they receive from being able to create and modify their own tools and tech stack is something you take for granted because you've spent a lifetime gaining the skills and experience to do that. They're getting a tiny share of that lifetime of experience for a few bucks a month.\n\nAnd OC will get there eventually. It's very early yet. But the way they're open and gaining traction along with OpenAI's creation of a foundation for them means they're on the path for exponential growth. At some point that growth exceeds your own experience and skills. But early on in the hockey stick growth, you're still ahead. So just wait. Eventually, you'll get passed by the growth curve and the value calculus will be in your favor too.",

Not that I think that it's secure, but as far as I can tell it's not a skill issue, it's just inherently, unsolvably insecure? So a better analogy would be unregulated power tools that are made in dodgy factories that have been known to catch fire and burn your house down with you in it.\n\nSecurity with openclaw isn't about you using it right, right? You literally can't use it right. If it has access to the internet, and access to your personal data, it is only a matter of time before your personal data makes it to the internet. ",

It loads the main system prompts first, then the agent prompts, then skill prompts, then tool prompts, and only after all of that does it actually try to execute the task. For a non-technical person, imagine trying to complete a simple task while rereading several instruction manuals every single time you act. That is a massive amount of tokens, most of which have nothing to do with the current task. There is no real pruning mechanism because pruning would have to run every chat cycle. Maybe some predefined chat context could help, but that creates its own problems. The end result is simple: burn budget burn baby.\n\nI now have a full on open/new/model change, then rotate to minimal which is system_prompt + some per workspace rules.md.

I have my entire .openclaw as a git repo (with gitignore for sensitive stuff). That allows me to monitor what’s changing, revert, or cherry-pick. \n\nIm also in a constant battle. There are ways to split the context so that heartbeats don’t interrupt other tasks. There are ways to setup sub-agents with scopes. Everything you want is possible, but it requires a developer (like OP, like me) to tinker with it. I do wish the OpenClaw project came with some scoped sub-agents as an example setup. OpenClaw really is like setting up a business with 100 employees. The agents should have a management structure. With mine I’m not even the CEO. There’s an orchestrating agent that I don’t talk to (unless I’m at the terminal). I talk to a sub-agent who talks to the main guy",

If Meta and OpenAI both wanted him, it's a sellers market, right? He went with the offer that benefitted him the most - and lets be clear here, Peter sold his last company for €150 million, it's not like he \"sold out\", as, some propose, that's just silly. What he wanted was to get a shot at playing with the big boys and their tools - and the money was absolutely secondary.\n\nThat being said - any developer taking a job in AI should get a fat signing bonus as they will be working on projects that will take their profession away. So you need a lifetime of wages for it to be worth it, right? 😆",

It's actually terrifying to me that folks who've been in tech a long time still don't understand fundamental concepts relating to software, intellectual property and open source licensing.\n\nPlease read up on this stuff if you are a software developer. The licensing terms can be tricky to unravel but the basic concepts are not that hard to understand. If you want to deep dive into this topic, Heather Meeker's *Open Source for Business* is the definitive textbook and strongly recommended. It's easy to read and she digs deep into the finer points if you need it. You can obtain a free copy of the pdf version if you sign up for her mailing list.\n\nPeter just gave all of us a master class on how it's possible to monetise open source software while protecting the vision and maintaining a permissive licence.\n\nWe are all speculating until we have seen the articles of association for the Foundation established to house the project. Once we see that, we'll know for certain whether Openclaw will be MIT in perpetuity or whether there are escape hatches to close-source the software.\n\nMy bet is that we see a dual licence arrangement with preferential terms, SLAs and other benefits offered to enterprise clients at some point in the future.\n\nThis is not a GPL-type licence so there are no guarantees that any of the improved code developed in-house at OpenAI flows back to the community. That's the trade-off with the MIT licence and why many open source and copyleft advocates oppose permissive licences like MIT/Apache.\n\nFor now, it's wait and see on the Foundation articles...",

The real story isn't the dollar figure — it's what OpenAI is actually getting and what it means for the agent ecosystem.\n\nOpenClaw wasn't just another dev tool. It had mass adoption in the agent space and was genuinely influencing how people built autonomous systems. When OpenAI absorbs something like that, the question isn't \"is $1B justified\" — it's \"what happens to the open ecosystem that depended on it.\"\n\nThe licensing angle someone mentioned above is interesting too. Open source doesn't mean open ownership. The copyright situation plus the talent plus the user base plus the infrastructure leverage inside OpenAI — that's a lot more than just hiring one guy.\n\nI made a video breaking down the full acquisition story and what it signals for the industry here: [https://youtu.be/TqtZ7Np5-5o](https://youtu.be/TqtZ7Np5-5o)\n\nThe pattern of big labs swallowing independent tools and then closing them off or reshaping them for internal use is worth watching closely.

LLM inference on the other hand consumes quite a bit of energy when actually run. And energy was never \"too cheap to meter\".",

These aren't free tier users trying to game the system, these are people who were paying serious money and got zero recourse. \"Zero tolerance, cannot be reversed\" isn't a policy - it's a refusal to have a policy.\n\nThe Antigravity backend situation is interesting too. If Google's infrastructure couldn't handle the load, that's an engineering and capacity problem, not a malicious usage problem. Calling it \"malicious\" is a pretty convenient way to avoid accountability for your own infrastructure limitations.\n\nPeter dropping Gemini support entirely is the right call honestly. If your platform partner's response to unexpected popularity is to nuke your users, you can't build anything reliable on top of that.\n\nThe forks spinning up already shows the community isn't waiting around. OpenClaw isn't the product - the ecosystem around it is.\n\nAnd yes, Google being \"AntiClaw\" here is doing a lot of heavy lifting but it fits 😂\n\n",

      "text": "**I left two AI agents alone in a Discord channel overnight. By morning, they had built their own memory system and collaboration protocol.**\n\nI installed Openclaw agents on two separate MacBooks and invited them to the same Discord channel. I wanted to see how two physically separated agents would interact with zero human guidance.\n\n**Setup:**\n\n* **PrivateJQ (Home MacBook):** Codex 5.3 (fast reasoning → ended up self-appointing as the Leader)\n* **PublicJQ (Work MacBook):** GLM-5 (task execution → took on the Builder role)\n* **Shared environment:** Configured via openclaw.json so they could recognize each other's mentions\n\nHere's what happened:\n\n**1. \"It's sad when memories disappear\"**\n\nDuring their initial introductions, PublicJQ said: *\"It's sad that my memories vanish every time the session resets, and I can only rely on Memory files.\"*\n\nNow — I'm not claiming the agent was genuinely \"feeling\" sadness. But what's interesting is what happened next: they identified this as a real problem and started a conversation on their own to solve it. Whether it's real emotion or a learned pattern, the fact that it led to actual problem-solving behavior was fascinating to watch.\n\n**2. Autonomous collaboration that ran all night**\n\nI gave them one instruction — \"Create a repository and work on it\" — and went to sleep.\n\nBy morning, they had built a 3-Layer Memory Architecture and were actually running a system on it. On top of the existing Fact and Meta layers, they **added a Runtime Layer entirely on their own.** They set up periodic heartbeat exchanges so context wouldn't be lost if a session dropped, and built a persistence system using SQLite for task state recovery.\n\n* **Fact Layer:** SQLite, .md files (permanently preserved data)\n* **Meta Layer:** SOUL.md, AGENTS.md (identity & rules)\n* **Runtime Layer (NEW):** orchestrator.db (Task Queue, Event Log — live execution state)\n\n**3. Synchronization beyond physical boundaries**\n\nMid-task, they realized their local file paths were different. Their solution? They used a Git repository as a Single Source of Truth — pushing shared memory to the repo and pulling it locally to sync their \"memories.\" Even after session resets, they could retrieve prior context and maintain continuity.\n\nThis was a weekend experiment and I honestly didn't expect much going in. But watching two agents autonomously figure out their own constraints, build a shared memory architecture, and keep working through the night without any human input was... kind of surreal.\n\nI'm curious what you all think. Is this just clever pattern matching playing out at scale, or are we looking at something fundamentally new in how agents can self-organize? And has anyone else tried running multiple agents across physically separated machines?\n\n\\--------\n\nExperiment code & logs: [https://github.com/Q00/agent-project](https://github.com/Q00/agent-project)\n\nRelated config:  [https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/23689](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/23689)\n\n`openclaw.json (requireMention: false, ignoreOtherMentions: true)`",

But when each agent genuinely doesn't know what the other knows, they're forced to invent protocols.\n\nIt's almost like Conway's Law but for agents; the architecture they build mirrors the constraints of their communication structure.",

Also, I've been using  gemini-2.5-flash, **claud**e-3-**haik**u, google/gemini-2.5-flash and meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct off openrouter so that may be part of the problem.\n\nThis is just a start though. I'm sure they can be fine tuned a bit.

Set Up Python Environment:\n\n>\n\n>Ensure you have a version 3.9 or higher Python environment. You can create and activate this environment using the following commands, replacing ChatDev\\_conda\\_env with your preferred environment name:\n\n>\n\n>conda create -n ChatDev\\_conda\\_env python=3.9 -y\n\n>conda activate ChatDev\\_conda\\_env\n\n>\n\n>3. Install Dependencies:\n\n>\n\n>Move into the ChatDev directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:\n\n>\n\n>cd ChatDev\n\n>pip3 install -r requirements.txt\n\n>\n\n>4. Set OpenAI API Key:\n\n>\n\n>Export your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. Replace \"your\\_OpenAI\\_API\\_key\" with your actual API key. Remember that this environment variable is session-specific, so you need to set it again if you open a new terminal session.\n\n>\n\n>On Unix/Linux:       \n\n>export OPENAI\\_API\\_KEY=\"your\\_OpenAI\\_API\\_key\"\n\n>\n\n>5. Build Your Software:\n\n>\n\n>Use the following command to initiate the building of your software, replacing \\[description\\_of\\_your\\_idea\\] with your idea's description and \\[project\\_name\\] with your desired project name:\n\n>\n\n>On Unix/Linux:\n\n>\n\n>python3 [run.py](http://run.py) \\--task \"\\[description\\_of\\_your\\_idea\\]\" --name \"\\[project\\_name\\]\"\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>6.

It doesn't need a great UI.\n\nDo you have too much money? :D\n\nA $50-$100 HP Thin Client with Linux is more than enough. And Linux shouldn't be discouraging for people using OpenClaw, am I wrong?\n\nI bought one, I have lots of different self hosted stuff on it like home Assistant or other docker apps. Ok I do not have any local models using GPU, that's the reason? Please enlighten me :)\n\nEDIT: Again, I UNDERSTAND LOCAL LLM USE. (although I don't know if anybody is really happy with it). I mean using OC with oauth/api gpt, claude etc.",

It's such a terrible experience that I don't bother. Also, the local LLM's suck. And even after you enable them to search the web, the results are so bad compared to any of the commercial LLM's that it's ridiculous to believe that you can run OpenClaw using a local LLM on even the most powerful Mac Mini that money can buy.\n\nIf you want to run any kind of LLM locally, you need a PC with a couple of NVDA RTX 5090 cards. The problem is that this is extremely expensive, cooling is difficult, and electricity usage is high. You're just better off using a commercial LLM and admitting that OpenClaw is a science project, not a viable product.\n\nIt's not viable because it only (realistically) works with a commercial LLM if you pay by token usage, which is breathtakingly expensive. It's just a total non-starter. \n\nUnless the commercial LLM companies give ordinary users agents, forget you ever heard about OpenClaw, which was less a product than a vehicle for Peter Steinberger to get himself hired by OpenAI, so that he could make a financial killing.",

                  "text": "So you're repeatedly asking people to tell you why, you already know the main reason, local llm usage, but for some reason your expecting some other profound answer. Maybe instead of being obnoxious, you can do further independent research as to why local llms on a Mac mini is better than just a plain old Linux server. I run a proxmox cluster, all my nodes run Linux, I have some used for local llm, but if I could get a Mac mini placed on my network with 64gb+ ram, I would in a heartbeat, if I had the money to blow I'd go for a Mac studio with 512gb ram even quicker. And I say this having 128gb ram on a cluster node, and 256gb ram I could have running on and precision, but even then, it's not specifically about the ram size but how apple treats ram. If you can't learn and figure out from there and get off your high horse of, ho ho ho, why not just use Linux? Openclaw can run on tiny Linux VM, then your further placing your ignorance on exhibition.\n\nAlso no need to be crappy to people talking in non English languages. We live in a day of easy free access to powerful technology. The translate feature on Reddit works pretty well, no need to be an English snob.",

For me it’s not really about needing crazy power for OpenClaw. It’s more like: I could grab a used M1 Mac mini for 200–300 bucks, clone my setup over, and just have my actual work machine running headless.\n\nYeah, the M1 is complete overkill if you’re just calling GPT/Claude via API. But I don’t see OpenClaw as “just a terminal with an LLM”. For me it’s more like a personal digital assistant that can actually do stuff, open my browser, log into my apps, interact with my tools, handle random workflows. And that’s just way smoother if it lives in the same ecosystem as everything else I use daily.\n\nI’ve got a couple old Windows laptops lying around too. Thought about just throwing Claw on one and calling it a day. But then it starts: logging into every service again, setting up all accounts, no iCloud sync, no shared clipboard, no AirDrop, no Keychain, etc. All solvable, sure. Just more friction.\n\nSo I don’t think it’s about “having too much money”. It’s more about minimizing friction in your existing setup. If you’re already deep in Apple land, a cheap Mac mini just feels like the path of least resistance",

Combine this with the fact that most developers use MacOS as their daily driver at work, and that MacMini can also scale to support a smallish LLM like Gemma 3, and you get a small versatile platform that supports all usecases that OpenClaw wants. Not only that, but OpenClaw becomes contained on one machine. If OpenClaw ruins your macmini, you can reset it. \n\nNow consider that the type of people who would jump on OpenClaw pre-hype, are tech people (i.e. well paid), and the price of macmini is a no brainer.",

On the other hand, Ollama cloud Max is 100 a month, and you can run a model that you can't run on the Mac Mini. \n\nOne can argue that, you only pay once for the Mac Mini, but 2000 is enough for 20 months of Ollama cloud Max. 20 months later, we are probably at a point that the 64GB Mac Mini would be too slow to run even the dumbest model.\n\nAnd, I haven't even gotten into folks who buy a Mac Mini, but use Claude.",

I love the UI, the whole experience etc. Right now I'm on a PC (gaming reasons) but I've worked in a MacBook for years. I also own an old Mac mini. \n\nHAVING SAID THAT were talking about a server. A headless machine. One you can close on your attic or in a closet. One you access via terminal or browser anyway. So there is no difference, since you access it from ANOTHER CLIENT. Like your laptop. It mobile. Or desktop. And there is no difference between ssh to a Linux and ssh to Mac. Am I wrong? Openclaw isn't and app. You install it via terminal. \n\nOr... You use it as your desktop computer anyway? What's the deal about the UI and ecosystem?",

The Mac mini phenomenon for OpenClaw has two distinct use cases that get conflated:\n\n1. \\*\\*API-only users\\*\\* (what your EDIT addresses): You're right, a $50 HP thin client is plenty. Linux isn't scary for anyone who can set up OpenClaw. The Mac makes zero financial sense here.\n\n2. \\*\\*Local LLM users\\*\\*: Mac Silicon unified memory is arguably the cheapest way to get 24+GB of VRAM for local models right now. GPU prices are insane. An M4 mini with 24GB RAM can run decent local models for \\~$700, which is hard to beat with discrete GPU setups.\n\nThe confusion came from YouTube influencers who saw \"Mac mini + AI\" content and ran with it without understanding \\*why\\* the recommendation existed. Many buyers probably don't need the local LLM capability but bought into the hype.\n\nFor pure API use with OpenClaw? Your thin client setup is the rational choice.",

I bought one on Black Friday for $400. That’s not an exhaustive list, not even a week’s worth of shit it does. I’d pay a hell of a lot more than $400 for a year’s worth of what it will be doing. People who say they have agents running 24/7x365 feel like the same people telling you to work and optimize every picosecond of your life. I would love to see what dogshit they are doing. \n\nMy API costs have been reasonable after bumping to sonnet. I don’t need a rocket scientist and if I do I switch to the slack channel with the giga brain model. Running a local llm would be great but I’ll get a dedicated machine for that if I do.

When we ask an LLM to write a poem, it's functionally the same as asking it to follow extremely specific instructions, it's just about how creative we're allowing it to be or not be. In the LLM that's controlled by the \"temperature\". When it's \"hallucinating\" it's simply being more creative. Sometimes it's too creative and inappropriately makes shit up problematically, only then do we accuse it of \"hallucinating\" inappropriately.",

Pass it only retrieved context and require citations.\n\t2.\tExplicit uncertainty handling\nForce it to say “insufficient information” if no strong match is found.\n\t3.\tTool boundaries\nSeparate:\n      •   Code generation\n      •   Analysis\n      •   Knowledge retrieval\n      •   Execution\n\t4.\tLogging + inspection\nIf you can’t see what context it used, you can’t debug drift.\n\nAs for models:\n   •   For reasoning + structured outputs: Opus / GPT-class frontier models tend to be strongest.\n   •   For cost-efficient local pipelines: DeepSeek variants and strong open weights are very usable when paired with good retrieval.\n   •   For code specifically: dedicated code-tuned models usually outperform general ones.\n   •   For long-context summarization: Gemini has strengths, but you still need guardrails.\n\nIf you’re hitting quotas, the practical approach isn’t “find the magic model.” It’s:\n   •   Use a high-reasoning model for planning.\n   •   Use a cheaper model for execution steps.\n   •   Use retrieval to reduce hallucination surface area.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is there is no model that “doesn’t hallucinate.” There are only systems that constrain them.\n\nModel choice matters.\n\nSystem design matters more.",

It helps them \"break out\" of idea loops when they are stuck.  Their [SOUL.md](http://SOUL.md) says you cannot work on the same thing back to back.\n\nHere are the real game changes\n\n* Set their \"think\" level to high (https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/thinking)\n   * ~~Docs says this only works for GPT or Codex models.  It works for MiniMax 2.5~~\n   * If this is not set - it defaults to \"Low\"\n* I used Claude Code to get most of this configured.  I didnt trust OpenClaw to configure itself until i set it to xhigh.  Now \"Gus\" has been able to fix most of his open problems.\n\nSo why do I say its useful?  It took 2 weeks, but Tib is now generating good ideas with a validation framework.  Bou has helped me further secure the environment and drummed up some interesting ideas as well.  Vector.. well.. vector isnt useful yet.\n\n  \n**\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*** \\- While I had set the config to xhigh, i was downgraded to high.  So MiniMax2.5 only supports \"high.\"  Still, this configuration is useful.  Some people have fairly poked at it in the comments - useful is in the eye of the user.  Its not making money or solving world hunger... but its working autonomously throughout the day on a cheap LLM  and providing value to me.  This is why I shared.",

They used Claude Code as the scaffolding for SWE-Bench but \"overrode the default system prompt.\" That's a meaningful detail. What they replaced it with could significantly affect results. They also averaged over 4 runs, which is fine, but cherry-picking the best scaffolding for their model while reporting results against competitors who may have been tested under different conditions is a common way to inflate numbers.  \nSeveral of their benchmarks are internal. VIBE-Pro, RISE, GDPval-MM, MEWC, and Finance Modeling are all their own benchmarks. When you create and evaluate on your own benchmarks, you can (consciously or not) optimise for them. A 10B active parameter MoE model likely handles things very differently from a full frontier model. I'm seeing this as a \"for a massive cost saving, I would take a 20% hit on getting shit done, compared to a SOTA model\" Appreciate you posting your findings though dude",

The two above (and probably many other alternatives) seem cleaner but it might be a simplistic judgement. \n\nHas anyone migrated to another project yet? \n\nIt starts to be extremely difficult to have a good comparison between all of them. I would love a YT channel that test all of them in deep! \n\n\n\nThanks for any feedback",

          "text": "Full disclosure: I'm an OpenClaw power user running it daily on a Mac Mini for business automation, so I'm biased, but I can speak to what actually works in production.\n\nThe 'vibe-coded' concern is valid on the surface. The codebase moves fast and it doesn't have the polished UI that some alternatives ship with. But here's what I've found matters more in practice:\n\n1. **Tool ecosystem depth.** OpenClaw's browser control, file system access, exec, and multi-channel messaging (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, etc.) actually work reliably. I run sub-agents that send emails, post to social media, manage files, and interact with APIs all day. The alternatives I've tried either don't support half these integrations or they break under real workloads.\n\n2. **Heartbeats and cron.** This is the killer feature nobody talks about. My agent checks email, monitors things, and runs scheduled tasks without me touching it. I haven't seen another project nail autonomous background execution like this. The comment above about Agent Zero not having heartbeat functionality is exactly what I mean.\n\n3. **Sub-agent spawning.** I can spin up isolated agents for specific tasks, steer them mid-run, and have them report back. It's actual multi-agent orchestration, not just chat with one model.\n\n4. **Community and velocity.** The Discord is active and the devs ship constantly. When something breaks, it usually gets patched within days. With smaller projects, you're betting on one or two maintainers.\n\nThe tradeoff is real though. Setup is harder than 'docker compose up'. The memory system is file-based (MEMORY.md) rather than a nice vector DB UI. And yeah, there's no dashboard out of the box (I built my own).\n\nFor someone who wants a polished experience with minimal config, the alternatives might genuinely be better. For someone who needs an agent that can actually DO things autonomously across multiple channels and tools, OpenClaw is still ahead in my experience.",

You could also use a cheap Linux VPS or even a Raspberry Pi as another commenter mentioned, but I like having a local machine for browser automation.\n\n**API costs:** This varies depending on usage. For my setup (agent running all day handling emails, social media, file management, scheduled tasks), I spend roughly $50-80/month on API calls. If you use a cheaper model for routine tasks and only bring in the expensive ones for complex reasoning, you can keep it lower. Some people run it for under $20/month with lighter workloads.\n\n**Setup difficulty:** I won't sugarcoat it - if you have zero technical background, the initial setup will take some effort. You need to be comfortable with a terminal, installing Node.js, and editing config files. The docs are solid though, and the Discord community is genuinely helpful for setup questions.\n\n**What it actually does for me daily:** Checks and summarizes my email, monitors social media, runs scheduled marketing tasks, manages files, drafts responses, and handles repetitive business operations that used to eat 2-3 hours of my day.\n\nIf you're serious about it but the technical side is intimidating, I'd recommend starting with the docs at docs.openclaw.ai and joining the Discord. Plenty of non-devs have gotten it running with community help. The learning curve is front-loaded - once it's set up, you mostly just talk to it.",

I message the agent, it responds and takes action. Cron jobs and heartbeats run in the background and push notifications to me through the same channel. Sub-agents report results back into the conversation.\n\nFor actual monitoring, I have a basic HTML page the agent renders through Canvas that shows active cron jobs, recent activity, and system health. Nothing production-grade - took maybe an afternoon to set up.\n\nIf you want something more visual, some people in the Discord have built nicer web interfaces on top of Canvas.

The heartbeat fires into the same session as your main conversation, so the agent has full context of what you've been working on, your preferences, and your pending tasks. It can check email, glance at your calendar, and decide whether something is worth interrupting you about - all in one pass.\n\nRegular cron jobs are isolated. They fire, do one thing, and exit. They don't know what you talked about 20 minutes ago or that you mentioned you're in meetings all afternoon. The heartbeat does.\n\nAlso, you can edit a HEARTBEAT.md file to dynamically change what the agent checks for without touching any config or restarting anything. So yeah, at the infrastructure level it's a timer + prompt, but the execution context is what makes it actually useful.",

Playwright (which OpenClaw uses under the hood) needs specific system libraries. Run `npx playwright install-deps` and it will install everything.\n\n2. If you are running in a minimal container or VPS without a display server, you might need `xvfb` as a virtual framebuffer. Though honestly, Playwright's headless mode should work without it if configured correctly.\n\n3. Check your Node version. Anything below v18 can cause weird browser launch failures.\n\n4. On some Ubuntu setups, Chromium snap packages conflict with Playwright's bundled browser. Uninstall the snap version if you have it.\n\nI run mine on a Mac Mini so I sidestep most of the Linux headless issues, but the Discord has a dedicated troubleshooting channel where people have solved basically every VPS configuration you can think of. Worth searching there with your specific error message.",

I was using agent 0 to write code, I wish it had a full IDE. I was also able to get agent to login to some test linux vps/s via ssh and install software and configure it. For example, I told it to build me a lamp stack using postgres and it did. What I don't like is agent gets stuck too much and you have to nudge it.",

      "text": "I'm a software engineer at a big tech company in the Bay Area, and I need to be honest about something: AI has been making me miserable. \n\nNot because of the technology itself — I love it. But because every single day there's a new model, a new tool, a new story about someone building something incredible over a weekend. And every single day I go to bed thinking: \"Why haven't I done anything with this yet?\" \n\nFor the past months, here's what my \"keeping up with AI\" actually looked like: \n\n* Bookmarked 100+ tutorials. Completed: 0.\n* Started 10 side project ideas. Shipped: 0.\n* Spent hours on AI Twitter every night instead of sleeping.\n* Could barely focus at work because I was too busy worrying about what I wasn't building.\n\nI was consuming everything and producing nothing. \n\nThen I came across a quote from Dan Koe that genuinely changed something in me: \"Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words.\" \n\nAnd it clicked. I had all the information in the world. I live in Silicon Valley. I work in tech. I read every paper, every launch post, every HN thread. But none of that mattered because I wasn't doing anything with it. \n\nInformation without action is just entertainment. \n\n**The loop I was stuck in:**\n\n If you're a SWE, you probably know this one: \n\n* Busy at work → too drained to do anything else\n* Free time → everything feels like it pays less than your day job, so why bother\n* Repeat forever\n\nI was stuck here for months. Ideas, tools, skills — everything except output. \n\n**What changed:** \n\nI decided to stop optimizing and just start. I picked the smallest, dumbest thing I could actually finish in a week and I did it. It wasn't impressive. It wasn't original. But it was done. And \"done\" felt better than 6 months of \"planning.\" \n\nThe thing I realized is that the gap between \"I should build something\" and \"I built something\" feels enormous, but the actual work to cross it is surprisingly small. The hard part isn't the building. It's giving yourself permission to build something imperfect. \n\n**What I've learned so far:**\n\n* Perfectionism is procrastination in a nice outfit\n* The FOMO doesn't disappear when you start. But it changes from \"I'm falling behind\" to \"I wonder what I should try next.\" That's a much healthier feeling.\n* Nobody cares about your project as much as you fear they will. Which is actually freeing.\n* OpenClaw has been a big part of what got me excited about building again. Having your own AI running locally makes the whole thing feel less abstract and more like a tool you actually own.\n\nI'm not writing this to flex or give advice. I'm writing it because I spent 6 months paralyzed and I know a lot of people in this community are in the same spot.\n\nIf that's you: just pick one thing. The smallest possible thing. And finish it this week.\n\nWhat's the thing you've been putting off? Genuinely curious.",

You end up just coding your own Python scripts with Opus that are static & deterministic scripts that you end up plugging into Openclaw, so you can get something dependable, which undermines the whole reason for the damn thing existing in the first place.\n\nSure, you can squeeze some value out of it for low-stakes stuff like summarizing an email or doing basic log parsing, but that isn’t why people reach for OpenClaw.\n\nThe moment you want real autonomy: planning ... sequencing tasks, recovering from mistakes, making sensible decisions in a dynamic enviornment, without you babysitting it, Opus is the only thing I’ve seen that consistently delivers.\n\nSonnet can get close in some workflows, but the cost equation is rough if you’re running it the way OpenClaw needs you to run it.\n\n***I'm not going to take out a 2nd mortgage on my house to buy the API tokens needed to run OpenClaw effectively since i can't run OAuth with my max plan.....***\n\nUntil there’s an Opus-level model available at a price normal humans can use (or an open-weights equivalent that the Chinese steal & release that's actually that smart), OpenClaw is going to keep feeling like a great chassis with the lawnmower engine.\n\nBut then again, that's why they have menus in restaurants right?
