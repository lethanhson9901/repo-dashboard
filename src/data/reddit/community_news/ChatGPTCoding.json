It has been a pain debugging things though. Anyways, i started working on making a terminal app and its become apparent to me that ChatGPT seems to be better at figuring out problems and solving them, while claude code will roll out 10 patches for me to test with little to no progress problem solving.\n\nSo far ive been just using chatgpt 5.2 on web to give instructions to claude code, but i was wondering about just having chatgpt run in my linux machine and do the coding for me, but wasn't really sure what to buy. Is a subscription going to get me that, or do i need to pay for API or what?\n\n  \nCan I still have claude code, but let chatgpt do the coding tasks? Is codex the same thing as chatgpt?\n\n  \njust a heads up im not really a programmer, ive been having claude code do all my coding for me for the past month using their max $200 sub.",

It has several steps, but is pretty awesome and worth it, in my opinion.\n\nFirst, if you aren’t set up with it already, then set up an account with OpenRouter. It will let you switch between a wide variety of models with a single AI code companion. NOTE: You will still have to configure your OpenRouter account with API keys from each LLM provider (i.e. you need to connect your OpenRouter to your OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. accounts).\n\nIf you aren’t using it already, install VSCode, then install either the GitHub Copilot Chat extension or the Roo Code extension.\n\nOpen either the GitHub Copilot Chat or the Roo Code extension and then you can play around with the list of models you have available. And with Roo Code, you can even configure it so when it’s doing a specific type of work in a task, to use a specific model. So like I have it using GPT 5.2 Codex for looking through the code, debugging, and coding itself. But then when it does something like write documentation or an implementation plan for me, it automatically uses Sonnet 4.5\n\nI know it sounds like a lot. But it’s not too bad. Once you are set up, you will be insanely productive. DM me if you need help or have any questions",

Some find that means Codex skips details or goes off spec more often.\n\nI have tested them both. With claude I often get \"what i asked for\", codex needs a few iterations and more awareness from me.",

The project is called **WFGY 3.0 · Tension Universe**. It started as a 16-problem RAG failure map for engineers (now used in a few AI / RAG projects), and 3.0 is the “story layer” on top: 131 S-class tension questions that act like a candidate *new science* for how worlds break, heal, or transform.\n\nFor writers, you can treat it as a **tension-first sci-fi engine**:\n\n* pick one or two of the 131 questions (e.g. “what happens when a whole civilization keeps the wrong tension ledger?”)\n* ask your model to use the TXT as its “tension physics textbook”\n* let it first explain the tension geometry (who pays the cost, where the pressure moves), then build characters, factions, and plot around that\n\nThe whole thing is MIT-licensed and lives in a single human-readable TXT pack, so you can:\n\n* use it as a prompt-bundle / system prompt for AI writing\n* or just read the questions and use them as a personal sci-fi idea atlas, without AI at all\n\nI’m especially looking for feedback from writers on:\n\n* which kinds of tension questions are most inspiring for actual stories\n* where the “tension science” is too abstract or needs more concrete language\n* what kind of companion docs or examples (story seeds, arcs, world templates) would make this genuinely useful in your workflow\n\nRepo (with TXT pack + docs): 👉 [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY)\n\nIf you try it with your own AI writing setup and hit something interesting (or broken), I’d really love to hear what happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqutgl0l4glg1.png?width=4955&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec81542ea7df45356eed3d0cbc664d7747fe9eba\n\n",

I’ve been using AC⚡DC as a **\"High-Speed Wedge\"** in my workflow:\n\n1. **Code fast with AC⚡DC** for 90% of the work (UI is a webapp with Monaco/side-by-side diffs, so it feels fluid).\n2. **Use a slower agent** only when I hit a logic wall that needs agentic work.\n3. **Jump back to AC⚡DC** to keep the momentum.\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n* **4-Tier Prompt Caching (L0-L3):** Designed to hit provider-level cache breakpoints (like Anthropic’s) so you aren't paying to re-ingest your repo every time you send a message.\n* **Structural Context:** Uses Tree-sitter (Py, JS/TS, C++) to give the LLM a symbol map of the repo without wasting tokens on full-file boilerplate.\n* **Code Review Mode:** A dedicated UI to pick a commit, soft-reset, and have the LLM walk through the changes with you before they land.\n\n**Looking for feedback:**\n\nI’ve dogfooded this almost entirely on Linux. I’ve included standalone binaries for **macOS** and **Windows** in the release, but I’m curious to hear from Mac/PC users if the webapp boots and connects properly on those systems.\n\n**Repo & Demo Videos:** [https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder](https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder)\n\nIt’s free/open-source.
