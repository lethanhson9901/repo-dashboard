For example, is one noticeably better at scaffolding while another is better at debugging or refactoring?\n\n**If you’ve mainly settled on one:** How does it stack up against the major incumbents like **Codex** or **Anthropic’s Claude** models?\n\nI’m specifically looking to hear if these newer models offer a distinct advantage or feel different to drive, or if they just feel like \"more of the same.\"\n\nThanks for sharing your insights!",

Minimax m2.5, glm 5, kimi 2.5, opus 4.6, sonnet 4.5, codex 5.3 etc were given exact same detailed task.\n\nCodex came on top, opus next. Glm and kimi afterwards. Minimax failed horribly. Lots of hallucinations here and there. Glm was a bit slow but result was good. Kimi in between.\n\nConclusion wasn't generated by me directly. It was Claude and Codex that decided this result, together, weighted. Which means Claude decided the solution generated by codex were better than the opus.\n\nI suggest you try same thing in multiple models, and decide for yourself. Everyone has their own style and benchmark that won't match others.",

Opus has more knowledge and ideas. GLM is mid. Minimax is outright stupid.

Interesting that I am seeing much more frequent compacting and what *appears to be* (could be my misconception) more “confusion” (as evidenced by re-reading docs, etc. and going on tangents) after compaction. With prior models in the codex CLI I perceived better sustained focus and less frequent compacts. Maybe it’s just circumstantial…",
