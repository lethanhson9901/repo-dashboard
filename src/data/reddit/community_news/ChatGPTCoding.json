For example, is one noticeably better at scaffolding while another is better at debugging or refactoring?\n\n**If you’ve mainly settled on one:** How does it stack up against the major incumbents like **Codex** or **Anthropic’s Claude** models?\n\nI’m specifically looking to hear if these newer models offer a distinct advantage or feel different to drive, or if they just feel like \"more of the same.\"\n\nThanks for sharing your insights!",

But if you throw it at anything with extended writing or prose mixed into code (like generating docs alongside the code), it tends to get flaky around longer outputs. Not hallucinating, just... losing the thread. Works around it by chunking those tasks.\n\nMinimax M2.5 surprised me. Better than I expected for structured code where the spec is clear. Where it falls apart is ambiguous requirements - it will confidently generate something plausible that misses the point entirely. Needs clearer prompts than Claude or Codex.\n\nGLM-5 I've used less extensively but found it solid for smaller, well-scoped tasks. Starts to drift on multi-file refactors.\n\nFor straight coding against clear specs: Kimi K2.5 or Minimax are both worth it at their price point. For anything requiring back-and-forth reasoning about requirements: still reaching for Claude or Codex.",

It's like it was trained to always produce something rather than say \"I need more info.\"\n\nFor debugging specifically, I've found Opus still has the best intuition for \\*why\\* something is broken, not just pattern-matching the fix.

It has been a pain debugging things though. Anyways, i started working on making a terminal app and its become apparent to me that ChatGPT seems to be better at figuring out problems and solving them, while claude code will roll out 10 patches for me to test with little to no progress problem solving.\n\nSo far ive been just using chatgpt 5.2 on web to give instructions to claude code, but i was wondering about just having chatgpt run in my linux machine and do the coding for me, but wasn't really sure what to buy. Is a subscription going to get me that, or do i need to pay for API or what?\n\n  \nCan I still have claude code, but let chatgpt do the coding tasks? Is codex the same thing as chatgpt?\n\n  \njust a heads up im not really a programmer, ive been having claude code do all my coding for me for the past month using their max $200 sub.",

It has several steps, but is pretty awesome and worth it, in my opinion.\n\nFirst, if you aren’t set up with it already, then set up an account with OpenRouter. It will let you switch between a wide variety of models with a single AI code companion. NOTE: You will still have to configure your OpenRouter account with API keys from each LLM provider (i.e. you need to connect your OpenRouter to your OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. accounts).\n\nIf you aren’t using it already, install VSCode, then install either the GitHub Copilot Chat extension or the Roo Code extension.\n\nOpen either the GitHub Copilot Chat or the Roo Code extension and then you can play around with the list of models you have available. And with Roo Code, you can even configure it so when it’s doing a specific type of work in a task, to use a specific model. So like I have it using GPT 5.2 Codex for looking through the code, debugging, and coding itself. But then when it does something like write documentation or an implementation plan for me, it automatically uses Sonnet 4.5\n\nI know it sounds like a lot. But it’s not too bad. Once you are set up, you will be insanely productive. DM me if you need help or have any questions",

One tip for game dev specifically: for spatial problems like your bounding box grid spawner, try adding \"think step by step and consider edge cases\" to your prompt. The web versions give longer responses because they're optimized for completeness over speed. If you want IDE speed with web-level thoughtfulness, look for tools that let you adjust the 'effort' or 'thinking' parameter - some AI coding tools let you dial up reasoning even in the IDE. For game dev specifically, the extra thought time often catches physics edge cases that matter for collision detection.",

I’ve included standalone binaries for **macOS** and **Windows** in the release, but I’m curious to hear from Mac/PC users if the webapp boots and connects properly on those systems.\n\n**Repo & Demo Videos:** [https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder](https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder)\n\nIt’s free/open-source.
