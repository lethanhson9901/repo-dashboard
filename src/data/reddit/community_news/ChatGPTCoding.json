For example, is one noticeably better at scaffolding while another is better at debugging or refactoring?\n\n**If you’ve mainly settled on one:** How does it stack up against the major incumbents like **Codex** or **Anthropic’s Claude** models?\n\nI’m specifically looking to hear if these newer models offer a distinct advantage or feel different to drive, or if they just feel like \"more of the same.\"\n\nThanks for sharing your insights!",

What keeps biting me is that the model tends to write way more code than the job needs, spiral into over engineering, and go on side quests that look productive but do not move the feature forward.\n\nSo I treat the initial output as a draft, not a finished PR. Either mid build or right after the basics are working, I do a second pass and cut it back. Simplify, delete extra scaffolding, and make sure the code is doing exactly what was asked. No more, no less.\n\nFor me, gpt5.2 works best when I set effort to medium or higher. I also get better results when I repeat the loop a few times: generate, review, tighten, repeat.\n\nThe prompt below is a mash up of things I picked up from other people. It is not my original framework.

Sometimes this also brings up opportunities for abstraction that it missed the first time around. \n\nAnother tip I've seen floating around although I've only used when it comes to specs is instead of doing the entire refactor at once, **do it 5 times** at varying degrees of granularity / area of focus, so first pass on abstractions, another pass on security, 4rd on performance, etc. Each pass tend to bring up interesting areas for improvement, although your wallet might feel it.",

Not just \"does it run,\" but \"does the output actually make sense.\"\n\nWe had scripts that would execute successfully, return exit code 0, but produce garbage output — empty files, malformed JSON, stale data from a cached source instead of a fresh fetch. Everything looked fine from the outside. The agent confidently moved on to the next step using that garbage as input.\n\nThe fix was dead simple: every script that produces output now has a self-validation step baked in. Before it writes anything, it checks basic sanity — is the output non-empty? Does it parse? Are the timestamps recent? Is the data structurally what downstream consumers expect? If validation fails, it errors loudly instead of silently writing bad data.\n\nThis catches way more issues than a review pass after the fact, because by the time you’re reviewing, the agent may have already built three more things on top of the bad foundation.\n\nThe generate-review-tighten loop you described is solid for code quality. But for reliability, I’d add: make the agent prove its output is correct before moving on. Shift validation left into the generation step itself rather than relying on a human review pass to catch everything.",

The only thing an exercise like this is good for is as a measure of context rot, not how good the model is at coding, the errors you got aren’t because it can’t code correctly.

I'd get an idea for an app, open Cursor, type something like \"build me a task management app with a clean UI\" and then spend the next 3 hours fighting the AI because it picked some random stack, invented features I didn't ask for, and made everything look like a Bootstrap template from 2019.\n\nThe problem wasn't the coding agent. It was me. I was giving it garbage specs.\n\nSo over the past couple weeks I built this thing I'm calling Vibe Architect. It's basically a structured brainstorming tool where an AI architect proposes stuff and you just say yes/no/change this. You don't have to come up with anything from scratch.\n\nIt goes through phases:\n\nFirst it figures out your MVP scope (what to build, what to cut)\n\nThen it proposes design system options with actual live previews you can see in the browser\n\nThen tech stack\n\nThen it spits out markdown spec files you can feed directly to Cursor/Claude/whatever\n\nThe thing that I think actually makes this useful is that the AI doesn't ask you dumb questions like \"what font do you want?\" it just proposes 3 options and you pick one. Way faster.\n\nAlso you can stop at any step. Like if you just need help figuring out your MVP scope, cool, you don't have to go through the whole thing.\n\nIt's fully client side, your API keys stay in your browser, and it works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude.\n\nAnyway it's free and open source:\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect](https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect)\n\nLive demo: [https://specs-gen.vercel.app](https://specs-gen.vercel.app)\n\nCurious what you guys think. Also open to PRs if anyone wants to contribute.",

My threads would start focused and then turn into spaghetti because I'd ask 5 follow-up questions that weren't really part of the main flow.\n\nSo I added a feature to my extension ([GPT Threads](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm_source=item-share-cb)) where you can ask side questions in a collapsible panel. The response shows up there without cluttering your main chat. The turn still exists in ChatGPT's history (so context is preserved) but it's visually hidden so your main thread stays clean.\n\nIt's honestly changed how I use ChatGPT. I can explore tangents, ask for clarifications, or test variations without turning my chat into chaos.\n\nIf you're someone who has 50+ turn conversations that become unreadable halfway through, this might help.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear if anyone's solved this differently!\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm\\_source=item-share-cb](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm_source=item-share-cb)",

I gave the same prompt to various models in vscode, and currently testing on cursor but I got curious and fed the same prompt to the web based  chat and the code it gave me was much better (functional atleast).\n\nI am going to complete the test for the most part but since the LLM's are more or less the same across IDE's i dont know how different the results will be.\n\nLogicially it makes sense I guess because  IDE's are mostly going for speed/productivity so they dont think quite as long as web.   \n  \n I guess the real modern workflow will be using the agent for boiler plate code, changes to an existing system and using the web/desktop flow to create the initial boiler plate for large systems and just over all planning.   \n  \nFor reference im a game dev the prompt was to make a simple spawn a list of objects into rows and columns flat on the ground using their bounding boxes.",
