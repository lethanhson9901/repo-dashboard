The response included function names and parameter structures that are definitely not public information.\n\nWe never trained any custom model on our codebase. This was just standard ChatGPT. Best guess is that someone previously pasted our API docs into ChatGPT and now it's in the training data somehow. Really unsettling to realize our internal documentation might be floating around in these models.\n\nMakes me wonder what else from our codebase has accidentally been exposed. How are teams preventing sensitive technical information from ending up in AI training datasets?",

I often had to create endpoints without knowing what kind of data would be coming to them and from where, or even what method it would be arriving via. \n\nI ended up creating numerous iterations of a \"listening script\" that would fallback through every possibility I could imagine, and log the payload (assuming one even arrived, I also would seldom know if/when data was going to hit the endpoints, and would have no way to verify the entirety of the data (no API access, no replay ability, no .csv export somewhere, no third party UI to browse the data, NOTHING).\n\nAssuming something arrived, my job was to then analyze the payloads and quickly construct a \"proper\" endpoint tailored to whatever data was arriving.\n\nCan you imagine having to routinely deal with such horrors? Well, I am sure you can because the other side of that same equation is what you are describing. It may be more common to approach it from your vantage point (frontend without knowing what the backend looks like) - I have also been there on a number of occasions and it is a playground for anybody who does heavy scraping. Also valuable security information: if the backend is constructed poorly, an unauthorized user can edit or delete things they shouldn't be able to, or more commonly, access and read data that should otherwise be restricted from them. \n\nAs a developer, knowing these kind of attack vectors is invaluable. \n\nEven if I have your entire documentation and source code, it should pose zero risk to your actual system. If somebody having your entire source code is a security vulnerability, you've messed up somewhere along the way. :)",

The point was to understand *why* some developers are calling Codex a “Cursor killer” and whether that idea holds up once you actually run tasks.\n\nI tried two execution scenarios on the same small web project.\n\nOne task generated a complete website end to end.\n\nAnother task ran in an isolated Git worktree to test parallel execution on the same codebase.\n\n**What stood out:**\n\n* Codex treats development as a task that runs to completion, not a live editing session\n* Planning, execution, testing, and follow-up changes happen inside one task\n* Parallel work using worktrees stayed isolated and reviewable\n* Interaction shifted from steering edits to reviewing outcomes\n\nThe interesting part wasn’t code quality. It was where time went. Once a task started, it didn’t need constant attention.\n\nCursor is still excellent for interactive coding and fast iteration. Codex feels different. It moves execution outside the editor, which explains the “Cursor killer” label people are using.\n\nI wrote a deeper technical breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/codex-app-the-cursor-killer) with screenshots and execution details if anyone wants the full context.",

The point about Codex treating work as a task that runs to completion instead of a constant back and forth editing session really resonates, especially for anyone who’s juggling multiple things at once. The isolated worktree example was also a great, concrete way to show how parallel execution changes how you review and reason about changes. Even if it’s not a “Cursor killer,” this made it clear why people are excited about it as a different mental model for getting real work done.",

If anything was off, you would see or feel it quickly with manual testing.  \n  \nIt's a little game engine or more a techdemo based on bevy3d with server side (multiplayer) physics and  a complex \"flooding detection\". Think of the game \"Barotrauma\" in 3D -> everything is underwater, apart from a sealed underwater space station and a submarine thingy with doors. You can open doors, and the station or vehicle gets flooded, you can close them and it's dry again. You can swim in the waters outside closed off rooms or vehicles.\n\nSo these calculations around this + physics when driving the submarine and walking in it are quite complex. Took a lot of time and work to get them right (with a lot of help by gpt 5.2 recently) and they would easily break if the refactoring seriously broke anything. Also because, as I wrote above, they are all synced with the server, it will be a multiplayer game.\n\nI tested all features of the \"game\" (techdemo) afterwards and the only thing that stopped working were the bullets of the gatling gun. They didn't show and fly around anymore when I pulled the trigger. Flooding detection worked very well, which I can also say because I added multiple debug renderers that show if rooms are dry, where leaks are and from which direction the water would enter and how it would move inside rooms (colored arrows, wireframes and wireframe spheres with arrows). Flashlight, swimming, walking and collision physics still worked.\n\nHope you got curious, I have been working on this at a rate of 8 hours per month for roughly 5 years. lol. I hope to release it before 2040. Lol.",

Minor tweaks as it had problem with write_to_file due to the size of the smaller files, which was overcome by instructing Opus 4.6 to break the error into smaller steps (smaller files with roughly 200 lines of code each). This was with constant compiling after each phase (7 phases overall) and multiple push to device checking. I had been putting that refactoring off for weeks, out of fear of truncating, but used Opus 4.6 1m context and no loss of code at all. It did that and pushed to a branch after each phase, then after testing, merged with master/origin. Superpower",

But then further down the line when doing something else completely remove it without mention.\n\nSmall example: makes a feature to move and place things on the screen.\n\nLater after adding more features forgets it did this and I can now no longer move or place items\n\n\nIs there things/commands I should tell it to do to stop it forgetting or overwriting like this?\nThanks for any help!",
