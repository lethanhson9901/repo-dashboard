That’s my prediction anyways.",

With the mods’ permission, we thought it’d be fun (and useful) to do an AMA here.\n\nA few weeks ago,we used our own autonomous agent (Quest) to refactor itself. We described the goal, stepped back, and let it run. It worked through the interaction layer, state management, and the core agent loop continuously, for about 26 hours. We mostly just reviewed the spec at the start and the code at the end. We’ve made good progress, and would like to talk openly about what worked, what broke, and what surprised us.\n\n# What we’re happy to chat about:\n\nHow that 26-hour run actually went\n\nOur spec to build to verify loops, and why we think they matter for autonomous coding\n\nVibe coding, agent workflows, or anything else you’re experimenting with\n\nOr honestly… anything you’re curious about\n\nTechnical deep dives welcome.\n\n# Who’s here:\n\nMian (u/Qoder\\_shimian): Tech lead (agent + systems)\n\nJoshua (u/Own-Traffic-9336) :Tech lead (agent execution)\n\nKarina (u/Even-Entertainer4153) : PM\n\nNathan (u/ZealousidealDraw5987) : PM\n\nBen (u/Previous\\_Foot\\_5328) : Support\n\n# Small thank-you:\n\nEveryone who joins the AMA gets a [2-Week Pro Trial](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama) with Some Credits to try Quest if you want to poke at it yourself.\n\nOur Product: [Qoder.com](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama)\n\nOur Community: r/Qoder\n\nWe’ll be around on this Tuesday to Friday reading everything and replying as much as we can.",

      "text": "I’ve been watching the whole Devin conversation fade out over the past year, and honestly, it’s been fascinating. Remember when it first dropped? Everyone was losing their minds saying it was the end of SWE jobs. Now, it's radio silence. It seems more like the idea just evaporated.\n\nThe more I talk to other builders, the more a pattern shows up. Devin didn’t fail because the ambition was wrong. It failed because it aimed at a version of autonomy the current models and tooling can’t support yet. You can’t expect a single system to magically understand your repo, rewrite your backend, run migrations, and ship a product without a ton of human constraints wrapped around it. Everyone in those comment sections was saying the same thing. The vision was cool, but the timing was off.\n\nI tried a bunch of these agents. The promise was full autonomy, but the reality still involves a lot of babysitting. You give it a task, it goes off the rails, you correct it, it sort of gets back on track. Rinse and repeat. It feels less like replacing me and more like having a really fast, sometimes frustrating intern. The whole thing seemed built for a future where LLMs were just way smarter than what we actually have.\n\nWell, let's see how the landscape shifted. Instead of trying to create a replacement engineer, tools started leaning into more realistic strengths. I’ve been testing a bunch of AI dev setups myself. Some are fun for quick demos, some for debugging, some for drafting entire modules.\n\nCursor is doubling down on code editing. Claude is building incredible reasoning chains. DeepSeek is pushing raw speed and cost efficiency. It feels less like one tool needs to do everything and more like people are building proper workflows again. Atoms, a tool that’s been emerging, leans into a multi-agent structure instead of pretending a single model can hold everything in its head. It still needs direction. You still have to review decisions. But the team-style setup makes the output a lot more predictable than relying on one giant agent that tries to guess everything.\n\nI don’t mean Claude, Atoms, or anyone else has solved the full autonomy thing. We’re not there yet and probably won’t be for a while. But compared to the Devin approach of give it your repo and pray, the newer tools feel like they’re figuring out how to work with humans rather than replace them.\n\nThe future probably isn’t a single agent doing the whole job. It’s systems that break the problem into parts and communicate what they’re doing, instead of silently rewriting your app.\n\nHas your stack changed since the Devin wave, or did you stick with whatever you were using before? What actually moved the needle for you, if anything? What’s been working for you in the long run?",

Maybe if Anthropic makes a Jules like product, we can see something closer to Devin.\n\nI'm also wondering if we'll ever see a consumer facing (I'm including hobby/power users as well) product that does what Devin does. If someone actually has a predictable autonomous coding stack, it would likely be kept internal by the companies that develop it to create their own coding products to sell.

We either have autonomous SWEs, or we don't. The implication here is an explicit conversion between energy/compute to a production ready software product. I don't think these fully automated dev environments can even produce MVPs without significant human interaction.\n\nI often compare the promises of AGI to the promises of FSD in vehicles. We've been promised FSD for basically a decade now (Tesla FSD could be pre-ordered back in 2016), but the progress towards it is still ever improving, but never accomplishing it. Even if FSD works in 99% of the situation, that's still not road safe.",

      "text": "This is a BIG UPDATE! This release adds parallel tool calling, overhauls how Roo reads files and handles terminal output, and begins a major refactor to use the AI SDK at Roo's core for much better reliability. Together, these changes shift how Roo manages context and executes multi-step workflows in a serious way! Oh, and we also added a UI to manage your skills!!\n\nThis is not hype.. this is truth.. you will 100% feel the changes (and see them). Make sure intelligent context condensing is not disabled, its not broken anymore. And reset the prompt if you had customized it at all.\n\n# Parallel tool calling\n\nRoo can now run multiple tools in one response when the workflow benefits from it. This gives the model more freedom to batch independent steps (reads, searches, edits, etc.) instead of making a separate API call for each tool. This reduces back-and-forth turns on multi-step tasks where Roo needs several independent tool calls before it can propose or apply a change.\n\n# Total read_file tool overhaul\n\nRoo now caps file reads by default (2000 lines) to avoid context overflows, and it can page through larger files as needed. When Roo needs context around a specific line (for example, a stack trace points at line 42), it can also request the *entire* containing function or class instead of an arbitrary “lines 40–60” slice. Under the hood, `read_file` now has two explicit modes: **slice** (`offset`/`limit`) for chunked reads, and **indentation** (anchored on a target line) for semantic extraction. (thanks pwilkin!)\n\n# Terminal handling overhaul\n\nWhen a command produces a lot of output, Roo now caps how much of that output it includes in the model’s context. The omitted portion is saved as an artifact. Roo can then page through the full output or search it on demand, so large builds and test runs stay debuggable without stuffing the entire log into every request.\n\n# Skills management in Settings\n\nYou can now create, edit, and delete Skills from the Settings panel, with inline validation and delete confirmation. Editing a skill opens the `SKILL.md` file in VS Code. Skills are still stored as files on disk, but this makes routine maintenance faster—especially when you keep both **Global** skills and **Project** skills. (thanks SannidhyaSah!)\n\n# Provider migration to AI SDK\n\nWe’ve started migrating providers toward a shared Vercel AI SDK foundation, so streaming, tool calling, and structured outputs behave more consistently across providers. In this release, that migration includes shared AI SDK utilities plus provider moves for Moonshot/OpenAI-compatible, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Groq, and Fireworks, and it also improves how provider errors (like rate limits) surface.\n\n# Boring stuff\n\nMore misc improvements are included in the full release notes: [https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.46.0](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.46.0)\n\n*In case you did not know,* r/RooCode *is a Free and Open Source VS Code AI Coding extension.*",

      "text": "Don't know if this is the right place but I will ask anyway. I'm currently working in a project with a small dev team and naturally, because every dev is cranking out code with agents, our PRs pile up. \n\nPersonally, I do local code reviews with turing-code-review:deep-review before creating a PR. Then I assign a teammate (sometimes two) to review. We also have Claude Code Github action that does initial review of the PR on first push.\n\nNow, there is one dev who has very strong opinions on the code patterns of the framework we use. His opinions are highly personal but valid. The code in the PR works, there a many ways to write code that solves the problem, and me and AI just chose one of many. But that developer often insists that we fix the code, the proper way, or \"his\" way. This is not a problem, an easy fix, but our queue of PRs is getting longer and longer. And PR review is often what I do too when I kick of CC with some task. \n\nBut let's ask ourselves. Why do we do code reviews? First, to do an optical check. Second, and most important, to share knowledge within the team. However, I am starting to ask myself if this is still the case. IMO to succeed with coding today you don't need to know the syntax, but you do need to be able to read the code and understand the code. And I can always ask my agent to explain the code I don't understand. So knowledge sharing, still needed?\n\nPlus, AI is much better at optical checks than humans. I refactored a big chunk of the system to use strategy pattern to reduce code duplication and Claude found crazy large amount of errors, both logical and syntactical (misspelled vars), that were missed by humans that wrote original code and did PR reviews. (This is a large legacy project written initially by not so strong engineers). So if AI is already better than humans to review the code and catch errors, do we still need optical reviews?\n\nAlso, if I potentially were a sole engineer on the project, there is nobody except AI to review my code. And this scenario, one dev who is responsible for whole system, is becoming more common. I think about this a lot but can't verbalize it or come up with a strong argument yet. I guess what I am thinking of here is that me and my coding agent are a team, that I am not working alone, but it's also good enough if the agent does a PR review for me. It's not perfect but maybe 80% good enough? And can a human review really find the rest and how fast? Do we really need \"human in the loop\" here?\n\nNow to my question: how do you deal with code reviews in your team today to not get stuck in PR hell and increase bandwidth and throughput? Do you use any special code review tools you find helpful? Do you have any specific strategy, philosophy or team rules? Do you still use raw GIt or did you switch to JJ or stacked PRs? \n\nI am curious to hear your workflows!",

Assuming this is an important codebase, you don't want people checking in ai generated code without it being validated by a human. Others may feel differently on that. \n\nA few years ago, we included code formatting and linting tools in the build process. The build fails if those don't pass cleanly. It was a pain to fix all the damn lint errors over some time.

This was the first thing I setup when I joined the project and also you need these automated guardrails if you want to increase your dev speed.\n\nThe problem is that most developers still look at PRs line by line and commit by commit. When I do reviews I look for weird code patterns or things that can be simplified. This is by intuition as I am experienced and have written and read a lot of code.  \n\nToday I mostly care about functionality and UX when I do reviews. I feel that this is the only sane way to spend my review time. I assume that the code implementation and logic is correct. If I start  reviewing logic and code flow I quickly run out of my brain juice because I have to concentrate and won’t have energy to review more PRs.\n\nOne thing we don’t do is UI testing (with Playwright). This is because I always found such tests brittle and hard to maintain. But maybe this can help us increase the confidence that code works?\n\nThis is just me thinking out loud but if you as a team can lift the abstraction level to focus on the functionality instead of implementation (by making sure you have a solid test harness that covers all scenarios and types of tests: unit, feature, UX) you can increase your PR review speed and remove the stupid, annoying and time and energy consuming conversations about low level stuff?\n\nHowever, this would require larger PRs that cover more functionality at once and larger PRs mean more risks that something goes wrong during release and might be harder to discover the root cause.\n\nI dunno. I guess what I am trying to say is that maybe larger PRs with clear description, good acceptance criteria, right tests is the way forward because you won’t have the time or energy to review all the code line by line and is forced to raise your review abstraction level.\n\nBut this goes against my own philosophy of small atomic release. But maybe it’s time to let go of it in the era of AI coding agents? The ways of working have changed maybe we humans need to move on too? \n\nBut I guess in the end it’s all comes down to trust …",

This frees up the human review to actually look for business logic errors instead of style nitpicks which machines are better at anyway.
