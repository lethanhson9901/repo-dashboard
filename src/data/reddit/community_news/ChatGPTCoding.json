      "text": "Hey r/ChatGPTCoding  👋\n\nWe’re a small team of devs from Qoder. With the mods’ permission, we thought it’d be fun (and useful) to do an AMA here.\n\nA few weeks ago,we used our own autonomous agent (Quest) to refactor itself. We described the goal, stepped back, and let it run. It worked through the interaction layer, state management, and the core agent loop continuously, for about 26 hours. We mostly just reviewed the spec at the start and the code at the end. We’ve made good progress, and would like to talk openly about what worked, what broke, and what surprised us.\n\n# What we’re happy to chat about:\n\nHow that 26-hour run actually went\n\nOur spec to build to verify loops, and why we think they matter for autonomous coding\n\nVibe coding, agent workflows, or anything else you’re experimenting with\n\nOr honestly… anything you’re curious about\n\nTechnical deep dives welcome.\n\n# Who’s here:\n\nMian (u/Qoder\\_shimian): Tech lead (agent + systems)\n\nJoshua (u/Own-Traffic-9336) :Tech lead (agent execution)\n\nKarina (u/Even-Entertainer4153) : PM\n\nNathan (u/ZealousidealDraw5987) : PM\n\nBen (u/Previous\\_Foot\\_5328) : Support\n\n# Small thank-you:\n\nEveryone who joins the AMA gets a [2-Week Pro Trial](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama) with Some Credits to try Quest if you want to poke at it yourself.\n\nOur Product: [Qoder.com](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama)\n\nOur Community: r/Qoder\n\nWe’ll be around on this Tuesday to Friday reading everything and replying as much as we can.",

Turning that into a proper agent usually means writing a framework or stitching tools together.\n\nThat gap is exactly why we built the MuleRun Agent Builder.\n\nThe idea is simple. Instead of writing a full agent system, you describe what you want in prompt and build an agent by combining skills. Those skills form a workflow, so the agent behaves consistently instead of acting like a single prompt. Everything runs in the cloud.\n\nWhat we designed it for:\n\n* People already using Claude for coding\n* Building agents without writing an agent framework\n* Creating agents that can be reused and published\n* Letting builders earn from agents they publish\n\nThe Agent Builder is currently in beta. We’re opening it up to builders who want to experiment, break things, and give feedback. Beta testers get credits added to their account so they can actually build and test agents, and we’re rewarding strong published agents during the beta period.\n\nNnot here to hard sell anything. Just sharing what we’re building because this subreddit already understands the problem space well. Happy to answer questions about how it works or where it fits compared to existing setups",

Gathering my snippets of what it \"thinks\" is the final solution. I then realize it gave me a better solution earlier that I forgot to commit and then I'm scrolling endlessly to find it.\n\nChatGPT's search doesn't help much unless you remember the exact function name.\n\nI've tried copying to a scratch file but it gets messy and I lose context. Starting new conversations loses the full picture. Re-asking sometimes works but the second answer is often worse. Using the 'Projects' helps at a high level, but I still end up with 3-4 threads per project and no clue which one has what I need.\n\nHow do you all deal with this? Especially when you're building something over multiple days?",

When I asked ChatGPT, it gave me exactly these recommendations I am already familiar with, which brought me to a question. Where does ChatGPT actually acquire the information it tells me? I understand that it doesn't work on a similar concept like SEO; it's trained on an existing database of posts, articles & documents, and probably also learns from users' repeating patterns. But is there actually a way a company could \"train\" or \"hack\" AI to recommend it more? For example, by spamming prompts guiding AI to recommend them?  \nIt's a cluster of questions I think might be interesting to discuss. I'd be happy to hear any input!",

So far I found these solutions to be almost as good:  \n\\- mistral vibe cli. gets slow over time though, surprisingly smart for it's model, but not for large projects. can't run more than 1-2 in parallel  \n\\- glm 4.7: very good, feels gpt 5ish\n\nI had this problem last year at the same time. Bait and switch, same as they always do. Since then I bought credits in windsurf, kilocode, openrouter, copilot. But maybe I'm missing some obvious solution?\n\n",

There’s a decay to quality until it’s repackaged into a newer model. I’ve been harping this theory consistently over the past year or so and have been pretty consistently right.
