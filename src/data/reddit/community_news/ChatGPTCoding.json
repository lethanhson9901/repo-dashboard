Glad to see I'm not the only one that gets salty when it does something extremely well then follows up with something so removed from what I asked for I struggle to remain calm.

Once you've been approved,you'll be able to post as many times as you like without issue\n\n2. A flair is required to make a post\n\n3. Certain words and phrases common with ai-written posts will result in the post being automatically filtered (including any mentions of Blackbox AI)\n\n4. Raised karma requirements \n\n5. This community will no longer appear on the front page of reddit, making it harder to find. It's unfortunate, but it will curb random bot posts \n\n6. Every few days a self promotion thread will automatically be posted to the sub. No mod approval required- you'll be able to promote as much as you like there\n\nThis next week or so will be a sort of trial run; we'll see how good the changes are at stopping spam. In the meantime, feel free to take note of whether things have improved or not and let me know. That way, I can guage what is or isn't effective \n\nWe're also planning on expanding our mod team sometime after the holidays. We'll be watching the sub and trying to see who would make the best candidates \n\n\nThe sub will be reopened in about an hour. Thank you all for your patience and feedback!",

I started wondering why I couldn't just map motions to buttons and play any PC game by moving. I started begging programmers with relevant apps to implement such a feature, but no one was interested. I had zero knowledge of programming, but eventually decided I had to build it myself, with a lot of help from Claude and ChatGPT.\n\nI built a prototype in little more than a month, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/StandieControls/BetterJoyMotion) and seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_1GiqGPq4o). It worked far better than I ever imagined. I was hoping for a fun way to replay my favorite games, but instead it became my primary and preferred way of playing games in general. My friends also enjoy it a lot.\n\nI am now in the process of making a far more expansive and user-friendly version, although that could easily take another year or two.",

Save your test cases in a CSV, run your prompt against all of them at once, see outputs side-by-side inside VS code. When you're testing against 5-10 scenarios instead of 1, you catch regressions before they hit prod.\n\n**The problem:** You spend hours perfecting a prompt. It handles your test case beautifully. You ship it. Two hours later, it fails on some edge cases you never tested. Now you're debugging, rolling things back, and scrambling to figure out which change broke what.\n\n**What Mind Rig does:** It lets you test AI prompts directly inside VS Code with your actual data structures. You can test against multiple different models, run them all at once, and compare outputs side-by-side. No setup—just install the extension and connect your Vercel AI Gateway keys.\n\n**Why it matters:** Stop shipping prompts that break on edge cases. Stop wasting 6+ hours/week context-switching. Build systematic testing into your workflow without slowing down.\n\nCompletely free and open source. Works with Claude, GPT-4, and any model supported by Vercel AI Gateway.\n\nWould love feedback from anyone building AI features.\n\nDownload Link: [https://mindrig.ai](https://mindrig.ai)",

      "text": "Hi again. Whether you’re building tools for internal use, side projects, open-source utilities, or commercial products, understanding how monetization and incentive structures affect your design decisions is increasingly important.  \n  \nOne of the dynamics we’ve observed in agent ecosystems is that monetization opportunities change how builders approach architecture, documentation, and user experience. A few patterns stand out:  \n  \nRewarding adoption shapes development priorities. When there are clear incentives for usage, builders naturally focus on reliability, onboarding experience, and developer experience because these directly affect real interactions. This aligns agent goals with real user behavior rather than internal benchmarks.  \n  \nStructured incentive programs can sharpen your product thinking. Programs that reward adoption, quality, or showcase contributions give you measurable goals beyond toy demos. These can include cash rewards, leaderboard competitions, featured placements, or tiered bonus systems tied to usage and retention.  \n  \nExposure and product feedback loops accelerate iteration. When platform incentives prioritize visibility for certain agent types or quality factors, builders get real world signals that guide improvements. These signals retention, conversions, usage patterns help you refine both technical quality and product fit.  \n  \nIn one incentive program we reviewed, publishing a “featured agent” with a strong description, quality implementation, and clear user value earned a direct bonus plus additional visibility across marketplace surfaces. This directly rewards not just technical execution but also clarity of purpose and user-centric design.  \n  \nFrom a coding perspective, this affects how you prioritize:  \n\\- Error resilience and instrumentation  \n\\- UX around prompts and interactivity  \n\\- Onboarding flows for your agent  \n\\- Monitoring and metrics collection  \n  \nSuddenly, things like structured logging, test harnesses, rollback strategies, and even pricing strategies become technical decisions, not just product ones.  \n  \nAnother pattern we’re seeing is community-level incentives. These reward knowledge sharing, tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and ecosystem support all of which make the agent ecosystem more vibrant, and help developers learn from each other faster.  \n  \nFrom a practical standpoint, thinking about monetization earlier in the build process changes your code structure. For example:  \n  \nYou might design your API handlers to support usage counts or rate tiers.  \nYou might instrument more detailed usage metrics.  \nYou might write more modular task handlers so that high usage components can scale independently.  \n  \nAll of these are technical decisions you’d make anyway but are often delayed because the initial focus is just “get it working.”  \n  \nWe’re sharing this because the future of agents isn’t only about what you can build it’s also about how your code gets used, evaluated, and sustained. Incentives and monetization frameworks add another layer of rigor that can improve your code, not just your revenue.  \n  \n**We’d love to hear from the community:**  \nWhen you think about putting a price tag or usage meter on an agent, what concerns do you have? Are there technical gaps you’re unsure how to bridge metrics, pricing logic, billing hooks, scale considerations, webhook architecture?  \n  \nLooking forward to the discussion.",

      "text": "**What it is**\n\nNikolytics Radio is a late-night jazz station for founders who work too late. 3-hour YouTube videos. AI-generated jazz. A tired DJ named Sonny Nix who checks in between tracks with deadpan observations about your inbox, your pipeline, and why that proposal is still sitting in drafts.\n\nFive volumes in five days. 70+ subscribers. 14k views on the first Reddit post.\n\nIt’s a passion project that doubles as marketing for my automation consultancy.\n\n-----\n\n**The concept**\n\nThe pitch: You’re at your desk at 3 AM. Everyone’s asleep. You put on Nikolytics Radio. A weathered voice observes your situation with dark humor. He’s been where you are. He doesn’t fix it. He just… sees it. Then plays a record.\n\nThe DJ (Sonny Nix) is a former founder who burned out and now plays jazz for strangers. He has recurring “listeners” who write in: Todd from Accounting whose job got automated, Margaret from Operations who finished her task list and doesn’t know what to do with herself.\n\nIt’s 95% vibe, 5% branding. If you removed every mention of my business, the station would still work. That’s the point.\n\n-----\n\n**The tech stack**\n\n**Music generation:** Suno\n\nI wrote 49 artist-specific prompts optimized for deep work. Each prompt targets a specific jazz style piano trio, cool trumpet, tenor ballad, etc. Settings: Instrumental only, ~3-4 min tracks, specific mood tags.\n\nExample prompt structure:\n\n```\njazz, 1950s late-night jazz combo: brushed kit, upright bass walking gently, \nwarm felted piano carrying the main theme, soft brass pads... \n[mood tags: soft, warm, slow, lounge, nostalgic]\n```\n\nGenerate 3-4 per prompt, pick the best, discard anything too busy or with abrupt endings.\n\n**Voice generation:** ElevenLabs\n\nCustom voice clone for Sonny Nix. I use their V3 model with specific audio tags:\n\n- `[mischievously]` - dry humor, irony\n- `[whispers]` - punchlines, gut punches\n- `[sighs]` - weariness\n- `[excited]` - mock ads only (ironic use)\n- `...` - pauses\n\nV3 doesn’t support some tags like [warm] or [tired], so the *words* have to carry the emotion. Write tired sentences. Sorrowful observations.\n\n**Script writing:** txt\n\nI mostly write the scripts, claude double checks for optimizations\n\n**Assembly:** Logic Pro\n\n120 BPM grid. Drop the tracks, drop the voice clips. Crossfade. Each episode is ~30 drops across 3 hours. Export as MP3.\n\n**Video:** FFmpeg\n\nStatic image + audio. One command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage \n-c:a aac -b:a 320k -shortest output.mp4\n```\n\n-----\n\n**The writing system**\n\nEach episode has 30 “drops” — short DJ segments between songs:\n\n- **Station IDs** - Quick brand hits (“Nikolytics Radio… still here.”)\n- **Bumpers** - One-liners (“The coffee’s cold. You noticed an hour ago. Still drinking it.”)\n- **Pain points** - Observations that hit too close (“Revision eight. The scope tripled. The budget didn’t.”)\n- **Testimonials** - Fictional listeners writing in\n- **Mock ads** - Parody sponsor segments (“Introducing Scope Creep Insurance…”)\n- **Dedications** - “This one goes out to everyone who almost quit today…”\n- **Recurring segments** - Pipeline Weather, Outreach Report, Inbox Conditions\n\nThe key insight: Sonny has emotional range. He’s not monotone. He moves between tired, mischievous, sorrowful. He worries about Todd. He offers brief sympathy to Sarah. Then plays a record.\n\n-----\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **The vibe is the moat.** Most automation consultants are boring. This is different enough that people share it.\n2. **Worldbuilding compounds.** Todd’s promotion arc. Margaret’s puzzle. Callbacks like “Here it’s always 3 AM.” Returning listeners feel like regulars.\n3. **Reddit got it started.** First post on r/productivity got 14k views. Someone called it “Slop Radio FM.” Now that’s a badge of honor we reference in the show.\n4. **Daily uploads built momentum.** Five volumes in five days. The algorithm likes consistency.\n\n-----\n\n**What I learned about AI voice**\n\n- ElevenLabs V3 is good but literal. It interprets quotes as character voices (breaks everything). Always paraphrase.\n- Tags only work if the model supports them. No [warm], no [tired]. The text has to do the work.\n- Regenerate 2-3x per drop, pick the best take. Same script, different reads.\n- Punchlines land in `[whispers]`. Setup is `[mischievously]`. Then stop — no extra lines after the joke lands.\n\n-----\n\n**Time investment**\n\n- Initial setup (prompts, character docs, templates): ~15 hours\n- Per episode now: ~2 hours\n  - Generate music: 30 min\n  - Generate voice drops: 30 min\n  - Assembly in Logic: 30 min\n  - YouTube upload + description: 30 min\n\n**What could be automated further**\n\n- **Voice generation** - Currently pasting drops one by one into ElevenLabs. Could batch via API.\n- **Timestamps** - Calculating from bar positions manually. Already wrote a Python script, could integrate it.\n- **YouTube description** - Template exists, still copy-pasting. Easy n8n automation.\n- **Episode assembly** - The real bottleneck. Logic Pro is manual drag-and-drop. Exploring scripted alternatives.\n\nWriting stays mine. \n\nThe dream: one-click episode generation. Not there yet, but the pieces exist.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Link**\n\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@nikolyticsradio?si=xrFpLfRKRAsZqv_B\n\nHappy to answer questions about the workflow, the writing system, or the Suno/ElevenLabs settings.\n\n-----\n\n**TL;DR:** Built a fake radio station with AI music (Suno), AI voice (ElevenLabs), and my scripts. The DJ has a character bible. There’s lore. It’s marketing for my automation business but also just… a thing that exists now. 70 subscribers in 5 days.",

      "text": "Hi everyone. We’re the MuleRun team, sharing this openly as a brand and as fellow builders in the agent ecosystem.\n\nOver the past year, we’ve been deeply immersed in how developers, coders, and domain experts build AI agents. What we repeatedly see is a familiar tradeoff in today’s tooling: low-code workflow builders are easy to start with but quickly hit capability ceilings, while code-first frameworks are powerful but come with steep engineering overhead. \n\nThis tension matters because the way we build agents shapes what we can deliver to users. When the development path itself becomes a barrier, great ideas stay stuck in prototypes.\n\nWe think there’s a practical pivot point emerging, one that’s especially relevant to this community: agents are no longer just “a bunch of prompts stitched together,” nor should they require heavy engineering frameworks just to be functional. Instead, the future of agent construction is shaped by a new paradigm that combines:\n\n* A Base Agent core that handles reasoning, planning, and task orchestration\n* Knowledge that guides it on domain tasks\n* Tools that give it capabilities like browsing, file interaction, or calculations\n* A Runtime that executes the agent reliably in production\n\nThis pattern Base Agent + Knowledge + Tools + Runtime is becoming a de facto way to think about real, production-ready agents rather than DIY hacks or rigid frameworks. \n\nWhat’s interesting for developers is how much this lowers both the entry barrier and raises the capability ceiling. Instead of choosing between a limited low-code tool or a full framework, this paradigm lets you treat natural language and code as first-class building blocks. You describe what you want at a high level, and the system maps that into a capable agent that can:\n\n* Plan multi-step actions\n* Call rich tools like browsers or databases\n* Use structured domain knowledge\n* Scale beyond simple chat loops\n\nThat doesn’t mean code goes away. On the contrary, coders can continue to define custom skills, integrate specialized libraries, and refine behavior but without managing every infrastructure detail from scratch.\n\nWe’re working on a tool that embodies this approach, and it will enter early preview soon. The idea is to let builders focus on what the agent should do, not on how to wire tools and runtimes together manually. This is especially useful if you’ve ever abandoned a promising project because your toolchain couldn’t scale, or an SDK was too complex to integrate. \n\n**In practice, this means:**\n\n* You describe what the agent needs to accomplish in natural language\n* The builder interprets that intent and configures the underlying agent core\n* Skills, tools, and knowledge components are assembled automatically\n* You get an agent that can reason, act, and be iterated on without wrestling boilerplate or glue code\n\nFor those of you who are already mixing code with LLM prompts and tool integrations, this shift matters because it lets you treat natural language as part of the development process, not just a layer for users.\n\nWe’re excited to hear from this community:\n\nWhat parts of your agent building workflow feel hardest right now tooling, abstraction, error recovery, or production readiness? What would make your next agent project easier or more powerful?",

It handles the plumbing automatically planning, reasoning, tool integration  so you can focus on the agent’s behavior and capabilities. Tools for simplifying error recovery and production stability are a big part of what we’re building, and we’re excited to see how this lowers the barrier while raising the capability ceiling.\n\nCurious what types of edge cases or reliability issues have been the most painful in your projects so far?",

I have used Codex, Claude Code, RooCode, Cline before spending time to develop my own. AI coders , like human programmers, can generate errors. You catch it by running unit tests, integrations tests. If there are errors, then you usually just ask AI coder to read the error message to fix it. Existing AI coders are fine for fixing bugs in  small code base or shallow  call stacks. They fail when the codebase is large or when the data flow is quite deep, going through several layers , the code generating bugs is actually several call stacks upper of where the error message is generated.   \nZentara solves this problem by integrating with a real, classic debugger. It feeds the LLM with the call stacks from the debugger. It can set up breakpoints and evaluate stack variables . This way, LLM receives not only the static code text, but real hot code state, helping to trouble the most subtle bugs. So you do not need to write print statement everywhere to debug the error.   \nZentara also delegates and launchs subagents to save context window for the main agent.   \nInternally, Zentara use  Language Server Protocol (LSP like in IDE), so that it understands the code at symbolic, semantic levels. It would help a lot in  your case when you need to reorganize the code frequently .   \nI am for sure biased, but Zentara really fills in the gap of something that most coding agents are missing: finding subtle logic bugs in highly connected codebase.",

CC is my primary driver,    - $20pm for CC's intermittent sessions.\n\n3. OpenCode - This is my only pay on demand experience. I use ZEN. I like that I know exactly how much things cost. I use this sparingly when I'm in a bind. The monthly price here varies but I never feel ripped off. I think the rightway to use open code is to consciously switch models depending on where you are. - \\~20pm for basically unlimited bad models with 1/2 opus sessions if I need planning\n\n4. Kiro - A great tool, chronically underrated. It's underrated because SPEC driven dev while a great idea doesn't really work autonomously. I find the design specs that build user journey most helpful. That said I almost always stay in their \"vibe\" mode. And just have the model build a plan via markdown. It's fast, and the tooling uses the models more efficiently than cursor. I don't think any tool gives you more out of their credits than kiro - $15pm for 500 credits (note 1 completion != 1 credit)\n\nCopilot and Antigravity are notable highlights. Haven't used copilot in a while but I hear that it doesn't suck anymore. And when I used antigravity I thought it was great but didn't incorporate it into my workflow because I didn't understand the pricing and usage patterns. \n\nEnd result for about $75pm I have near constant access to SOTA models. I like my workflow because by having an intelligent mix these tools all cover up the others shortcomings. I'm also exposed to different tooling ideas and i know what works in different situations.",

It simplifies \"solutions\" to the point of them not even resembling what the real world thing will be at all. It compulsively placates and if you point this out to it and ask it to be more realistic it will do a 180 degree shift and be comically over-critical and pessimistic. There is no middle ground with it for whatever reason. \n\nGemini cli sucks sloppy ass so I haven't bothered too much with code generation and stick with CC for that so I don't know if that's where the improvements have been since 2.5 but in every other respect that I've tested it's identical. Not sure what they spent however many millions of dollars on when training this thing but it didn't go so good. \n\nAlso, it's ability to glean information from the web is just terrible. It's lazy, the scraping that's built into it sucks, it will constantly give you bad info. The \"url context\" thing just doesn't work either. I gave it a reddit thread as a test and asked it to present me the usernames and posts of users as it pertains to a specific sub-topic in the thread. It came back with hallucinated users and hallucinated posts. Naturally its hallucinations of documentation, up to date conventions also sucks. I actually tried multiple times to discuss the stuff you specifically are talking about and it was just miserable. I'm using pulumi for k8s deployments and it was easier for me to just go through the docs and read their forums myself than to use it. Claude is orders of magnitude better at everything I've described here.\n\nYou can probably tell but I really fucking hate this model.",

One day I start getting PRs with whole API keys committed from one of my juniors in training. Now, he knows better than this, so obviously he pushed without checking a damn thing.

It wasn't till I asked him what model he's using, and he said 'gemini 3' that it clicked. He'd started using Antigravity for work without informing anyone, and seemed to think that 'codex' meant any agentic coding agent. \n\nIt was banned company-wide shortly thereafter. \n\nAnd yes, obviously the real issue here was a junior pushing for without proper review.

It doesn’t generate code — it does code review, security review, refactor critique, and failure-mode analysis. The default posture is “what breaks, what’s fragile, what’s wrong.”\n\n2) Second opinions / idea-bouncing  \nBefore writing code, I run architecture through a lightweight “war room” flow — multiple opinionated reviewers with different constraints (performance, infra, scalability, DX, safety, security). I modeled these after how people like Carmack, Karpathy, Vogels, Hölzle, Bret Taylor, Guillermo Rauch, Sam Blackshear, and Tal Be’ery talk about engineering best practices in their lectures and writing — they’re forced to disagree and surface tradeoffs before anything gets built.\n\nFlow-wise:\n\n* ChatGPT helps frame the problem + draft the prompt\n* Gemini writes the code\n* Ares + the war room tear it apart\n* Iterate\n\nThat combo got me much closer to having senior engineers to bounce ideas off of, without the agreeableness or false confidence.\n\nHaving GPT be adversarial to Gemini's work has been really great at finding problems/issues  before it gets unwieldily.",

I’m still experimenting a lot with this one — the current version is honestly a bit *too brainstormy*.

      "text": "TLDR: The major challenge I have right now is spotting when the AI has degraded performance before I work too much on a branch and lose time because I'll have to scrap it.\n\nTHE SITUATION:  \nI'm a UI/UX designer who's been building a mobile web app solo with AI assistance (2-6 hours daily for 4 months). The workflow is incredible for rapid prototyping, but I've hit a recurring problem: detecting when the AI starts producing lower-quality code before I've committed hours to a branch.\n\nSometimes the AI will subtly break patterns it established earlier, introduce anti-patterns, or generate code that looks fine but causes issues down the line. By the time I catch it, I've often built on top of that foundation and have to scrap significant work.\n\nMY CURRENT APPROACH:  \n\\- Expect AI to generate bugs that need human review.  \n\\- Learn to spot the early warning signs of degradation, wait out the downtime.  \n\\- Test the systems periodically for optimal performance.  \n\\- In the meantime, plan features, backend stuff, marketing, whatever!  \n\\- Expect to have to use professional developers as code validators before launch.\n\nQUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY:  \n\\- Do you have strategies for catching AI performance drops early?  \n\\- What are your red flags that the AI has \"lost the thread\"?  \n\\- Do you use specific testing/validation workflows when working with AI-generated code?\n\nI'm especially curious if anyone has developed systematic approaches to this, beyond just \"code review everything.\"",

Also, the more time you spend on the current tasks without committing, the more likely you are to spend even more trying to fix bad code before you realize it’s a lost cause.\n\nWhen coding with AI, as soon as I have something in a working state, I like to test it, and if it is good, commit it.  This likely will be 30 minute or less increments with an approach like this.  It can be tempting to keep adding one more thing before the commit, and that is likely where things fall off.\n\nAs far as drift, the longer your context window gets, the more likely the AI will drift, but I haven’t found a hard or fast rule.  I do seem it seems to be more with context getting too large than it is with time, but there are days that the model just gives garbage code.  If you see that, maybe it’s a good time to work on laying out more explicitly your requirements and have a series’s of prompts ready for when the LLM is working better.",

When I've completed and tested one of these small bits, I commit the changes, and start a new session with the coding agent by pointing it to a markdown file that I copied out an aforementioned GitHub issue. I have one main branch. I'm not sure what you're running into, but I assume you're running out of context.",
