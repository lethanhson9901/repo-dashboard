That’s my prediction anyways.",

Leadership and c suites just think AI is always a efficiency boost, but it can be a detriment for someone who knows the tools they are using well\n\nPeople are literally just removing the need to understand syntax/framework and hope that good architecture is being followed (it isn't)",

It was where time went. Once a task started, it didn’t need constant attention.\n\nCursor is still excellent for interactive coding and fast iteration. Codex feels different. It moves execution outside the editor, which explains the “Cursor killer” label people are using.\n\nI wrote a deeper technical breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/codex-app-the-cursor-killer) with screenshots and execution details if anyone wants the full context.",

The isolated worktree example was also a great, concrete way to show how parallel execution changes how you review and reason about changes.

      "text": "This is a BIG UPDATE! This release adds parallel tool calling, overhauls how Roo reads files and handles terminal output, and begins a major refactor to use the AI SDK at Roo's core for much better reliability. Together, these changes shift how Roo manages context and executes multi-step workflows in a serious way! Oh, and we also added a UI to manage your skills!!\n\nThis is not hype.. this is truth.. you will 100% feel the changes (and see them). Make sure intelligent context condensing is not disabled, its not broken anymore. And reset the prompt if you had customized it at all.\n\n# Parallel tool calling\n\nRoo can now run multiple tools in one response when the workflow benefits from it. This gives the model more freedom to batch independent steps (reads, searches, edits, etc.) instead of making a separate API call for each tool. This reduces back-and-forth turns on multi-step tasks where Roo needs several independent tool calls before it can propose or apply a change.\n\n# Total read_file tool overhaul\n\nRoo now caps file reads by default (2000 lines) to avoid context overflows, and it can page through larger files as needed. When Roo needs context around a specific line (for example, a stack trace points at line 42), it can also request the *entire* containing function or class instead of an arbitrary “lines 40–60” slice. Under the hood, `read_file` now has two explicit modes: **slice** (`offset`/`limit`) for chunked reads, and **indentation** (anchored on a target line) for semantic extraction. (thanks pwilkin!)\n\n# Terminal handling overhaul\n\nWhen a command produces a lot of output, Roo now caps how much of that output it includes in the model’s context. The omitted portion is saved as an artifact. Roo can then page through the full output or search it on demand, so large builds and test runs stay debuggable without stuffing the entire log into every request.\n\n# Skills management in Settings\n\nYou can now create, edit, and delete Skills from the Settings panel, with inline validation and delete confirmation. Editing a skill opens the `SKILL.md` file in VS Code. Skills are still stored as files on disk, but this makes routine maintenance faster—especially when you keep both **Global** skills and **Project** skills. (thanks SannidhyaSah!)\n\n# Provider migration to AI SDK\n\nWe’ve started migrating providers toward a shared Vercel AI SDK foundation, so streaming, tool calling, and structured outputs behave more consistently across providers. In this release, that migration includes shared AI SDK utilities plus provider moves for Moonshot/OpenAI-compatible, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Groq, and Fireworks, and it also improves how provider errors (like rate limits) surface.\n\n# Boring stuff\n\nMore misc improvements are included in the full release notes: [https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.46.0](https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.46.0)\n\n*In case you did not know,* r/RooCode *is a Free and Open Source VS Code AI Coding extension.*",

      "text": "Don't know if this is the right place but I will ask anyway. I'm currently working in a project with a small dev team and naturally, because every dev is cranking out code with agents, our PRs pile up. \n\nPersonally, I do local code reviews with turing-code-review:deep-review before creating a PR. Then I assign a teammate (sometimes two) to review. We also have Claude Code Github action that does initial review of the PR on first push.\n\nNow, there is one dev who has very strong opinions on the code patterns of the framework we use. His opinions are highly personal but valid. The code in the PR works, there a many ways to write code that solves the problem, and me and AI just chose one of many. But that developer often insists that we fix the code, the proper way, or \"his\" way. This is not a problem, an easy fix, but our queue of PRs is getting longer and longer. And PR review is often what I do too when I kick of CC with some task. \n\nBut let's ask ourselves. Why do we do code reviews? First, to do an optical check. Second, and most important, to share knowledge within the team. However, I am starting to ask myself if this is still the case. IMO to succeed with coding today you don't need to know the syntax, but you do need to be able to read the code and understand the code. And I can always ask my agent to explain the code I don't understand. So knowledge sharing, still needed?\n\nPlus, AI is much better at optical checks than humans. I refactored a big chunk of the system to use strategy pattern to reduce code duplication and Claude found crazy large amount of errors, both logical and syntactical (misspelled vars), that were missed by humans that wrote original code and did PR reviews. (This is a large legacy project written initially by not so strong engineers). So if AI is already better than humans to review the code and catch errors, do we still need optical reviews?\n\nAlso, if I potentially were a sole engineer on the project, there is nobody except AI to review my code. And this scenario, one dev who is responsible for whole system, is becoming more common. I think about this a lot but can't verbalize it or come up with a strong argument yet. I guess what I am thinking of here is that me and my coding agent are a team, that I am not working alone, but it's also good enough if the agent does a PR review for me. It's not perfect but maybe 80% good enough? And can a human review really find the rest and how fast? Do we really need \"human in the loop\" here?\n\nNow to my question: how do you deal with code reviews in your team today to not get stuck in PR hell and increase bandwidth and throughput? Do you use any special code review tools you find helpful? Do you have any specific strategy, philosophy or team rules? Do you still use raw GIt or did you switch to JJ or stacked PRs? \n\nI am curious to hear your workflows!",

We'll give more of a description of what's going on, or say start with this file, etc. \n\nSince you said these were juniors, schedule a meeting and have them explain the changes. Assuming this is an important codebase, you don't want people checking in ai generated code without it being validated by a human. Others may feel differently on that. \n\nA few years ago, we included code formatting and linting tools in the build process. The build fails if those don't pass cleanly. It was a pain to fix all the damn lint errors over some time. But I've been surprised how it quietly keeps a certain amount of order in place.\n\n“There is never enough time to do it right, but there is always enough time to do it over.”\n\nI feel for you.

This was the first thing I setup when I joined the project and also you need these automated guardrails if you want to increase your dev speed.\n\nThe problem is that most developers still look at PRs line by line and commit by commit. When I do reviews I look for weird code patterns or things that can be simplified. This is by intuition as I am experienced and have written and read a lot of code.  \n\nToday I mostly care about functionality and UX when I do reviews. I feel that this is the only sane way to spend my review time. I assume that the code implementation and logic is correct. If I start  reviewing logic and code flow I quickly run out of my brain juice because I have to concentrate and won’t have energy to review more PRs.\n\nOne thing we don’t do is UI testing (with Playwright). This is because I always found such tests brittle and hard to maintain. But maybe this can help us increase the confidence that code works?\n\nThis is just me thinking out loud but if you as a team can lift the abstraction level to focus on the functionality instead of implementation (by making sure you have a solid test harness that covers all scenarios and types of tests: unit, feature, UX) you can increase your PR review speed and remove the stupid, annoying and time and energy consuming conversations about low level stuff?\n\nHowever, this would require larger PRs that cover more functionality at once and larger PRs mean more risks that something goes wrong during release and might be harder to discover the root cause.\n\nI dunno. I guess what I am trying to say is that maybe larger PRs with clear description, good acceptance criteria, right tests is the way forward because you won’t have the time or energy to review all the code line by line and is forced to raise your review abstraction level.\n\nBut this goes against my own philosophy of small atomic release. But maybe it’s time to let go of it in the era of AI coding agents? The ways of working have changed maybe we humans need to move on too? \n\nBut I guess in the end it’s all comes down to trust …",

This frees up the human review to actually look for business logic errors instead of style nitpicks which machines are better at anyway.

I don’t really see added value in writing every line of code by hand instead of using AI, as long as the time I save is spent on higher level things. Before, I was kind of imprisoned by the mechanics of coding. Now I can focus more on designing better solutions, improving the experience, making things more secure, faster, more useful, and even more beautiful.\n\nIf the comparison is learning to code before versus now, I think that’s a dead end. Even if your goal is to learn, you can ask the AI to explain every decision it makes and learn from that. But once you already understand the logic, what is the added value of doing the equivalent of sums by hand? The important part is not the calculation itself. It is whether the result makes your product or your work better.",

I created instructions to make it casual 1st person, stop using cliches, (at first every product was a \"game changer\") plus add a small negative and one Tip about the product. plus a review headline.\n\nI have another project for writing a negative review, the scary thing is that it does a great job at being negative, the scary thing is that its right, I may place product info but I dont identify the product specifically and it must find other negative reviews elsewhere.\n\nMaybe its my own limitation but these products are boring and I found if hard to come up with tip, a negative if I liked the product and a catchy headline, i just wanted to get it done.\n\nBut here is the thing, I read every single word and often deleted the tip, the negative and headline, sometimes all 3,  The key test for me is  do i believe this review ?, is it me talking ?, I would revise the body as well. Sometimes I cut he  review to less then a paragraph because the product was so simple that  anything more was overkill.\n\nI mention the minutiae of creating a review because its maybe %85 accurate and I am very involved, the bottom line is that I churn out much better reviews in half the time.

Like GPT + Cursor can get you from zero to a working flow much faster than usual. Especially for demos and internal tools.\n\nHowever, I know that healthcare feels like the worst place for shortcuts to pile up. Once you think about data boundaries, logs, access control, and what happens when real patient data shows up, things get very volatile...\n\nMost setups I see use ChatGPT or Cursor, Supabase for auth and storage, and Specode to keep things from going off the rails. Anyone actually ship something like this, or does everyone quietly rebuild later?  \n",

We are waiting for implementation of a bigger system and I need something to develop bills of material and item masters.\n\nI know some vba and c, ms access but need a solution that will work for some employees using macs. \n\nSo, I’m trying to do this with chat gpt and making good progress. 2days in now\n\nI have a paid personal account.  Problem is it really starts to slow down a few hours in.  If I start a new chat, it’s fast, but I have to feed it more information to get back to having enough context.\n\nWhat am I missing?",

          "text": "This is how it works. What you're running into is called the context window. The system operates optimally when you're between 0-40%. When you send a message and it replies, it packages all of that up into the context. When you send your next message, that gets wrapped up with all of the previous messages. Wash, rinse, repeat. Not only is the system slower when you're out of context space, that's what causes hallucinations. \n\nYour best bet is to make small, incremental improvements to your code, commit that change to git, then start a new chat.",

I keep various architecture guideline documents in the root of the /docs folder, and then when I start a new feature I have the AI create a new feature implementation plan doc. We then review this doc and ask the AI to look for areas in the doc that need clarification and refinement. After a couple of rounds of dialing in the doc, I'll open a new chat and have it implement the doc. Once that's done, I commit the changes and start a new feature. Old docs go in the archive. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1qzzrspscygg1.png?width=584&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec37fc01d27b588a8dcb57d06d334d027628911c\n\n",
