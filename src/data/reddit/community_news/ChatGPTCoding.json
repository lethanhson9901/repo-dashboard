The response included function names and parameter structures that are definitely not public information.\n\nWe never trained any custom model on our codebase. This was just standard ChatGPT. Best guess is that someone previously pasted our API docs into ChatGPT and now it's in the training data somehow. Really unsettling to realize our internal documentation might be floating around in these models.\n\nMakes me wonder what else from our codebase has accidentally been exposed. How are teams preventing sensitive technical information from ending up in AI training datasets?",

I often had to create endpoints without knowing what kind of data would be coming to them and from where, or even what method it would be arriving via. \n\nI ended up creating numerous iterations of a \"listening script\" that would fallback through every possibility I could imagine, and log the payload (assuming one even arrived, I also would seldom know if/when data was going to hit the endpoints, and would have no way to verify the entirety of the data (no API access, no replay ability, no .csv export somewhere, no third party UI to browse the data, NOTHING).\n\nAssuming something arrived, my job was to then analyze the payloads and quickly construct a \"proper\" endpoint tailored to whatever data was arriving.\n\nCan you imagine having to routinely deal with such horrors? Well, I am sure you can because the other side of that same equation is what you are describing. It may be more common to approach it from your vantage point (frontend without knowing what the backend looks like) - I have also been there on a number of occasions and it is a playground for anybody who does heavy scraping. Also valuable security information: if the backend is constructed poorly, an unauthorized user can edit or delete things they shouldn't be able to, or more commonly, access and read data that should otherwise be restricted from them. \n\nAs a developer, knowing these kind of attack vectors is invaluable. \n\nEven if I have your entire documentation and source code, it should pose zero risk to your actual system. If somebody having your entire source code is a security vulnerability, you've messed up somewhere along the way. :)",

If anything was off, you would see or feel it quickly with manual testing.  \n  \nIt's a little game engine or more a techdemo based on bevy3d with server side (multiplayer) physics and  a complex \"flooding detection\". Think of the game \"Barotrauma\" in 3D -> everything is underwater, apart from a sealed underwater space station and a submarine thingy with doors. You can open doors, and the station or vehicle gets flooded, you can close them and it's dry again. You can swim in the waters outside closed off rooms or vehicles.\n\nSo these calculations around this + physics when driving the submarine and walking in it are quite complex. Took a lot of time and work to get them right (with a lot of help by gpt 5.2 recently) and they would easily break if the refactoring seriously broke anything. Also because, as I wrote above, they are all synced with the server, it will be a multiplayer game.\n\nI tested all features of the \"game\" (techdemo) afterwards and the only thing that stopped working were the bullets of the gatling gun. They didn't show and fly around anymore when I pulled the trigger. Flooding detection worked very well, which I can also say because I added multiple debug renderers that show if rooms are dry, where leaks are and from which direction the water would enter and how it would move inside rooms (colored arrows, wireframes and wireframe spheres with arrows). Flashlight, swimming, walking and collision physics still worked.\n\nHope you got curious, I have been working on this at a rate of 8 hours per month for roughly 5 years. lol. I hope to release it before 2040. Lol.",

Minor tweaks as it had problem with write_to_file due to the size of the smaller files, which was overcome by instructing Opus 4.6 to break the error into smaller steps (smaller files with roughly 200 lines of code each). This was with constant compiling after each phase (7 phases overall) and multiple push to device checking. I had been putting that refactoring off for weeks, out of fear of truncating, but used Opus 4.6 1m context and no loss of code at all. It did that and pushed to a branch after each phase, then after testing, merged with master/origin. Superpower",

It would have still been able to finish the app with a few extra messages I bet. Even the open source model can build these apps if handled correctly. The only thing an exercise like this is good for is as a measure of context rot, not how good the model is at coding, the errors you got aren’t because it can’t code correctly. Hope that make sense. \n\nIf you were asking it to create an app to simulate some kind of well known modelling equation, or drug interactions etc. That would be a harder test for it, I think.

      "text": "Agentic coding is fast, but the first draft often comes out messy. What keeps biting me is that the model tends to write way more code than the job needs, spiral into over engineering, and go on side quests that look productive but do not move the feature forward.\n\nSo I treat the initial output as a draft, not a finished PR. Either mid build or right after the basics are working, I do a second pass and cut it back. Simplify, delete extra scaffolding, and make sure the code is doing exactly what was asked. No more, no less.\n\nFor me, gpt5.2 works best when I set effort to medium or higher. I also get better results when I repeat the loop a few times: generate, review, tighten, repeat.\n\nThe prompt below is a mash up of things I picked up from other people. It is not my original framework. Steal it, tweak it, and make it fit your repo.\n\nPrompt:\nReview the entire codebase in this repository.\n\nLook for:\nCritical issues\nLikely bugs\nPerformance problems\nOverly complex or over engineered parts\nVery long functions or files that should be split into smaller, clearer units\nRefactors that extract truly reusable common code only when reuse is real\nFundamental design or architectural problems\n\nBe thorough and concrete.\n\nConstraints, follow these strictly:\nDo not add functionality beyond what was requested.\nDo not introduce abstractions for code used only once.\nDo not add flexibility or configurability unless explicitly requested.\nDo not add error handling for impossible scenarios.\nIf a 200 line implementation can reasonably be rewritten as 50 lines, rewrite it.\nChange only what is strictly necessary.\nDo not improve adjacent code, comments, or formatting.\nDo not refactor code that is not problematic.\nPreserve the existing style.\nEvery changed line must be directly tied to the user's request.",

In the case where the entire project is large / have inconsistencies -- as brownfield projects often do -- I find it helpful to let the agent 'explore' and bring me back a list of inconsistencies so I can decide when something should be refactored vs okay to leave as it is. Sometimes this also brings up opportunities for abstraction that it missed the first time around. \n\nAnother tip I've seen floating around although I've only used when it comes to specs is instead of doing the entire refactor at once, **do it 5 times** at varying degrees of granularity / area of focus, so first pass on abstractions, another pass on security, 4rd on performance, etc. Each pass tend to bring up interesting areas for improvement, although your wallet might feel it.",

After they started to charge an arm and leg, I moved to openrouter pay as you go on and tried several models. Then I discovered ChatGPT 5 Codex. It was so slick and better thinker than all the models that I'd seen before. So sticked with that. The $20 sub was generous enough but still I hit the rate limiting after a while. At that point I tried Google AntiGravity and got really impressed. It was also as good as GPT 5 Codex but faster. After hiting the limit of free version of gemini, Now I'm using their $20 month Google AI pro and still has not reached the limit. I have not checked new shiny AI stuff for a while, so I'm curious, what you guys have you been ended up in this fast pased AI coding era? \n\n ",
