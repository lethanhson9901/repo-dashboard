      "text": "I tested OpenAI’s new Codex App right after release to see how it handles real development work.\n\nThis wasn’t a head-to-head benchmark against Cursor. The point was to understand *why* some developers are calling Codex a “Cursor killer” and whether that idea holds up once you actually run tasks.\n\nI tried two execution scenarios on the same small web project.\n\nOne task generated a complete website end to end.\n\nAnother task ran in an isolated Git worktree to test parallel execution on the same codebase.\n\n**What stood out:**\n\n* Codex treats development as a task that runs to completion, not a live editing session\n* Planning, execution, testing, and follow-up changes happen inside one task\n* Parallel work using worktrees stayed isolated and reviewable\n* Interaction shifted from steering edits to reviewing outcomes\n\nThe interesting part wasn’t code quality. It was where time went. Once a task started, it didn’t need constant attention.\n\nCursor is still excellent for interactive coding and fast iteration. Codex feels different. It moves execution outside the editor, which explains the “Cursor killer” label people are using.\n\nI wrote a deeper technical breakdown [here](https://www.tensorlake.ai/blog/codex-app-the-cursor-killer) with screenshots and execution details if anyone wants the full context.",

The point about Codex treating work as a task that runs to completion instead of a constant back and forth editing session really resonates, especially for anyone who’s juggling multiple things at once. The isolated worktree example was also a great, concrete way to show how parallel execution changes how you review and reason about changes. Even if it’s not a “Cursor killer,” this made it clear why people are excited about it as a different mental model for getting real work done.",

If anything was off, you would see or feel it quickly with manual testing.  \n  \nIt's a little game engine or more a techdemo based on bevy3d with server side (multiplayer) physics and  a complex \"flooding detection\". Think of the game \"Barotrauma\" in 3D -> everything is underwater, apart from a sealed underwater space station and a submarine thingy with doors. You can open doors, and the station or vehicle gets flooded, you can close them and it's dry again. You can swim in the waters outside closed off rooms or vehicles.\n\nSo these calculations around this + physics when driving the submarine and walking in it are quite complex. Took a lot of time and work to get them right (with a lot of help by gpt 5.2 recently) and they would easily break if the refactoring seriously broke anything. Also because, as I wrote above, they are all synced with the server, it will be a multiplayer game.\n\nI tested all features of the \"game\" (techdemo) afterwards and the only thing that stopped working were the bullets of the gatling gun. They didn't show and fly around anymore when I pulled the trigger. Flooding detection worked very well, which I can also say because I added multiple debug renderers that show if rooms are dry, where leaks are and from which direction the water would enter and how it would move inside rooms (colored arrows, wireframes and wireframe spheres with arrows). Flashlight, swimming, walking and collision physics still worked.\n\nHope you got curious, I have been working on this at a rate of 8 hours per month for roughly 5 years. lol. I hope to release it before 2040. Lol.",

Minor tweaks as it had problem with write_to_file due to the size of the smaller files, which was overcome by instructing Opus 4.6 to break the error into smaller steps (smaller files with roughly 200 lines of code each). This was with constant compiling after each phase (7 phases overall) and multiple push to device checking. I had been putting that refactoring off for weeks, out of fear of truncating, but used Opus 4.6 1m context and no loss of code at all. It did that and pushed to a branch after each phase, then after testing, merged with master/origin. Superpower",

I don’t really see added value in writing every line of code by hand instead of using AI, as long as the time I save is spent on higher level things. Before, I was kind of imprisoned by the mechanics of coding. Now I can focus more on designing better solutions, improving the experience, making things more secure, faster, more useful, and even more beautiful.\n\nIf the comparison is learning to code before versus now, I think that’s a dead end. Even if your goal is to learn, you can ask the AI to explain every decision it makes and learn from that. But once you already understand the logic, what is the added value of doing the equivalent of sums by hand? The important part is not the calculation itself. It is whether the result makes your product or your work better.",

My reviews improved somewhat but im not exactly the best writer especially condensing a great deal of information down to a paragraph or two. I did it but it felt clunky.

I created instructions to make it casual 1st person, stop using cliches, (at first every product was a \"game changer\") plus add a small negative and one Tip about the product. plus a review headline.\n\nI have another project for writing a negative review, the scary thing is that it does a great job at being negative, the scary thing is that its right, I may place product info but I dont identify the product specifically and it must find other negative reviews elsewhere.\n\nMaybe its my own limitation but these products are boring and I found if hard to come up with tip, a negative if I liked the product and a catchy headline, i just wanted to get it done.\n\nBut here is the thing, I read every single word and often deleted the tip, the negative and headline, sometimes all 3,  The key test for me is  do i believe this review ?, is it me talking ?, I would revise the body as well. Sometimes I cut he  review to less then a paragraph because the product was so simple that  anything more was overkill.\n\nI mention the minutiae of creating a review because its maybe %85 accurate and I am very involved, the bottom line is that I churn out much better reviews in half the time.

Like GPT + Cursor can get you from zero to a working flow much faster than usual. Especially for demos and internal tools.\n\nHowever, I know that healthcare feels like the worst place for shortcuts to pile up. Once you think about data boundaries, logs, access control, and what happens when real patient data shows up, things get very volatile...\n\nMost setups I see use ChatGPT or Cursor, Supabase for auth and storage, and Specode to keep things from going off the rails. Anyone actually ship something like this, or does everyone quietly rebuild later?  \n",

Absolutely. You know what else people can do? Paste logs/confidential information/trade secrets into coding assistants.  \n\nYou can argue that companies can pay for their own private instances etc but there are zero guarantees your data isn’t being mined by the vendors anyway.  We are in a gold rush and they have 12 foot erections for data.\n\nI have had multiple clients outright ban the use of these tools and likely won’t lift the ban in the foreseeable future.

I dunno that a junior engineer without healthcare experience is going to be vastly better at building a HIPAA-compliant app than Claude is going to be. Both are similarly risky. You just need to make sure you can stand behind the code that you're shipping and the process by which that code got into production. If you're just YOLO-ing code into production you don't understand, you're just going to cause yourself headaches down the line. The size of those headaches though could be... considerable.",
