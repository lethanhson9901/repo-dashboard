      "text": "Hey r/ChatGPTCoding  👋\n\nWe’re a small team of devs from Qoder. With the mods’ permission, we thought it’d be fun (and useful) to do an AMA here.\n\nA few weeks ago,we used our own autonomous agent (Quest) to refactor itself. We described the goal, stepped back, and let it run. It worked through the interaction layer, state management, and the core agent loop continuously, for about 26 hours. We mostly just reviewed the spec at the start and the code at the end. We’ve made good progress, and would like to talk openly about what worked, what broke, and what surprised us.\n\n# What we’re happy to chat about:\n\nHow that 26-hour run actually went\n\nOur spec to build to verify loops, and why we think they matter for autonomous coding\n\nVibe coding, agent workflows, or anything else you’re experimenting with\n\nOr honestly… anything you’re curious about\n\nTechnical deep dives welcome.\n\n# Who’s here:\n\nMian (u/Qoder\\_shimian): Tech lead (agent + systems)\n\nJoshua (u/Own-Traffic-9336) :Tech lead (agent execution)\n\nKarina (u/Even-Entertainer4153) : PM\n\nNathan (u/ZealousidealDraw5987) : PM\n\nBen (u/Previous\\_Foot\\_5328) : Support\n\n# Small thank-you:\n\nEveryone who joins the AMA gets a [2-Week Pro Trial](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama) with Some Credits to try Quest if you want to poke at it yourself.\n\nOur Product: [Qoder.com](https://go.partnerly.us/qoderama)\n\nOur Community: r/Qoder\n\nWe’ll be around on this Tuesday to Friday reading everything and replying as much as we can.",

      "text": "I’ve been watching the whole Devin conversation fade out over the past year, and honestly, it’s been fascinating. Remember when it first dropped? Everyone was losing their minds saying it was the end of SWE jobs. Now, it's radio silence. It seems more like the idea just evaporated.\n\nThe more I talk to other builders, the more a pattern shows up. Devin didn’t fail because the ambition was wrong. It failed because it aimed at a version of autonomy the current models and tooling can’t support yet. You can’t expect a single system to magically understand your repo, rewrite your backend, run migrations, and ship a product without a ton of human constraints wrapped around it. Everyone in those comment sections was saying the same thing. The vision was cool, but the timing was off.\n\nI tried a bunch of these agents. The promise was full autonomy, but the reality still involves a lot of babysitting. You give it a task, it goes off the rails, you correct it, it sort of gets back on track. Rinse and repeat. It feels less like replacing me and more like having a really fast, sometimes frustrating intern. The whole thing seemed built for a future where LLMs were just way smarter than what we actually have.\n\nWell, let's see how the landscape shifted. Instead of trying to create a replacement engineer, tools started leaning into more realistic strengths. I’ve been testing a bunch of AI dev setups myself. Some are fun for quick demos, some for debugging, some for drafting entire modules.\n\nCursor is doubling down on code editing. Claude is building incredible reasoning chains. DeepSeek is pushing raw speed and cost efficiency. It feels less like one tool needs to do everything and more like people are building proper workflows again. Atoms, a tool that’s been emerging, leans into a multi-agent structure instead of pretending a single model can hold everything in its head. It still needs direction. You still have to review decisions. But the team-style setup makes the output a lot more predictable than relying on one giant agent that tries to guess everything.\n\nI don’t mean Claude, Atoms, or anyone else has solved the full autonomy thing. We’re not there yet and probably won’t be for a while. But compared to the Devin approach of give it your repo and pray, the newer tools feel like they’re figuring out how to work with humans rather than replace them.\n\nThe future probably isn’t a single agent doing the whole job. It’s systems that break the problem into parts and communicate what they’re doing, instead of silently rewriting your app.\n\nHas your stack changed since the Devin wave, or did you stick with whatever you were using before? What actually moved the needle for you, if anything? What’s been working for you in the long run?",

I've tried out Jules with a pro subscription, but it just doesn't really give me any value (a lot of the automated tasks just returns garbage); although I suspect that it has more to do with Gemini than the stack itself, like I pay for ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini/Windsurf, but I usually just use all the credits on Claude models anyways (in AntiGravity and WS). Maybe if Anthropic makes a Jules like product, we can see something closer to Devin.\n\nI'm also wondering if we'll ever see a consumer facing (I'm including hobby/power users as well) product that does what Devin does. If someone actually has a predictable autonomous coding stack, it would likely be kept internal by the companies that develop it to create their own coding products to sell. Like if you could turn mercury into gold, you wouldn't sell the process, you'd sell the gold.",

It seems that you can have a Devin-light version today but you need an organization that's very AI - friendly in how the whole tech stack is set up plus a lot of tweaking and setting up to get it to that level.\n\nTheres Claude skill/plugins like compound engineering and Superpowers that are touching at this.

We either have autonomous SWEs, or we don't. The implication here is an explicit conversion between energy/compute to a production ready software product. I don't think these fully automated dev environments can even produce MVPs without significant human interaction.\n\nI often compare the promises of AGI to the promises of FSD in vehicles. We've been promised FSD for basically a decade now (Tesla FSD could be pre-ordered back in 2016), but the progress towards it is still ever improving, but never accomplishing it. Even if FSD works in 99% of the situation, that's still not road safe.",
