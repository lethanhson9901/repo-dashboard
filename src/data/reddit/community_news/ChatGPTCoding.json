PRs are up, deploys are up, and the operational side hasn't scaled to match. I've been tinkering with the idea of building a more specialized tool to help teams maintain their stuff, because I don't see how small teams handle a 10x workload without something changing on the ops side.\n\nI also think the world is shifting hard toward building over buying. If AI can generate code faster than teams can review and operate it, the bottleneck isn't writing software anymore. It's keeping it running.\n\nBut here's where I get stuck. How does anyone actually build anything in this space with fucking Claude and ChatGPT and OpenAI sucking all the air out of the room? Is anyone building specialized tooling, or are we all just watching the foundation model companies fight each other?\n\nWhat the heck are people doing out there? Or we're just doomed to watch Claude on ChatGPT?",

Math does not allow this. \n\nI've been deep (i.e. nearing 6000 hours now) into building a deterministic layer for AI on which the AI is free to be creative and translate intent, while the code itself is written by machine, provably correct through math. It allows us to very literally get away from certain types of technical debt while making the most of AI's ability to translate human intent. \n\nThen we can just speak in outcomes, and code becomes what we want it to be without the nightmare guess and check, extra abstractions, etc. \n\nWhat we're doing right now, dancing for the wild boar, trying to constrain it with words is like the definition of insanity. It's a regression engine in the sense that it'll always regress to the mean, which is patchy and myopic at best. AND we all pay massive sums in API tokens for the privilege.  ",

That is the external boundary line where everything is unknown to us. \n\nWhat we can know is the rest, with 100% fidelity. We map every path that exists, tracking function to function paths across everything within the confines of the codebase. Through multiple passes, it creates a blueprint of the whole thing that is now machine navigable.\n\nThis becomes a twin of your codebase intent, of which we can \"challenge\" AI output against. The AI can not even commit something to the codebase that isn't provably correct structurally, contractually, etc. It doesn't always outright deny, but acts as a sort of conical docking mechanism where the AI can be a bit off (i.e. use cheaper models), and the intent is preserved and understood regardless, either ultimately allowing or denying that mutation. \n\nIt's being built predominantly to solve the day 2 problem of coding, legacy codebase management. Yesterday for example we successfully proofed the ability to deterministically refactor. We took an intentionally difficult monolith file with 20 or so functions in it, mixed state, etc and refactored it into 22 clean files. The existing file name remains (so nothing upstream changes), shared elements moved to a \\_shared file and that along with the 20 individual functions separated into their own clean files wrapped in a folder named the same as the original file. 0 LLMs. Functionally identical output before and after.   \n  \nIf AI can run on a deterministic chessboard like this, we don't need the flagship models either, we don't need to chase POWER, we can chase applied use of the existing models through architecture that ensures correctness. If this works for code, it could arguably be applied to other specialties with their own 'world rules'. \n\n",

If you wrote thousands of lines of code, and then did one test you would probably not hit anywhere near a 98% success rate.\n\nThe way to be sure is the same as it's always been - humans also can't be sure just by writing code.

If AI can generate code faster than teams can review and operate it, the bottleneck isn't writing software anymore.

The barrier to entry for building software-for-one or a bespoke stack has never been lower.\n\nThink of the ocean of point-based software (shopify plugins, specialized CRM things, BI ETL things)... what value do they deliver if it's now more accessible than ever for orgs or small biz's to build what they need specifically for their needs, vs buy from the fragmented glut of 'close enough' SaaS stuff? \n\nEven a medium sized org has like a minimum of 30 different SaaS line items; wouldn't they be incentivized cut cost & vendor dependancy by building vs buying more? I'm not saying business would vibe their own Excel, but I am betting a lot of middleware is at risk. I'd be really nervous to be a shopify/wordpress plugin dev these days.\n\nI do agree with the \"challenge in keeping it running\" point -- but I'm not sure I agree that the implied solution = pay for more SaaS support to manage.

Weekly limits should be roughly the tokens needed for a single day of programming. I don't think I'll ever switch away from Codex at this point, and that's because I was able to use it for several days of actual work and some evenings on my personal projects before I hit the weekly limit.

The project is called **WFGY 3.0 · Tension Universe**. It started as a 16-problem RAG failure map for engineers (now used in a few AI / RAG projects), and 3.0 is the “story layer” on top: 131 S-class tension questions that act like a candidate *new science* for how worlds break, heal, or transform.\n\nFor writers, you can treat it as a **tension-first sci-fi engine**:\n\n* pick one or two of the 131 questions (e.g. “what happens when a whole civilization keeps the wrong tension ledger?”)\n* ask your model to use the TXT as its “tension physics textbook”\n* let it first explain the tension geometry (who pays the cost, where the pressure moves), then build characters, factions, and plot around that\n\nThe whole thing is MIT-licensed and lives in a single human-readable TXT pack, so you can:\n\n* use it as a prompt-bundle / system prompt for AI writing\n* or just read the questions and use them as a personal sci-fi idea atlas, without AI at all\n\nI’m especially looking for feedback from writers on:\n\n* which kinds of tension questions are most inspiring for actual stories\n* where the “tension science” is too abstract or needs more concrete language\n* what kind of companion docs or examples (story seeds, arcs, world templates) would make this genuinely useful in your workflow\n\nRepo (with TXT pack + docs): 👉 [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY)\n\nIf you try it with your own AI writing setup and hit something interesting (or broken), I’d really love to hear what happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqutgl0l4glg1.png?width=4955&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec81542ea7df45356eed3d0cbc664d7747fe9eba\n\n",

And I imagined there are scenarios you are traveling with your phone and laptop, you may want to game on either one, but you don't want to bring two controllers, one for the phone and one for laptop. You could just bring the more-compact phone controller, and somehow use it as the controller for your laptop. The phone wouldn't be streaming the video from your PC (doesn't need to display anything really), but instead just act like an emulated xinput device. Does that make sense?

You know exactly why a prospect needs you before reaching out - then AI writes the outreach for you.\n\nVS the alternatives: Apollo/Clay cost $350+/month and aren’t built for local. We start at $10/month.\n\nTarget user: Freelancers and small agencies who want smart prospecting without enterprise pricing.\n\nTraction: Just launched. First users onboarding now.\n\nBiggest blocker: Getting in front of the right freelancers at scale.\n\nHappy to answer questions!",

Importantly: that's not a criticism of the capability... it's almost exclusively the fact that I simply don't have the correctly scoped problem/context/clearly desired result. Because most tasks aren't that usage.\n\nOf the times it worked best: i spent perhaps 3hrs defining the problem statement, priming context to the model, and thinking hard myself about what I wanted the output to acheive. Literally majority of my day would be spent prepping for one or two 10-minute queries! That's the mindset you need to approach pro-mode with if you want a good result... but it'll still happily heat up a data center based on a lazy one-shot task before probably timing out, lol!\n\nOf the majority of \"bad results\" -- it was usually me throwing a poorly defined problem at it, or myself not understanding the problem space enough to know what I even wanted the task to be.",
