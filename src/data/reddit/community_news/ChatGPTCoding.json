Is a subscription going to get me that, or do i need to pay for API or what?\n\n  \nCan I still have claude code, but let chatgpt do the coding tasks?

It has several steps, but is pretty awesome and worth it, in my opinion.\n\nFirst, if you aren’t set up with it already, then set up an account with OpenRouter. It will let you switch between a wide variety of models with a single AI code companion. NOTE: You will still have to configure your OpenRouter account with API keys from each LLM provider (i.e. you need to connect your OpenRouter to your OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. accounts).\n\nIf you aren’t using it already, install VSCode, then install either the GitHub Copilot Chat extension or the Roo Code extension.\n\nOpen either the GitHub Copilot Chat or the Roo Code extension and then you can play around with the list of models you have available. And with Roo Code, you can even configure it so when it’s doing a specific type of work in a task, to use a specific model. So like I have it using GPT 5.2 Codex for looking through the code, debugging, and coding itself. But then when it does something like write documentation or an implementation plan for me, it automatically uses Sonnet 4.5\n\nI know it sounds like a lot. But it’s not too bad. Once you are set up, you will be insanely productive. DM me if you need help or have any questions",

Claude wants to make a more compact, more ergonomic code, ChatGPT/Codex tends to modularize sometimes to the extreme, sometimes to make giant modules, 10k lines, which is not healthy for debugging and changes.\n\nChatGPT (in chat) often makes mistakes in larger projects, repeating tasks for a parenthesis, a comma, etc. Codex, on the other hand, is safer, and additionally it can use the tools provided, autodebug, perform self-tests, take screenshots, mouse clicks on the interface, etc.\n\nThe ChatGPT bonus in Chat is \"free\", you don't use up your limits/tokens, while Claude, with a single prompt and a 3-10 minute answer you can use up the 5 hour limit, absurd. If you want to continue, you can add credit, yes it is excessively expensive for what it offers, compared to CgahtGPT.

If AI can generate code faster than teams can review and operate it, the bottleneck isn't writing software anymore. It's keeping it running.\n\nBut here's where I get stuck. How does anyone actually build anything in this space with fucking Claude and ChatGPT and OpenAI sucking all the air out of the room?

That is the external boundary line where everything is unknown to us. \n\nWhat we can know is the rest, with 100% fidelity. We map every path that exists, tracking function to function paths across everything within the confines of the codebase. Through multiple passes, it creates a blueprint of the whole thing that is now machine navigable.\n\nThis becomes a twin of your codebase intent, of which we can \"challenge\" AI output against. The AI can not even commit something to the codebase that isn't provably correct structurally, contractually, etc. It doesn't always outright deny, but acts as a sort of conical docking mechanism where the AI can be a bit off (i.e. use cheaper models), and the intent is preserved and understood regardless, either ultimately allowing or denying that mutation. \n\nIt's being built predominantly to solve the day 2 problem of coding, legacy codebase management. Yesterday for example we successfully proofed the ability to deterministically refactor. We took an intentionally difficult monolith file with 20 or so functions in it, mixed state, etc and refactored it into 22 clean files. The existing file name remains (so nothing upstream changes), shared elements moved to a \\_shared file and that along with the 20 individual functions separated into their own clean files wrapped in a folder named the same as the original file. 0 LLMs. Functionally identical output before and after.   \n  \nIf AI can run on a deterministic chessboard like this, we don't need the flagship models either, we don't need to chase POWER, we can chase applied use of the existing models through architecture that ensures correctness. If this works for code, it could arguably be applied to other specialties with their own 'world rules'. \n\n",

If you wrote thousands of lines of code, and then did one test you would probably not hit anywhere near a 98% success rate.\n\nThe way to be sure is the same as it's always been - humans also can't be sure just by writing code.

The project is called **WFGY 3.0 · Tension Universe**. It started as a 16-problem RAG failure map for engineers (now used in a few AI / RAG projects), and 3.0 is the “story layer” on top: 131 S-class tension questions that act like a candidate *new science* for how worlds break, heal, or transform.\n\nFor writers, you can treat it as a **tension-first sci-fi engine**:\n\n* pick one or two of the 131 questions (e.g. “what happens when a whole civilization keeps the wrong tension ledger?”)\n* ask your model to use the TXT as its “tension physics textbook”\n* let it first explain the tension geometry (who pays the cost, where the pressure moves), then build characters, factions, and plot around that\n\nThe whole thing is MIT-licensed and lives in a single human-readable TXT pack, so you can:\n\n* use it as a prompt-bundle / system prompt for AI writing\n* or just read the questions and use them as a personal sci-fi idea atlas, without AI at all\n\nI’m especially looking for feedback from writers on:\n\n* which kinds of tension questions are most inspiring for actual stories\n* where the “tension science” is too abstract or needs more concrete language\n* what kind of companion docs or examples (story seeds, arcs, world templates) would make this genuinely useful in your workflow\n\nRepo (with TXT pack + docs): 👉 [https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY)\n\nIf you try it with your own AI writing setup and hit something interesting (or broken), I’d really love to hear what happens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqutgl0l4glg1.png?width=4955&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec81542ea7df45356eed3d0cbc664d7747fe9eba\n\n",

I had a similar idea I'll throw out there but it could be out of scope for your project. \n\nI have a telescoping game pad for my phone; ie, makes it like a steamdeck/switch, but it's connected via USB C to the phone, not Bluetooth. And I imagined there are scenarios you are traveling with your phone and laptop, you may want to game on either one, but you don't want to bring two controllers, one for the phone and one for laptop. You could just bring the more-compact phone controller, and somehow use it as the controller for your laptop. The phone wouldn't be streaming the video from your PC (doesn't need to display anything really), but instead just act like an emulated xinput device. Does that make sense? Sticking to LAN, the latency might not be too bad either.",

I’ve been using AC⚡DC as a **\"High-Speed Wedge\"** in my workflow:\n\n1. **Code fast with AC⚡DC** for 90% of the work (UI is a webapp with Monaco/side-by-side diffs, so it feels fluid).\n2. **Use a slower agent** only when I hit a logic wall that needs agentic work.\n3. **Jump back to AC⚡DC** to keep the momentum.\n\n**Technical highlights:**\n\n* **4-Tier Prompt Caching (L0-L3):** Designed to hit provider-level cache breakpoints (like Anthropic’s) so you aren't paying to re-ingest your repo every time you send a message.\n* **Structural Context:** Uses Tree-sitter (Py, JS/TS, C++) to give the LLM a symbol map of the repo without wasting tokens on full-file boilerplate.\n* **Code Review Mode:** A dedicated UI to pick a commit, soft-reset, and have the LLM walk through the changes with you before they land.\n\n**Looking for feedback:**\n\nI’ve dogfooded this almost entirely on Linux. I’ve included standalone binaries for **macOS** and **Windows** in the release, but I’m curious to hear from Mac/PC users if the webapp boots and connects properly on those systems.\n\n**Repo & Demo Videos:** [https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder](https://github.com/flatmax/AI-Coder-DeCoder)\n\nIt’s free/open-source. Happy to answer any questions about the caching or indexing logic!",
