I'm trying to decide if it's worth switching from Copilot. It's twice as much, but it offers significantly more usage for that price and I think it's a better agent.\n\nI'm pretty frugal. My only other AI expense is Open Router which I use the really cheap or free models from a lot. I put $10 in 7 months ago and I'm just a bit over 50% through it and I've used it quite a bit.",

Cursor is my favourite IDE experience and the grandfathered pricing means I can have it perform long, sessions if I am very clear in what I'm asking for. Cursor to me has the best dev experience because I like to see what changes where made and I often edit - $20 pm for 500 completions.\n\n2. Claude Code. I typically use this to plan, ask questions, refactor etc. I will use CC until I hit my session limit and then I switch to another tool. CC is my primary driver,    - $20pm for CC's intermittent sessions.\n\n3. OpenCode - This is my only pay on demand experience. I use ZEN. I like that I know exactly how much things cost. I use this sparingly when I'm in a bind. The monthly price here varies but I never feel ripped off. I think the rightway to use open code is to consciously switch models depending on where you are. - \\~20pm for basically unlimited bad models with 1/2 opus sessions if I need planning\n\n4. Kiro - A great tool, chronically underrated. It's underrated because SPEC driven dev while a great idea doesn't really work autonomously. I find the design specs that build user journey most helpful. That said I almost always stay in their \"vibe\" mode. And just have the model build a plan via markdown. It's fast, and the tooling uses the models more efficiently than cursor. I don't think any tool gives you more out of their credits than kiro - $15pm for 500 credits (note 1 completion != 1 credit)\n\nCopilot and Antigravity are notable highlights. Haven't used copilot in a while but I hear that it doesn't suck anymore. And when I used antigravity I thought it was great but didn't incorporate it into my workflow because I didn't understand the pricing and usage patterns. \n\nEnd result for about $75pm I have near constant access to SOTA models. I like my workflow because by having an intelligent mix these tools all cover up the others shortcomings. I'm also exposed to different tooling ideas and i know what works in different situations.",

      "text": "Hi again. Whether you’re building tools for internal use, side projects, open-source utilities, or commercial products, understanding how monetization and incentive structures affect your design decisions is increasingly important.  \n  \nOne of the dynamics we’ve observed in agent ecosystems is that monetization opportunities change how builders approach architecture, documentation, and user experience. A few patterns stand out:  \n  \nRewarding adoption shapes development priorities. When there are clear incentives for usage, builders naturally focus on reliability, onboarding experience, and developer experience because these directly affect real interactions. This aligns agent goals with real user behavior rather than internal benchmarks.  \n  \nStructured incentive programs can sharpen your product thinking. Programs that reward adoption, quality, or showcase contributions give you measurable goals beyond toy demos. These can include cash rewards, leaderboard competitions, featured placements, or tiered bonus systems tied to usage and retention.  \n  \nExposure and product feedback loops accelerate iteration. When platform incentives prioritize visibility for certain agent types or quality factors, builders get real world signals that guide improvements. These signals retention, conversions, usage patterns help you refine both technical quality and product fit.  \n  \nIn one incentive program we reviewed, publishing a “featured agent” with a strong description, quality implementation, and clear user value earned a direct bonus plus additional visibility across marketplace surfaces. This directly rewards not just technical execution but also clarity of purpose and user-centric design.  \n  \nFrom a coding perspective, this affects how you prioritize:  \n\\- Error resilience and instrumentation  \n\\- UX around prompts and interactivity  \n\\- Onboarding flows for your agent  \n\\- Monitoring and metrics collection  \n  \nSuddenly, things like structured logging, test harnesses, rollback strategies, and even pricing strategies become technical decisions, not just product ones.  \n  \nAnother pattern we’re seeing is community-level incentives. These reward knowledge sharing, tutorials, troubleshooting guides, and ecosystem support all of which make the agent ecosystem more vibrant, and help developers learn from each other faster.  \n  \nFrom a practical standpoint, thinking about monetization earlier in the build process changes your code structure. For example:  \n  \nYou might design your API handlers to support usage counts or rate tiers.  \nYou might instrument more detailed usage metrics.  \nYou might write more modular task handlers so that high usage components can scale independently.  \n  \nAll of these are technical decisions you’d make anyway but are often delayed because the initial focus is just “get it working.”  \n  \nWe’re sharing this because the future of agents isn’t only about what you can build it’s also about how your code gets used, evaluated, and sustained. Incentives and monetization frameworks add another layer of rigor that can improve your code, not just your revenue.  \n  \n**We’d love to hear from the community:**  \nWhen you think about putting a price tag or usage meter on an agent, what concerns do you have? Are there technical gaps you’re unsure how to bridge metrics, pricing logic, billing hooks, scale considerations, webhook architecture?  \n  \nLooking forward to the discussion.",

I had zero knowledge of programming, but eventually decided I had to build it myself, with a lot of help from Claude and ChatGPT.\n\nI built a prototype in little more than a month, which can be found on [Github](https://github.com/StandieControls/BetterJoyMotion) and seen on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_1GiqGPq4o).

Save your test cases in a CSV, run your prompt against all of them at once, see outputs side-by-side inside VS code. When you're testing against 5-10 scenarios instead of 1, you catch regressions before they hit prod.\n\n**The problem:** You spend hours perfecting a prompt. It handles your test case beautifully. You ship it. Two hours later, it fails on some edge cases you never tested. Now you're debugging, rolling things back, and scrambling to figure out which change broke what.\n\n**What Mind Rig does:** It lets you test AI prompts directly inside VS Code with your actual data structures. You can test against multiple different models, run them all at once, and compare outputs side-by-side. No setup—just install the extension and connect your Vercel AI Gateway keys.\n\n**Why it matters:** Stop shipping prompts that break on edge cases. Stop wasting 6+ hours/week context-switching. Build systematic testing into your workflow without slowing down.\n\nCompletely free and open source. Works with Claude, GPT-4, and any model supported by Vercel AI Gateway.\n\nWould love feedback from anyone building AI features.\n\nDownload Link: [https://mindrig.ai](https://mindrig.ai)",

      "text": "**What it is**\n\nNikolytics Radio is a late-night jazz station for founders who work too late. 3-hour YouTube videos. AI-generated jazz. A tired DJ named Sonny Nix who checks in between tracks with deadpan observations about your inbox, your pipeline, and why that proposal is still sitting in drafts.\n\nFive volumes in five days. 70+ subscribers. 14k views on the first Reddit post.\n\nIt’s a passion project that doubles as marketing for my automation consultancy.\n\n-----\n\n**The concept**\n\nThe pitch: You’re at your desk at 3 AM. Everyone’s asleep. You put on Nikolytics Radio. A weathered voice observes your situation with dark humor. He’s been where you are. He doesn’t fix it. He just… sees it. Then plays a record.\n\nThe DJ (Sonny Nix) is a former founder who burned out and now plays jazz for strangers. He has recurring “listeners” who write in: Todd from Accounting whose job got automated, Margaret from Operations who finished her task list and doesn’t know what to do with herself.\n\nIt’s 95% vibe, 5% branding. If you removed every mention of my business, the station would still work. That’s the point.\n\n-----\n\n**The tech stack**\n\n**Music generation:** Suno\n\nI wrote 49 artist-specific prompts optimized for deep work. Each prompt targets a specific jazz style piano trio, cool trumpet, tenor ballad, etc. Settings: Instrumental only, ~3-4 min tracks, specific mood tags.\n\nExample prompt structure:\n\n```\njazz, 1950s late-night jazz combo: brushed kit, upright bass walking gently, \nwarm felted piano carrying the main theme, soft brass pads... \n[mood tags: soft, warm, slow, lounge, nostalgic]\n```\n\nGenerate 3-4 per prompt, pick the best, discard anything too busy or with abrupt endings.\n\n**Voice generation:** ElevenLabs\n\nCustom voice clone for Sonny Nix. I use their V3 model with specific audio tags:\n\n- `[mischievously]` - dry humor, irony\n- `[whispers]` - punchlines, gut punches\n- `[sighs]` - weariness\n- `[excited]` - mock ads only (ironic use)\n- `...` - pauses\n\nV3 doesn’t support some tags like [warm] or [tired], so the *words* have to carry the emotion. Write tired sentences. Sorrowful observations.\n\n**Script writing:** txt\n\nI mostly write the scripts, claude double checks for optimizations\n\n**Assembly:** Logic Pro\n\n120 BPM grid. Drop the tracks, drop the voice clips. Crossfade. Each episode is ~30 drops across 3 hours. Export as MP3.\n\n**Video:** FFmpeg\n\nStatic image + audio. One command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage \n-c:a aac -b:a 320k -shortest output.mp4\n```\n\n-----\n\n**The writing system**\n\nEach episode has 30 “drops” — short DJ segments between songs:\n\n- **Station IDs** - Quick brand hits (“Nikolytics Radio… still here.”)\n- **Bumpers** - One-liners (“The coffee’s cold. You noticed an hour ago. Still drinking it.”)\n- **Pain points** - Observations that hit too close (“Revision eight. The scope tripled. The budget didn’t.”)\n- **Testimonials** - Fictional listeners writing in\n- **Mock ads** - Parody sponsor segments (“Introducing Scope Creep Insurance…”)\n- **Dedications** - “This one goes out to everyone who almost quit today…”\n- **Recurring segments** - Pipeline Weather, Outreach Report, Inbox Conditions\n\nThe key insight: Sonny has emotional range. He’s not monotone. He moves between tired, mischievous, sorrowful. He worries about Todd. He offers brief sympathy to Sarah. Then plays a record.\n\n-----\n\n**What worked**\n\n1. **The vibe is the moat.** Most automation consultants are boring. This is different enough that people share it.\n2. **Worldbuilding compounds.** Todd’s promotion arc. Margaret’s puzzle. Callbacks like “Here it’s always 3 AM.” Returning listeners feel like regulars.\n3. **Reddit got it started.** First post on r/productivity got 14k views. Someone called it “Slop Radio FM.” Now that’s a badge of honor we reference in the show.\n4. **Daily uploads built momentum.** Five volumes in five days. The algorithm likes consistency.\n\n-----\n\n**What I learned about AI voice**\n\n- ElevenLabs V3 is good but literal. It interprets quotes as character voices (breaks everything). Always paraphrase.\n- Tags only work if the model supports them. No [warm], no [tired]. The text has to do the work.\n- Regenerate 2-3x per drop, pick the best take. Same script, different reads.\n- Punchlines land in `[whispers]`. Setup is `[mischievously]`. Then stop — no extra lines after the joke lands.\n\n-----\n\n**Time investment**\n\n- Initial setup (prompts, character docs, templates): ~15 hours\n- Per episode now: ~2 hours\n  - Generate music: 30 min\n  - Generate voice drops: 30 min\n  - Assembly in Logic: 30 min\n  - YouTube upload + description: 30 min\n\n**What could be automated further**\n\n- **Voice generation** - Currently pasting drops one by one into ElevenLabs. Could batch via API.\n- **Timestamps** - Calculating from bar positions manually. Already wrote a Python script, could integrate it.\n- **YouTube description** - Template exists, still copy-pasting. Easy n8n automation.\n- **Episode assembly** - The real bottleneck. Logic Pro is manual drag-and-drop. Exploring scripted alternatives.\n\nWriting stays mine. \n\nThe dream: one-click episode generation. Not there yet, but the pieces exist.\n\n\n-----\n\n**Link**\n\n- YouTube: https://youtube.com/@nikolyticsradio?si=xrFpLfRKRAsZqv_B\n\nHappy to answer questions about the workflow, the writing system, or the Suno/ElevenLabs settings.\n\n-----\n\n**TL;DR:** Built a fake radio station with AI music (Suno), AI voice (ElevenLabs), and my scripts. The DJ has a character bible. There’s lore. It’s marketing for my automation business but also just… a thing that exists now. 70 subscribers in 5 days.",

When I started my bachelor's in 2021, there was basically no AI to ask for help, especially for coding tasks. I remmber having to fight with the compiler just to get enough points to be admitted to the exams.\n\nWhen ChatGPT first came out (3.5), I tried using it for things like database schemas, but honestly, it wasn't that helpful for me back then. But 2025 feels completely different. I've talked to students in lower semesters, and they say it's a total game-changer. I've even heard that the dedicated tutoring rooms on campus are alsmost empty now because everyone uses AI.\n\nI'm currently writing my thesis on this topic. I’d love to hear your thoughts. Is AI a \"tutor\" for you, or do you feel it creates a dependency?",

          "text": "It’s been a game changer for me personally. I was in my DSA class (a weed out/breakpoint class for the degree where many students changed degrees after failing) the first time before chatGPT and I was utterly and completely lost. I got a C in that class and had to retake it (a C is failing that particular class). That summer chatGPT came out and my programming partner showed it to me. Even the early version was really helpful at explaining things and could solve the problems for us. \n\nFast forward to now and I’m using cursor (an AI IDE) to write tests for my senior projects backend. I know what it can and can’t do. It’s great for writing tests and documentation and prototyping, but for core functionality production code it’s best if I write it myself. Cursor has tab completion that helps with stuff but yeah I have to be careful about how much I let the agents do because not only does it potentially circumvent deep learning, but being unfamiliar with my own codebase can cause problems with my own ability to debug if I don’t understand what’s going on.\n\nOne underrated aspect of LLMs is their ability to use tools in ways I didn’t know were possible, such as Linux commands and tools I don’t really use. Then later I can try those things myself. But yeah the risk is always present that one may lose deep knowledge in return for code that is functional but unreliable. But the LLMs can help me learn stacks and tools I don’t use by providing suggestions and pointing me to real human sources of info.\n\nI personally though have a love/hate relationship with it generally. I hate how much proprietary art it’s stolen. I hate how it’s affected the creative industry. I hate how it’s affected the programming industry because I can’t find a job. \n\nBut at least I have an idea of how to develop an app well enough to turn it into a business now so that’s cool. It’s hard to say if that would be the case without LLMs but yeah that’s where I’m at. I feel confident to know that I have a tool that will help me but have mixed feelings about it overall.\n\nFeel free to dm me if you have further questions!",

For example, when I recently needed to create a simple endpoint with a Python backend, I immediately felt the urge to ask ChatGPT. Even though I knew almost everything about the task, and if I didn't, I could have just skimmed the docs in a couple of minutes.\n\nIt feels like I'm becoming more and more dependent on AI, and I'm not sure if I can actually do things faster by just reading the docs anymore.\n\nBtw, I currently have 1 responses for my survey. I would greatly appreciate it if you would be a collaborator: [https://forms.gle/2Hy3FdQ45Gdxkc1e8](https://forms.gle/2Hy3FdQ45Gdxkc1e8)",

When you say “collaborator”, did you just want me to take the survey? Or help you run it?\n\nI think it’s just a question of what you feel is worth your time. Is being able to write a python endpoint from scratch with little to no help important to you? Would it be even better to do so without a linter and no referential documentation? Is it *that* important to you to know Python syntax?\n\nOr perhaps you feel like you know it well enough to write it from scratch. If so, could you really? Could you change it to fit some other specifications easily? \n\nPersonally, programming is often a slew of languages and tools. It’s overwhelming and kind of impossible to know it all. If I did Python APIs for a job I feel like I’d want to make sure I could write something out for this on literal paper with no tools. But if it’s a one off thing like you know having this done is more important than knowing in detail how it’s written (things like unit tests fall into this category for me) then I think it’s worth offloading to an LLM",

But if you use them as a partner that knows about the same as you it might work better. If you use them, do so for iterating on your own thoughts.

      "text": "Hi everyone. We’re the MuleRun team, sharing this openly as a brand and as fellow builders in the agent ecosystem.\n\nOver the past year, we’ve been deeply immersed in how developers, coders, and domain experts build AI agents. What we repeatedly see is a familiar tradeoff in today’s tooling: low-code workflow builders are easy to start with but quickly hit capability ceilings, while code-first frameworks are powerful but come with steep engineering overhead. \n\nThis tension matters because the way we build agents shapes what we can deliver to users. When the development path itself becomes a barrier, great ideas stay stuck in prototypes.\n\nWe think there’s a practical pivot point emerging, one that’s especially relevant to this community: agents are no longer just “a bunch of prompts stitched together,” nor should they require heavy engineering frameworks just to be functional. Instead, the future of agent construction is shaped by a new paradigm that combines:\n\n* A Base Agent core that handles reasoning, planning, and task orchestration\n* Knowledge that guides it on domain tasks\n* Tools that give it capabilities like browsing, file interaction, or calculations\n* A Runtime that executes the agent reliably in production\n\nThis pattern Base Agent + Knowledge + Tools + Runtime is becoming a de facto way to think about real, production-ready agents rather than DIY hacks or rigid frameworks. \n\nWhat’s interesting for developers is how much this lowers both the entry barrier and raises the capability ceiling. Instead of choosing between a limited low-code tool or a full framework, this paradigm lets you treat natural language and code as first-class building blocks. You describe what you want at a high level, and the system maps that into a capable agent that can:\n\n* Plan multi-step actions\n* Call rich tools like browsers or databases\n* Use structured domain knowledge\n* Scale beyond simple chat loops\n\nThat doesn’t mean code goes away. On the contrary, coders can continue to define custom skills, integrate specialized libraries, and refine behavior but without managing every infrastructure detail from scratch.\n\nWe’re working on a tool that embodies this approach, and it will enter early preview soon. The idea is to let builders focus on what the agent should do, not on how to wire tools and runtimes together manually. This is especially useful if you’ve ever abandoned a promising project because your toolchain couldn’t scale, or an SDK was too complex to integrate. \n\n**In practice, this means:**\n\n* You describe what the agent needs to accomplish in natural language\n* The builder interprets that intent and configures the underlying agent core\n* Skills, tools, and knowledge components are assembled automatically\n* You get an agent that can reason, act, and be iterated on without wrestling boilerplate or glue code\n\nFor those of you who are already mixing code with LLM prompts and tool integrations, this shift matters because it lets you treat natural language as part of the development process, not just a layer for users.\n\nWe’re excited to hear from this community:\n\nWhat parts of your agent building workflow feel hardest right now tooling, abstraction, error recovery, or production readiness? What would make your next agent project easier or more powerful?",

MuleRun’s approach with Base Agent + Knowledge + Tools + Runtime is designed to handle the tricky parts, like error handling and edge cases, behind the scenes.\n\nOur upcoming Mule Agent Builder specifically focuses on keeping agents reliable in production while still letting creators define what the agent should do using natural language. It handles the plumbing automatically planning, reasoning, tool integration  so you can focus on the agent’s behavior and capabilities. Tools for simplifying error recovery and production stability are a big part of what we’re building, and we’re excited to see how this lowers the barrier while raising the capability ceiling.\n\nCurious what types of edge cases or reliability issues have been the most painful in your projects so far?",

      "text": "I know LLMs have context-window and performance limits. I also get the common advice: *start a new chat when the history gets too long*. Totally reasonable from a model perspective.\n\nBut from a **UX perspective**, this is where it breaks for me.\n\nWhenever a chat reaches a pretty long history, the **ChatGPT interface itself becomes impossible to use**:\n\n* Typing freezes mid-sentence, lags between lines, and backspace takes seconds to register\n* The entire UI occasionally locks up completely\n* Selecting text to copy is either extremely slow or not possible at all\n* The page becomes unresponsive while typing or editing prompts\n* It sometimes freezes so hard that the model never even responds\n\nWhat shocked me the most — the chat shown in the attached video froze completely and **never recovered**. It didn’t even generate an answer to my last prompt. That’s the first time I’ve seen it fully die like that. Usually it freezes for a long time, then eventually comes back with a response.\n\nOther LLM platforms handle long chat histories far better. They might slow down, but they don’t **freeze, lag, or become totally unusable**. Some sites even handle very long chats smoothly with no noticeable interface issues.\n\nI honestly can’t believe I’m the only one going through this stress.  \n**Why is nobody talking about it?**\n\nAgain — I’m not complaining about the model’s limitations. I’m complaining that the **UI experience becomes stressful and broken**, and I genuinely believe this is **not the level of UX users deserve**.\n\nHas anyone else faced this behavior?  \nOr is my browser/OS cursed?\n\n(For context, I’m using ChatGPT Plus in a desktop browser, and the video attached is a screen recording of the issue happening in real time.)\n\nWould love to hear if others have seen this too.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q1rtg3/video/7pi7w48rvvag1/player",

A chrome tab (or any Chromium based browser) has a hard memory limit of 2 GB per tab, as the chat goes on the memory fills up due to stuff like attachments being kept in memory for you to access by just scrolling up all the way to the start of the chat. Eventually it'll fill up and starts becoming insanely slow, even occasionally crashing despite your computer having plenty of RAM left. So any time you open a new chat, that's all cleared from memory and suddenly everything is back to being smooth.\n\nI tried using the \"native\" windows chatgpt app as a workaround but that's even worse somehow. \n\nGemini doesn't seem to suffer from this issue as its built inherently different from what I understand.

          "text": "> ChatGPT UI becomes unusable in long chats. Am I really the only one?\n\nThis is a common issue.  As a general rule, to achieve higher quality outputs and responses, you should keep your conversation threads as short as possible when using any LLM on any platform. Context and token limits prevent them from remembering large amounts of information outside of their training data.\n\nI've been slowly working on a \\[custom\\] branch of [**this project**](https://github.com/revivalstack/ai-chat-exporter) as a .js in [**Violentmonkey**](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey).\n\nIf you look around hard enough, there are various other browser extensions and projects that can do this, too. My custom branch is very spaghetti rn, but it's very helpful for my specific needs.\n\nI frequently export Gemini/GPT/Perplexity, etc. threads as .json/.md when I feel the conversation has become too long and there is a high risk of drift/hallucination occurring as a \"*fix*\" or \"*workaround*\" to it.\n\nIf you feel your responses have degraded on ChatGPT, you can click the \"`...`\" on any of the agent's responses in any conversation and select the \"`branch in new chat`\" option, where you can attach your conversation export(s) and/or any other relevant context, files, information to continue where you left off in the old \"*corrupted*\" or \"*messy*\" conversation(s).\n\nThis can help the agent rebuild your workflow and restore proper context, while improving the chances that your responses are of higher quality and are as you've intended.\n\nProviding prompts that explain your issues is also very helpful; the more accurate and high-quality information you provide to an LLM, the higher the quality of your outputs will be.\n\n# (>!**Garbage in = garbage out**!<).",
