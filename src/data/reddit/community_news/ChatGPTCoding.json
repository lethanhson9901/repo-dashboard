(I can create a custom agent of course but it seems like this is the primary usecase of this default build-in coding agent would be to make such code changes, they claim this was done to encourage intentionality & to avoid run-away implementations, which I am all for but not even suggesting a single code change is far too small a step.  Claude & GPT-5.2-Codex both one-shot this writing \\~1400 new lines & creating multiple files, just seems like a huge step back even if other things about 5.3 were improved…).  >!…This leads to 5.2 implementing wrong assumptions on things that could have easily been clarified by the user or verified with code.  eg. 5.2 made up a giant table of potential API attributes names it would attempt to query when these attributes were already known & it had been given the API swagger documentation with an API call that listed all existing attributes…which I would have expected it to run if it was trying to determine this on its own…not just guess at names that sounded right but to be based in reality even if it needed to create & run a utility script to gain this knowledge.!<\n\nusecase: I was extracting functionality into a separate application where I had working code that I wanted to take specific parts of & simplify them into their own solution.  Provided the existing implementation (4 C# files) & an empty boilerplate C# project with the dependencies & configs already setup in the same way as the last project.  It did not write a single line.  It would talk about what it planned on doing & then stop itself.\n\nProblem with 5.3-Codex:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxd20iw6pekg1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=835ed349346f425df3a81e8fe6e35b2f98c1231a\n\nQ: Why is GPT-5.3-Codex pausing instead of implementing code iteratively?  It made its own Todo & then stopped after the very first action.  GPT-5.2-Codex agent would have worked continuously until it had modified all the files it needed to.\n\nA: [https://chatgpt.com/s/t\\_6996ab2a85a881919a5cb470a26a70be](https://chatgpt.com/s/t_6996ab2a85a881919a5cb470a26a70be)\n\nThis was one Plan up above this & then switching to Agent mode for the rest of the failed chat.",

For example, is one noticeably better at scaffolding while another is better at debugging or refactoring?\n\n**If you’ve mainly settled on one:** How does it stack up against the major incumbents like **Codex** or **Anthropic’s Claude** models?\n\nI’m specifically looking to hear if these newer models offer a distinct advantage or feel different to drive, or if they just feel like \"more of the same.\"\n\nThanks for sharing your insights!",

Lots of hallucinations here and there. Glm was a bit slow but result was good. Kimi in between.\n\nConclusion wasn't generated by me directly. It was Claude and Codex that decided this result, together, weighted. Which means Claude decided the solution generated by codex were better than the opus.\n\nI suggest you try same thing in multiple models, and decide for yourself.

I gave the same prompt to various models in vscode, and currently testing on cursor but I got curious and fed the same prompt to the web based  chat and the code it gave me was much better (functional atleast).\n\nI am going to complete the test for the most part but since the LLM's are more or less the same across IDE's i dont know how different the results will be.\n\nLogicially it makes sense I guess because  IDE's are mostly going for speed/productivity so they dont think quite as long as web.   \n  \n I guess the real modern workflow will be using the agent for boiler plate code, changes to an existing system and using the web/desktop flow to create the initial boiler plate for large systems and just over all planning.   \n  \nFor reference im a game dev the prompt was to make a simple spawn a list of objects into rows and columns flat on the ground using their bounding boxes.",

I'd get an idea for an app, open Cursor, type something like \"build me a task management app with a clean UI\" and then spend the next 3 hours fighting the AI because it picked some random stack, invented features I didn't ask for, and made everything look like a Bootstrap template from 2019.\n\nThe problem wasn't the coding agent. It was me. I was giving it garbage specs.\n\nSo over the past couple weeks I built this thing I'm calling Vibe Architect. It's basically a structured brainstorming tool where an AI architect proposes stuff and you just say yes/no/change this. You don't have to come up with anything from scratch.\n\nIt goes through phases:\n\nFirst it figures out your MVP scope (what to build, what to cut)\n\nThen it proposes design system options with actual live previews you can see in the browser\n\nThen tech stack\n\nThen it spits out markdown spec files you can feed directly to Cursor/Claude/whatever\n\nThe thing that I think actually makes this useful is that the AI doesn't ask you dumb questions like \"what font do you want?\" it just proposes 3 options and you pick one. Way faster.\n\nAlso you can stop at any step. Like if you just need help figuring out your MVP scope, cool, you don't have to go through the whole thing.\n\nIt's fully client side, your API keys stay in your browser, and it works with OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude.\n\nAnyway it's free and open source:\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect](https://github.com/mohdhd/vibe-architect)\n\nLive demo: [https://specs-gen.vercel.app](https://specs-gen.vercel.app)\n\nCurious what you guys think.

My threads would start focused and then turn into spaghetti because I'd ask 5 follow-up questions that weren't really part of the main flow.\n\nSo I added a feature to my extension ([GPT Threads](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm_source=item-share-cb)) where you can ask side questions in a collapsible panel. The response shows up there without cluttering your main chat. The turn still exists in ChatGPT's history (so context is preserved) but it's visually hidden so your main thread stays clean.\n\nIt's honestly changed how I use ChatGPT. I can explore tangents, ask for clarifications, or test variations without turning my chat into chaos.\n\nIf you're someone who has 50+ turn conversations that become unreadable halfway through, this might help.\n\nHappy to answer questions or hear if anyone's solved this differently!\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm\\_source=item-share-cb](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fdmnglmekmchcbnpaklgbpndclcekbkg?utm_source=item-share-cb)",
