Which skill has the most demand now? There's a lot of competition everywhere and 1000s of people unemployed in every niche.\n\nWhat skill would you suggest me in this era?",

Meaning, look for a problem in that area and find a way to solve it (and charge for that).\n\nSounds simple right? Yet I have three or four concepts (most with websites) that are going nowhere because I'm awful at taking my own advice. One is paranormal, one is a delivery company, and one is political. Lately I've been thinking about universal health care.\n\nI'm stuck at the \"monetizing it\" part. You need to find out what you're passionate about, and provide a solution to their problem. Then you can \"run the numbers\" as I like to say. You figure out what it costs to provide the solution (including every cost plus contingency), and then add your profit margin. That's your price. Now see if the market will bear it. Look at competitors or similar products. Who's your market? Do they / can they / will they spend on this?\n\nAs for scalability, if it's a viable concept it should apply to enough people to reach some kind of *critical mass* of operations.\n\nJust my two cents. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBTW, if you're 21, learn as much as you can about everything you can get your eyeballs on. So often later in life we \"discover our true passion.\" Some of that is maturity and previous life experiences. Some just bumbled into something they were really passionate about. \n\nSo much inspiration happens as you learn stuff.\n\nLearn as much stuff as you can.

I get that collapsed feeling.\n\nHere's what I wish someone told me back then: you're not starting from zero. You learned what doesn't work, and that's actually more valuable than most people realize. I spent years chasing quick wins (dropshipping that got banned, crypto schemes, all that) because I thought I'd be rich by now. Spoiler alert, I wasn't. But all that failure taught me I needed something sustainable, something with actual purpose.\n\nRight now you're probably feeling scattered and maybe looking at too many options at once. Been there. My Notion is still packed with half started ideas. What helped me was asking: what made me feel purpose before? For me it was coaching soccer for kids. That's why I'm building my coaching business now.\n\nWhat's one thing you've done in the past that actually made you feel alive? Start there.

      "text": "If you’re thinking about taking the leap into franchising, here’s some hard-earned perspective from someone who’s worked with dozens of first-time owners.\n\nThe biggest thing I see people underestimate isn’t the upfront cost. It’s the day-to-day reality. Owning a franchise isn’t passive income. Even “semi-absentee” models require 10–15 hours a week just to manage payroll, vendors, and staff. That structure the franchise provides is helpful, but it doesn’t replace leadership.\n\nAnother surprise? Staffing. Hiring reliable people is harder than most expect. One bad hire can create headaches that ripple through your business and burn you out if you’re not careful.\n\nCash flow also comes as a shock. Even profitable units need reserves to cover unexpected costs, slow months, or marketing experiments. Thinking you’ll “break even quickly” is usually too optimistic.\n\nOn the bright side, the support from the franchise, training, systems, branding, is invaluable, especially if you’re coming from corporate. It’s like a blueprint, but you still need to execute it well.\n\nIf I could give one piece of advice to a first-time franchisee: go slow, plan meticulously, and test your workflow before scaling. Enjoy the process, celebrate small wins, and treat the business like a system, not a side hustle.\n\nFranchising can be incredibly rewarding if you go in with your eyes open.",

I think a lot of people come into it assuming that because of the brand name, everything will be automated, but in reality it is still very much a people-and-process business.\n\nThe staffing point really resonated with me. Most new owners focus on location, funding, or marketing, but the biggest challenge is often staffing and managing workflow. From what I have seen working with small business teams, owners who treat hiring as a system tend to experience less burnout than those who react to problems as they arise.\n\nI also completely agree about cash flow surprises. Even profitable setups can feel stressful when processes are not streamlined. Many newer franchisees have started automating smaller administrative tasks such as lead tracking, customer follow-ups, and reporting dashboards to protect their time. Once repetitive tasks are reduced, it becomes easier to think like an owner instead of an operator.\n\nThe biggest shift seems to be the “business as a system” mindset you mentioned. Scaling becomes smoother when people focus less on working harder and more on designing workflows that run consistently, whether through vetted freelancers, automation tools, or structured support models.",

It's not posting. It's lurking with intent.\n\nDoing this manually for Reddit took me countless hours.

      "text": "here's a funny story that happened to me last year and gave me an insight in how larger influencers see direct partnerships with brands.\n\nin 2025 I tested a new product that I developed in the pet space. it was a different type of dog treat dispenser and I wanted to see if it could rank for higher volume keywords even if it was different from most treat dispensers on amazon.\n\nto launch my product I contacted hundreds of small influencers (5k-50k followers on Instagram) offering to send them my product to get their feedback. the idea was that they would want to post about it if they liked it... and it worked! dozens of them posted on launch day.\n\nthis story is about one of them.\n\nI found Mina's dog with 6k followers on Instagram. She gave me her address to send her the product to try. After a week I followed up asking if she tried it. She replied:\n\n**\"OMG MY PIG LOVES IT!\"**\n\n...wait, what?!\n\nit turns out that Mina has a dog with 6k followers but she has also **a pet pig called Merlin with 800k followers on Instagram and over 1.5M followers on TikTok** (he's really cute). Apparently Merlin really liked my treat dispenser and she wanted to post about it!\n\nI was stoked!\n\nI was offering everyone 30% affiliate fees. I wasn't using any tool at the time and I created Amazon Attribution links manually for each one of them. They all got their links and shared them in their content.\n\n**but Mina didn't want my 30% commission!** she preferred to post using Merlin's Amazon Associates link which only gives her \\~4%!\n\nall the micro influencers generated only a few sales so they were ok with me sending screenshots of the Amazon Attribution dashboard and payments via Venmo / PayPal.\n\nMina knows that Amazon will pay Merlin the 4% commissions on his sales, but she doesn't know my brand. she was really nice and supportive of my product, but given the volume of sales she can generate, she prefers certainity of payment from Amazon, over a less certain commission that is 7x bigger! She also wants to see how many sales she generated for that specific profuct, and my Amazon Attribution screenshots are not ideal for that.\n\nAfter this experience I built a tool called Coral to manage Amazon affiliates. Now influencers see the same data I see, directly from my Amazon Attribution and payouts are automatic. So they know they will get paid and exactly how much.\n\nSo to recap here's the insight:  \n**big influencers value certainty of getting paid over commission value.**\n\nI thought that offering 30% instead of 4% will make it a no-brainer for them to work with me, but that was the case only for small creators who do this as a hobby.\n\nThey still convert in sales, but Merlin the Pig generated many more sales! I can't tell how many because it's hidden on their Amazon Associates dashboard, but to this day I get reviews from people talking about how their pet pig loves the treat dispenser (lol).",

The key is finding something that fits your schedule, budget, and lifestyle.\n\nIt can be worth it if you’re looking for a structured business with a proven model, but it’s not “set it and forget it.” You’ll still need to stay involved, even if part-time.\n\nFor those who’ve tried, did running a franchise on the side feel doable or more overwhelming than expected?",
