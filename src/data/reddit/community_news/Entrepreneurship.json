Which skill has the most demand now? There's a lot of competition everywhere and 1000s of people unemployed in every niche.\n\nWhat skill would you suggest me in this era?",

Multiple businesses banned right when they hit their stride, an NFT project that crushed my mental health, then another year wasted when the team fell apart. I get that collapsed feeling.\n\nHere's what I wish someone told me back then: you're not starting from zero. You learned what doesn't work, and that's actually more valuable than most people realize. I spent years chasing quick wins (dropshipping that got banned, crypto schemes, all that) because I thought I'd be rich by now. Spoiler alert, I wasn't. But all that failure taught me I needed something sustainable, something with actual purpose.\n\nRight now you're probably feeling scattered and maybe looking at too many options at once. Been there. My Notion is still packed with half started ideas. What helped me was asking: what made me feel purpose before? For me it was coaching soccer for kids. That's why I'm building my coaching business now.\n\nWhat's one thing you've done in the past that actually made you feel alive? Start there. Rebuilding isn't about doing everything, it's about doing the right thing consistently.",

Meaning, look for a problem in that area and find a way to solve it (and charge for that).\n\nSounds simple right? Yet I have three or four concepts (most with websites) that are going nowhere because I'm awful at taking my own advice. One is paranormal, one is a delivery company, and one is political. Lately I've been thinking about universal health care.\n\nI'm stuck at the \"monetizing it\" part. You need to find out what you're passionate about, and provide a solution to their problem. Then you can \"run the numbers\" as I like to say. You figure out what it costs to provide the solution (including every cost plus contingency), and then add your profit margin. That's your price. Now see if the market will bear it. Look at competitors or similar products. Who's your market? Do they / can they / will they spend on this?\n\nAs for scalability, if it's a viable concept it should apply to enough people to reach some kind of *critical mass* of operations.\n\nJust my two cents. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBTW, if you're 21, learn as much as you can about everything you can get your eyeballs on. So often later in life we \"discover our true passion.\" Some of that is maturity and previous life experiences. Some just bumbled into something they were really passionate about. \n\nSo much inspiration happens as you learn stuff.\n\nLearn as much stuff as you can.

I also run my own local service business, so I understand customer acquisition in a traditional sense.\nBut SaaS marketing feels like a different universe.\nThere’s so much noise:\n\n“Build in public”\n“Do SEO”\n“Post daily on LinkedIn”\n“Cold email at scale”\n“Run ads”\n“Start a community”\n“Hire influencers”\n\nAnd whenever I ask for advice, the default response is: “Get a cofounder.” “Hire a marketing person.”\n\nThat’s fine advice long-term. But I’m asking as a solo founder who wants to learn distribution properly not outsource the skill immediately.\n\nFor those who’ve grown a SaaS solo:\n\n1) What channel actually moved the needle ?\n2) How did you validate it before going all in?\n3) Did you focus on one channel aggressively or test multiple?\n4) Any specific tools or systems that helped you stay consistent?\n5) Im not afraid of hard work. I just don’t want to spray energy across 10 channels without a clear approach.\n\nIf anyone has a structured way of thinking about SaaS marketing as a technical founder, I’d genuinely appreciate it.\n\nFor context - we're building a B2C job platform focused on helping job seekers apply smarter and faster. It's not just a traditional job board; we're combining curated listings with automation tools that reduce friction in the application process and increase response rates.\n",

One key insight is that marketing goes far beyond simply posting on social media.\n\nIf you want your SaaS product to succeed, it needs a distinctive quality something that sets it apart from competitors. Beyond that, smart positioning and bold communication matter. On platforms like Twitter or X, being witty, sharp, and occasionally provocative can help generate word-of-mouth if done strategically and within limits.\n\nSometimes, brands gain attention by briefly challenging or playfully critiquing larger companies. When done cleverly, this can spark conversations and visibility. Another powerful tactic is creating curiosity and FOMO (fear of missing out), which encourages people to explore your product.\n\nA well-known example is Bumble. In its early days, it relied on creative grassroots marketing strategies to gain traction. The team reportedly used campus ambassador programs and community-based promotion to build exclusivity and buzz among college students. These kinds of stunts helped generate attention without requiring massive advertising budgets.\n\nThe main takeaway is this: Learn to create stunts which are cost afforable to you and your company because getting idea and making idea is easy but getting popular is difficult.\n\ni hope this message helps you ",

      "text": "If you’re thinking about taking the leap into franchising, here’s some hard-earned perspective from someone who’s worked with dozens of first-time owners.\n\nThe biggest thing I see people underestimate isn’t the upfront cost. It’s the day-to-day reality. Owning a franchise isn’t passive income. Even “semi-absentee” models require 10–15 hours a week just to manage payroll, vendors, and staff. That structure the franchise provides is helpful, but it doesn’t replace leadership.\n\nAnother surprise? Staffing. Hiring reliable people is harder than most expect. One bad hire can create headaches that ripple through your business and burn you out if you’re not careful.\n\nCash flow also comes as a shock. Even profitable units need reserves to cover unexpected costs, slow months, or marketing experiments. Thinking you’ll “break even quickly” is usually too optimistic.\n\nOn the bright side, the support from the franchise, training, systems, branding, is invaluable, especially if you’re coming from corporate. It’s like a blueprint, but you still need to execute it well.\n\nIf I could give one piece of advice to a first-time franchisee: go slow, plan meticulously, and test your workflow before scaling. Enjoy the process, celebrate small wins, and treat the business like a system, not a side hustle.\n\nFranchising can be incredibly rewarding if you go in with your eyes open.",

I think a lot of people come into it assuming that because of the brand name, everything will be automated, but in reality it is still very much a people-and-process business.\n\nThe staffing point really resonated with me. Most new owners focus on location, funding, or marketing, but the biggest challenge is often staffing and managing workflow. From what I have seen working with small business teams, owners who treat hiring as a system tend to experience less burnout than those who react to problems as they arise.\n\nI also completely agree about cash flow surprises. Even profitable setups can feel stressful when processes are not streamlined. Many newer franchisees have started automating smaller administrative tasks such as lead tracking, customer follow-ups, and reporting dashboards to protect their time. Once repetitive tasks are reduced, it becomes easier to think like an owner instead of an operator.\n\nThe biggest shift seems to be the “business as a system” mindset you mentioned. Scaling becomes smoother when people focus less on working harder and more on designing workflows that run consistently, whether through vetted freelancers, automation tools, or structured support models.",

It’s still very much a people-and-process business. Staffing alone can make or break the experience. I like what you said about treating hiring as a system instead of constantly reacting. That mindset shift probably saves a lot of burnout. And yes, thinking of the business as a system instead of just working harder, that’s the real game changer.",

      "text": "We talk about coding, marketing, and sales skills. But before any of that, you need to know where your customers are. I call this community reconnaissance.\n\nIt's the systematic process of mapping the online spaces where your potential users gather, understanding their rules, their language, and their pain points. It's not posting. It's lurking with intent.\n\nDoing this manually for Reddit took me countless hours. I'd find a great subreddit, only to realize it banned self-promotion entirely, or that it was actually inactive.\n\nThis reconnaissance phase is a massive time sink that isn't taught. I built Reoogle to automate the mapping part, but the lesson is universal: invest time in understanding the landscape before you try to sell in it. How do you conduct your own community recon for new ideas?",

      "text": "here's a funny story that happened to me last year and gave me an insight in how larger influencers see direct partnerships with brands.\n\nin 2025 I tested a new product that I developed in the pet space. it was a different type of dog treat dispenser and I wanted to see if it could rank for higher volume keywords even if it was different from most treat dispensers on amazon.\n\nto launch my product I contacted hundreds of small influencers (5k-50k followers on Instagram) offering to send them my product to get their feedback. the idea was that they would want to post about it if they liked it... and it worked! dozens of them posted on launch day.\n\nthis story is about one of them.\n\nI found Mina's dog with 6k followers on Instagram. She gave me her address to send her the product to try. After a week I followed up asking if she tried it. She replied:\n\n**\"OMG MY PIG LOVES IT!\"**\n\n...wait, what?!\n\nit turns out that Mina has a dog with 6k followers but she has also **a pet pig called Merlin with 800k followers on Instagram and over 1.5M followers on TikTok** (he's really cute). Apparently Merlin really liked my treat dispenser and she wanted to post about it!\n\nI was stoked!\n\nI was offering everyone 30% affiliate fees. I wasn't using any tool at the time and I created Amazon Attribution links manually for each one of them. They all got their links and shared them in their content.\n\n**but Mina didn't want my 30% commission!** she preferred to post using Merlin's Amazon Associates link which only gives her \\~4%!\n\nall the micro influencers generated only a few sales so they were ok with me sending screenshots of the Amazon Attribution dashboard and payments via Venmo / PayPal.\n\nMina knows that Amazon will pay Merlin the 4% commissions on his sales, but she doesn't know my brand. she was really nice and supportive of my product, but given the volume of sales she can generate, she prefers certainity of payment from Amazon, over a less certain commission that is 7x bigger! She also wants to see how many sales she generated for that specific profuct, and my Amazon Attribution screenshots are not ideal for that.\n\nAfter this experience I built a tool called Coral to manage Amazon affiliates. Now influencers see the same data I see, directly from my Amazon Attribution and payouts are automatic. So they know they will get paid and exactly how much.\n\nSo to recap here's the insight:  \n**big influencers value certainty of getting paid over commission value.**\n\nI thought that offering 30% instead of 4% will make it a no-brainer for them to work with me, but that was the case only for small creators who do this as a hobby.\n\nThey still convert in sales, but Merlin the Pig generated many more sales! I can't tell how many because it's hidden on their Amazon Associates dashboard, but to this day I get reviews from people talking about how their pet pig loves the treat dispenser (lol).",

It's less about whether the franchise itself is manageable and more about whether YOU can handle something that still needs your attention without becoming your whole life. I used to think I could run multiple income streams at once, and technically I could, but the mental load was way heavier than the actual work. The real question isn't can you do it part time, it's more like: do you have the emotional bandwidth for another thing that requires decisions and problem solving? Even semi passive businesses aren't truly passive. There's always something. My take is this. If you're already stretched thin or dealing with other life stuff, a franchise might add structure but it'll also add weight. But if you're looking for that structure and you're honest about what part time really means (not just hoping it'll run itself), then yeah it could work. Just don't underestimate how much headspace it takes even when the systems are good. The proven model helps but you're still the one steering it.",

Even “semi-passive” models require decisions, oversight, and problem-solving.\n\nYou’re right. It’s not just “Can I run this part-time?” It’s “Do I have the headspace for this?” If someone is already stretched thin, even a well-built franchise can feel heavy. But if they’re looking for structure and are realistic about the involvement, it can actually reduce chaos compared to starting from scratch.\n\nAppreciate you sharing that perspective.

      "text": "The dream of a post going viral and bringing in thousands of users is seductive, but it's a lottery ticket. For the last quarter, I've ignored virality and focused on a simple metric: 'Number of days per week I provide genuine value in my target communities.'\n\nThat value could be a helpful comment, sharing a useful resource (not mine), or asking a thought-provoking question. The goal is consistent presence.\n\nThe results? Traffic from Reddit is smaller but steady and predictable. The users who come are higher quality and more likely to stick around. I've also built real relationships with a few other founders in those spaces.\n\nIt's a boring strategy, but it's building a foundation that a one-time viral hit never could. Is anyone else deliberately choosing slow-and-steady over boom-or-bust on social platforms?",

      "text": "My first ever online sale was a tiny fishing rod that folded into your pocket.\n\nThe ads were hilarious guys pulling out these ridiculous little rods and landing massive fish. The reel was decent. The rod was garbage. I wasn't proud of selling it, and I quit pretty fast.\n\nBut I remember the sound. That little *ting* from the Shopify notification. First sale. Wasn't even profitable. Didn't matter. I was hooked. That sound rewired my brain.\n\nThat was about 10 years ago. Since then I've built 4 businesses. Here's the unfiltered version.\n\n**The content machine**\n\nAfter the fishing rod disaster, I started creating content about making money online. No audience, no money, no plan. Just a Facebook group and a phone.\n\nI posted every day. Grew a YouTube channel to 160K subs. Built a Telegram community that hit 35,000 people. Created 230 online courses over a few years.\n\nTotal revenue: around €5M. Margins: \\~80%.\n\nI was basically a one-man operation printing money. But here's what I don't tell people often: I burned through that audience. We went for short-term cashflow instead of building a real community. Hit and run. I was young, it was my first real business, and I optimized for cash instead of lifetime value. If I could go back, I'd build the community-first approach I understand now. Lesson learned the expensive way.\n\n**The million-euro Telegram message**\n\nFlushed with confidence, I built a crypto company. Grew it to 60 employees. We were launching our own token and hired the best team in the space, the guys who had done the biggest launches.\n\nWe sent them €1,000,000 for the liquidity pools. Launch day comes. 2,000 people on the livestream. Countdown hits. 18:00. Nothing. 18:05. Nothing. 18:10. Nothing.\n\nI'm trying to call them. No answer. Messaging on Telegram. No answer. My co-founder is looking at me. 2,000 people are watching. And all I can think is: we just got scammed out of a million euros.\n\nMy hands were shaking. Not the metaphorical \"entrepreneur stress\" kind. Actually shaking.\n\nIt got resolved eventually. They hadn't scammed us; they'd just completely dropped the ball. We found an arrangement, relaunched, and made it work. But the company that was supposed to be our strongest link turned out to be our weakest. And for about 45 minutes, I genuinely thought I'd lost everything.\n\nI sold that company eventually. Good exit. And the Monday after the deal closed, I had nothing to do. No team. No fires. Nothing. Turns out selling a company feels less like a victory and more like an identity crisis with a nice bank balance.\n\n**The beautiful money pit**\n\nNow I'm in Lisbon running a lead gen agency Meta Ads, with multiple verticals, €10M+ in ad spend managed, and €45M+ generated for clients. The agency runs at about a 90% margin. That part works great.\n\nBut I also built a 200m² podcast studio here. It's gorgeous. I host clients, throw events, and run community meetups. I love it. And it's been losing money for 2 years straight.\n\nI've asked myself a hundred times if I should shut it down. On paper, it makes zero sense. But it's my first physical business, and there's something about having a space where people walk in and say \"this is incredible\" that no Stripe dashboard will ever give you.\n\nCall it a trophy asset. Call it ego. Maybe both. But I keep it running.\n\n**The scary one**\n\nNow I'm building a SaaS. AI-powered video content at scale solves a problem I lived every day in the agency. I AM the target customer.\n\nAnd this one scares me. Not because I doubt the product. But because for the first time, I can't just close a client or launch a course to make money next week. It's build, ship, learn, repeat. No shortcuts.\n\nBut honestly? I'm not worried about failure. If this doesn't work, I kill it fast and move on. That's the one thing 10 years taught me: fail fast or bleed slow. The studio is proof that I'm still learning that lesson.\n\nWhat I actually have now, that I didn't have at 24 with my fishing rod ads, is skills that compound no matter what happens. I know AI better than 99% of people in my industry. I know paid media. I know community building. The vehicle might change. The engine doesn't.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about being 4 businesses deep: starting over doesn't get easier. It gets scarier. You have more to lose. More people watching. More ego on the line. But the clarity gets sharper. You stop chasing revenue and start chasing the right problems.\n\nSo here's what I want to ask you, and I mean it:\n\n**What's the moment that rewired YOUR brain? The fishing-rod moment, the shaking-hands moment, the \"this makes no sense but I can't stop\" moment. What was yours?**\n\nI'd love to hear it.",

A very inspiring journey. \n\nI was part of the management of a company with 3.500 employees and was by far the youngest in the top management. I didn't like the culture and I had a moment in a management round where I looked at the other \"top managers\" and thought to myself:   \nNone of them has a life that I would want to have. I wouldn't want to swap places with any of them. Honestly, that goes for health, appearance, family, etc. I don't want to life like that when I am in their age (50-60). \n\nSo I quit and finally had the guts to start my own business. \n\nPS:   \nI can't understand why people down vote a post like this.   \nThat can only be out of envy. \n\n",

For me it was chasing different business models, always moving to the next thing instead of sticking with what actually worked. Took me way too long to realize I wasn't building anything real, just collecting ideas.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing though. You've got this pattern of optimizing for the wrong thing. First it was cash over community. Now it's maybe ego over sustainability with the studio. The SaaS scares you because you can't control it the same way, can't just pivot when it gets hard. But honestly? That constraint might be exactly what you need. Sometimes the best growth happens when we can't just bail and start something new.\n\nYou asked about the rewiring moment. Mine was realizing that all my hustle and learning meant nothing without consistency and direction. I had access to hundreds of courses, knew all these models, but I was scatterbrained as hell. The real shift came when I stopped chasing what looked exciting and started asking what actually mattered to me long term. For you, sounds like maybe that studio is trying to tell you something about what you actually value beyond the numbers.",
