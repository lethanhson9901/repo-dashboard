It requires you to have some experience or relation with the customer so you are paid in advance. Some businesses start in that model \n2. Raise easy debt from banks. If you have a good credit score you can always raise funds from a bank to fund your project. \n3. Look for grants in various domains from government initiatives. \n4. The most expensive option is to have an investor may be friends or family or a professional Investor.  But that’s the cost of form of debt since you have to repay a lot \n\nWhen I started my company, I use the first two forms to get my bank balance. I don’t run a large organisation, but I’m good for the last 12 years. The companies remain bootstrap. I am a fan of this because it keeps your business fundamentals on the right track.  \n\nYou can do some freelancing work or pick a job and raise some funds or you can demonstrate your work to some customers and get a gig.",

I’ve worked as a business analyst for 15+ years, and what you’re describing is something I see all the time when a service business grows faster than the internal structure can support.\n\nWhen growth hits you from multiple directions (bigger accounts, hiring needs, operations breaking), it feels like you’re drowning, but usually it comes down to one thing:\n\nYour business outgrew the systems it was built on.\n\nA few things that might help you get your head above water:\n\nIdentify the bottleneck. Your biggest constraint right now is likely operational load, not demand.\n\nAsk yourself: “If I had to 2× tomorrow, what breaks first?” That’s the true problem.\n\nSeparate the business into two lanes:\n• Fulfillment (the service you deliver)\n• Infrastructure (the systems that support it)\nMost founders try to fix both at once and burn out.\n\nPrioritize one structural change, not ten.\nYou mentioned hiring + expanding + fixing operations.\nIt’s tempting to chase all of that.\nPick ONE change that gives you the most breathing room.\n\nIf you want, I’m running a small prototype where I help entrepreneurs map their business clearly and spot the bottlenecks holding them back. Happy to take a look and give you some direction at no cost, no pitch, just clarity.\n\nEither way, you’re not crazy, this stage hits every business that grows fast.

Penser la croissance non pas comme “faire plus”, mais comme **faire autrement**, pour éviter que tout repose sur toi et permettre un développement futur sans t'épuiser.\n\nJ’accompagne des dirigeants de TPE/PME dans ce type de phase de croissance (quand ça va bien… mais que ça devient lourd à porter).  \nSi tu veux, tu peux m’écrire en message privé : je peux te poser quelques questions pour t’aider à y voir plus clair, sans engagement.",

      "text": "Five years ago, I was laid off from a job I had dedicated years to. It was one of the hardest moments in my career., frustrating, confusing, and scary.\n\nLooking back, that layoff became a turning point. I decided to explore starting my own BPO. It wasn’t easy, I had to learn team management, systems, compliance, and how to run operations from scratch. Every step taught me more about resilience and trusting my own capabilities.\n\nToday, I see that moment not as a setback, but as the start of an entirely new journey. Being laid off pushed me to explore paths I never would have considered, and gave me confidence I didn’t know I had.\n\nSometimes, a career setback isn’t the end. It’s the start of the path you were meant to take.",

Communication (especially how to pitch); Learn how to communicate ideas as quickly as possible (as someone that gives a lot of attention to details, learning this was somehow strange) \n\n4. Understand the basics of finance (Learn cashflow statement, balance sheet and income statement, understand working capital, it's the life bar in the game we play called \"business\")\n\n5. Learn whatever you want to learn (maybe what you are passionate about)\n\n6. You could take it a step further by learning about the basics of economics.\n\n\n  At the end, permit me to say, just have enough conviction in what you set out to do.. if it works out, everything falls into place (most times)\n\nLet me throw in this one\n\n7. Know yourself (your capabilities, and what you wish they would be in future, your current limitations, and what they might be in future, your weaknesses, what they might be in future, what guardrails you need to put in place now and what guardrails you might need to put in place in the future etc etc...)\n\nDepending on your situations.. you may not be bothered about money now. \n\nYou may choose to Divide the year into 2 or 3 months and learn each of these, even if it's just for 1hr each day. (I did this through 2023/24) \n\nI failed to learn some things like communication (pitching aspect) until last Year when I set about building a company and realized I had to depend on my co-founder to do the pitching (he wasn't really communicating the ideas well enough. I had to learn by listening, doing, failing, learning, & doing it again)\n\nHowever, I learnt almost every other thing here, and the roi is Good.",

Luck and chance happen to us all. There is a quote that basically says this \"if working hard made you rich donkeys would be covered in gold\" \n\nI have also known people who make great money but are always broke (lifestyle creep and poor life partner choices can burn you real good)\n\nyou can make serious money as a Doctor, Lawyer, Software Engineer, Investor, running a septic tank service business etc.. Your asking someone to predict the future \"If i do A i will get B\" Sorry life don't work that way.\n\nJust keep making the wisest most logical choice you can given you gifts, talents, interests, and resources and I hope the best for your future.",

Do you actually track your win rate in real time or close to it or do you just look at it once a month and move on.\n\nI run an online store and we handle disputes across a couple payment methods. I realized recently that I dont really have a clear picture of how well our dispute process is working week to week. We know roughly how many cases we win but its usually after the fact and not tied to any specific changes we make.\n\nFeels like if you dont know your current win rate its hard to know whether your evidence process or responses are actually improving anything.\n\nJust looking to learn how other teams handle this in practice.",

The way I saw it, SWE was a linear technical skill. Something you can learn from a book or a course.\n\n Entrepreneurship isn’t.\n\nSo I wanted to get behind the scenes.\nThat mix of being tech-savvy and having some marketing background quickly made me a trusted asset to my clients. I ended up taking on something close to a COO role.\n\nWhat made things suck was this: most entrepreneurs act on impulse.\n\nAnd not just in marketing or sales. Much deeper than that. Decisions coming from unresolved stuff. Past trauma. Insecurities. You name it.\n\nThat’s where it gets hard.\n\nBecause pushing back on an impulsive decision doesn’t land as an opinion. It lands as a personal attack. As invalidating their feelings. And even pointing that dynamic out feels like an attack, no matter how carefully you phrase it.\n\nThis shows up as obsession with the newest trend. The latest one? AI. Even when there’s no real use case for it. Just to realize $40,000 later.\n\nIt shows up as working until 2 a.m. every night, double-checking the work of team members who’ve been there for years and have already proven themselves.\n\nSpoiler: you won’t find anything.\n\nThat’s not about quality control. That’s about trust. Or avoidance. Or running from something else in life and needing to stay busy.\n\nAnd it goes on. And on.\n\nThe hardest part is that most are unwilling to accept this simple truth: personal struggles are not separate from business problems.\nThey bleed into everything.\n\nThey cloud your judgment as an entrepreneur.

          "text": "Y Combinator tasks founders with discovery of \"hair on fire\" problems. Founders much prefer any lame excuse to start coding. I wrote a post about problem curation but don't link because nobody gave a shit.\n\nAll the problems are real. The mirages come from chasing after an inconsequential minor inconvenience because it is easy to solve. A targetable group has to want to solve the problem urgently enough to pay good money for a solution. You won't get that making excuses while developing a 'Hello World' product.\n\nScratching your own itch is a way to strip off the context of market validation and problem curation. You make the decision it is a problem you'll solve in a market vacuum. Doesn't matter in the least if anybody pays. Degree of pain and urgency is obvious if it took that long to make up your mind it was problem enough to scratch.\n\nIf you are calling it an itch don't bother wondering how many will pay. \n\nBecause validation is just a means to generate false positives, nobody asks the pertinent questions. If you ask how much somebody has spent to solve a problem over the last year and they say \"nothing\" ...take the hint and move on.\n\nI believe way too many are hellbent on their idea simply due to fear of coming up with another idea. Yet founders should be idea factories. Every product should be made up of many ideas.",
