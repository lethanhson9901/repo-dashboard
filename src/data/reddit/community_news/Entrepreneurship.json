      "text": "I import consumer electronics from China and sell to USA retailers. I mostly sell USB chargers and power banks, and do about $12M a year in revenue, with roughly $2.5M tied up in inventory.\n\nOne of my customers’ houses just burned down, and they’re claiming one of my USB chargers caused it, and now they’re demanding indemnification under our contract.\n\nThat’s when I found out something I honestly can’t believe I missed, as I have zero product liability coverage, and it’s excluded from my general liability policy.\n\nMy broker says I need $5M to $10M in product liability insurance, the quote came back at $48K per year. Until now, I was paying $18K total for our existing coverage.\n\nI get why it’s expensive, and that chargers and power banks are literal fire risks. My QC is sample-based, not 100 percent inspection, and while my Chinese suppliers claim they have insurance, I’ve never actually seen proof or been named on a policy.\n\nNow it’s really hitting me how exposed I am. One serious failure could wipe out everything I’ve built, and this isn’t hypothetical anymore, it’s happening.",

There’s the money, the responsibility, and learning a whole new business model all at once. But it can also be an amazing way to get into business with a proven system, support network, and structure that really helps you grow.\n\nFrom my experience helping people explore franchise opportunities, the ones who succeed usually pick something that fits their skills, interests, and lifestyle. That alignment makes all the difference between burning out and actually enjoying the journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has done it. If you bought a franchise in your 20s or 30s, would you do it again? What surprised you the most, and what advice would you give to someone thinking about taking the leap now?",

Turned out he did a better job than I expected and now he actually owns that whole piece of operations, troubleshoots issues himself, pulls the reports.

Not being so myopically narcissistic you can't understand anybody else's motivations. \n\nIn short: Human Nature. The environment your business must succeed in. People without this fundamental understanding of human nature are going to be in for many unpleasant surprises. Strip away the sophisticated terms and economics and, yes capitalism too is human nature. The root word of marketing is *market.* You don't get anywhere being naïve. \n\nStarting a business without understanding human nature is like living on a houseboat without knowing how to swim.

Build your messaging, demo, and even outreach around that single moment.\n\nMost content tools fail early because they market “AI content” instead of owning one stressful job.\n\nIf you want, share what *specific situation* users come to you for right now, and I can help pressure-test that angle.",

Pure and simple, it's a way for neo-maxi-zoom-dweebies to eliminate human nature from software production *to the exclusion of all else.*\n\nAn obligatory survey posting that gets as little as three replies seems sufficient to satisfy the standard Build It And They Will Come venture. People are always posting to ask if three, six, twelve responses -- nobody paid but a moment's attention to fill out -- is enough 'market traction' to launch. They are ridiculous but consistent; I can't remember how long it has been since anybody *claimed to have* even twenty responses. \n\nAnd they didn't seem to see a problem until one dreadful minute of silence after launch. Yet their amazement seemed genuine. Seems getting into tech to avoid human nature sure can be a bitch when you need those bastards to buy your shit. \n\nDistribution is an interesting choice of word, full of meaning and forecasting, well ...profoundly disappointing outcomes. Want a real distribution \"problem?\" Put up a landing page and Buy Now button. If 32,468 people click in a reasonable time -- that's the problem you want to have.

Something that requires hand and eye coordination and dexterity.\n\nIf you're playing catch with a friend and you're talking about something you're passionate about, like some video game or something, you flow. You don't stutter or have pregnant pauses or anxiety, you also won't be dropping the ball and throwing poorly.\n\nThe goal is to be as smooth as a gravy sandwich.\n\nRepetition is the mother of all skill. If you prepare, you will overcome the anxieties because passion and reflex will take over.\n\nI used to gather my sales teams every morning before the bell rang. We had an assortment of dexterity based activities from boxing to ping pong. The room would be a murmur of noise of everyone, pitching. And fielding rebuttals and objections, isolating and overcoming, and then back in line with their pitches.\n\nYou also need to believe in whatever you're doing, where you'll never reach the point of being passionate about. I had my son do cold calling for my business kind of as an uncomfortable lesson. Picking up that phone took him almost an hour for the first time. He was like dad this is hard. Then, we worked on his script.He had it memorized because I told him he had to. He even had some of the objections and rebuttals memorized. But he stuttered and stammered, and his tone changed, and i'm warbled, he pregnant paused, he got tripped up if anything unexpected came his way.\n\nThen we started playing catch. I told him imagine that you've got a truckload of playstation 5s. You're your only job is to get rid of them by the end of the day. And you gotta sell them for twenty five dollars, apiece. Could you do it?\n\nHe was like hell yeah that's crazy! \n\nI'm well, that's the equivalent of what my company sells. We provide truck parts that are made with higher grid materials, improved and patented designs that shorten the installation time from forty five minutes down to 5 minutes. The parts are required consumable and universal. They go on every truck on the planet. The best part is we sell them for about 50+% less than anyone else in the world. \n\nPeople would be stupid not to buy my product. I know that, and I make sure they know that. \n\nOnce, he believed in what we were providing and he understood the price matrix. It became selling playstation 5s for $25.\n\nWe practice the script while throwing the ball and laughing and talking. Within an hour or so, he was smooth. He did regress a bit on the phone because his age. He was 14. He wanted to call everyone, sir.And make sure they're having a good day and none of that was in the script. \n\nIn 9 weeks he had landed 27 Southern Tire Mart locations, 15 new Speedco/Loves locations, and 11 independent repair shops. He made a few thousand dollars in commissions up front, and still sees about $75-$450 a month in residual commissions, 2 years later.",
