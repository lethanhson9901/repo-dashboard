      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some realistic advice because I’ve been spinning my wheels a bit trying to get bookkeeping clients.\n\n**Background:**  \nI have a college diploma in accounting and about a year of combined experience (school + \\~9 months as a staff accountant/bookkeeper). I’m not a CPA, and I’m not trying to position myself as one. I’m aiming strictly at **basic bookkeeping** for small businesses (monthly books, reconciliations, cleanup, etc.).\n\n**What I’ve done so far:**\n\n* Set up a simple service offering (monthly bookkeeping, cleanup)\n* Reached out to small businesses locally (cold emails / DMs)\n* Posted in a few Facebook and Reddit groups (mostly ignored or very low response)\n* Talked to people I know personally (some interest, nothing converted)\n* Tried to keep pricing reasonable and transparent\n* I’m confident in my ability to do the work once I actually get a client\n\n**Where I’m struggling:**\n\n* Getting *any* traction or responses\n* People seem hesitant to trust someone without a CPA or years of solo experience\n* Competing with very cheap overseas bookkeepers and very established firms at the same time\n* Feeling like I’m stuck in the “need clients to get experience, need experience to get clients” loop\n\nI’m not expecting instant success or big money. I just want **my first few real clients** so I can build proof, testimonials, and momentum.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Is this just normal early-stage friction, or am I missing something obvious?\n* Where did your *first* bookkeeping clients actually come from?\n* Should I niche down harder (industry, software, cleanup only, etc.)?\n* Is it smarter to work under another firm first before trying solo?\n* Any mistakes you see beginners make that I might be making?\n\nI’m open to blunt feedback. If the answer is “this takes way longer than you think” or “you’re approaching it wrong,” I’d rather hear that now.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share real experiences.",

Is a great point, but you have to assume they don't really have a good system and find the pain. The majority of the people I cold called hated reconciliations and stumbled through it. All of them really wanted to be assured that they had their chart of accouts setup correctly. \n\nThat's where I made my money. I just needed extra cash and would make a couple hundred bucks here or there, but it added up. It took awhile to get out of that side gig as my primary business grew larger. \n\nOP you need to be scrappy, lean on social engineering, and real talk people skills. You cannot compete face to face with accounting firms, but your target customer of family owned small businesses cannot justify the spend to use those firms until they have to.",

Small businesses rarely switch bookkeepers unless something is broken, so cold outreach usually falls flat. Not having a CPA isn’t the blocker either. “Basic bookkeeping” just sounds interchangeable, so people hesitate.\n\nMost first clients come from referrals, cleanup work, or subcontracting under another firm. Niching helps a lot, even something simple like a specific software or type of business. Competing on price usually hurts more than it helps.\n\nIf traction feels slow, that doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong.

I said in a previous post that what really helped us branch out is offering totadvi advisory services along with bookkeeping.

      "text": "I’m in my twenties and currently a freelancer making around 8k–14k per month. Margins are basically 100% since it’s just me, and I work around 50-60 hours per week. For where I live, this is very good money.\n\nThe issue is I’m fully booked. Every new opportunity feels like:\n\n* take it and burn out\n* or say no and feel stuck\n\nThat’s what **pushed** **me** **to** **think** **about** **starting a company** and scaling beyond myself, mostly because I’m worried there’s nothing beyond my personal brand and trading time for money.\n\nBut the more I look at the numbers, the less it makes sense.\n\nA realistic service company in my space probably runs on 20–30% margins. To make the same \\~120k/year I make now as a freelancer, the company would need to do something like 400k–500k in revenue. And that’s **just** **to** ***match*** my income, **not even exceed it**, and obviously I wouldn’t just take all of that out personally. All with way more stress, risk, and management.\n\nAlso:\n\n* My clients hire *me*, not a team\n* I’d still be the bottleneck for sales and quality\n* Selling random products doesn’t feel like a real long term asset or exit\n\n**So now I’m torn:**\n\n1. Double down on freelancing + personal brand\n2. Keep freelancing stable and slowly try to build a company or asset on the side\n\nThe math makes scaling feel kinda crazy, but the idea of having nothing beyond freelancing long term also worries me.\n\nCurious how others have thought about this or what they’d do.",

As you said, you need to be significantly large already to exceed solo freelance income. Overhead eats up a lot of the profit.\n\nSo, either think about a product company you could start. I always encourage people who want that to start it on the side. Sacrifice a few days a week of your freelance job to work on the product company. It will take longer than you think before it brings income.\n\nAlternatively just keep doing what you are doing and buy real estate for passive income.",

It’s easy to feel stuck before you even begin. From my experience working with business owners and franchises, there’s no single “right” answer. It really comes down to your goals, your risk tolerance, and how much guidance you want along the way.\n\nSome people love building everything themselves, while others prefer a proven system with support already in place. Both paths can work, it’s about choosing the one that fits you. If you’re just starting to explore your options, don’t rush the decision. Ask questions, learn from people who’ve done it before, and be honest about what kind of business owner you want to be.\n\nCurious to hear how others here decided on their path.

Don't be so hard on yourself, but still be hard on yourself – if that makes sense.   \n2) The fact that you have experimented with even ONE business idea and failed is commendable. I know 50 year olds who are still talking about the same ideas they told me about 10 years ago and haven't even taken one step to progress it.   \n3) When you say, \"I learned Meta Ads\" – this isn't true. The top Meta advertisers in the world haven't \"learned\" Meta Ads. \"Learned\" means completion. What you learned is probably a very basic level of Meta Ads. In other words, if you want to make money here, you must KEEP learning, KEEP experimenting, KEEP iterating, until you almost become a master... and then you realize there's still 400 million things you don't know, so you go back in student mode and keep compounding knowledge and experience. A master of anything knows that you never actually master anything.   \n4) The one thing I don't like about your post is \"... I have no motivation calling any business or haven't started any successful business to use that skill on.\" followed by \"I'm feeling hopeless....\" If you're motivated to not be hopeless, you should be motivated to pick up that phone and call those business owners – if that's going to get you clients. Being a successful entrepreneur (or anything else) means doing the things that are uncomfortable or that you're not motivated to do. Trust me, when you pick up that phone the 300th time and that first person says \"Yes,\" you'll find your motivation. Until then, you need discipline. Discipline is 100x more powerful than motivation. \n\nJust my opinion though!",

When you’re clear on what the business is, what problem it solves, and you’re already taking action, people are much more willing to help or collaborate regardless of your age.\n\nA few realistic points:\n\n* Start solo or with one collaborator, not a full team\n* Look for people who want to learn or build together, not employees\n* Be honest about your situation and limits. Serious people respect clarity more than confidence\n* Your age matters less than whether you’re consistent and reliable\n\nTeams usually form around momentum, not ideas. Build something small first.

I'm in a non-compete is in effect until the fall.   \nI am VERY tempted to ignore it, open early, and offer services that were not available at my old job and be careful with my wording, limit advertising, and do more word of mouth. Keep it limited and small until the non-compete is up- then expand services.   \nBusiness is about risks- but I am worried I will get going, then they will send a cease and desist because they are petty like that. Then it could hurt my business in the long run if I have to shut down- then re-open.   \nI also worry that if I don't get on this now, other people may open up shop before I do and I'll loose this opportunity. \n\nI had an attorney review my non-compete. He doesn't think they could enforce it if I am careful with how I advertise and select the patients I see- as it would not cause them hardship. I just don't want to get tied up with a ton of legal costs. \n\nAny advice? Thoughts?",

If the business you start would violate the terms of the non-compete, wait for the non-compete to expire. \n\nHonor your legal commitments. It’s not only ethical; it’s the smart thing to do. And you won’t lose sleep at night worrying that the word will get out and your petty former employer will make your life an expensive legal hell.\n\nSo I suggest that you either play it safe and wait, or else get a solid second opinion from another attorney, and if they think you wouldn’t be violating the agreement for some reason, at least get their opinion in writing. It’s no guarantee, but it might (maybe, possibly) weigh in your favor with the court when you get sued.",

For someone bootstrapping this, that difference actually matters a lot.\n\nBut honestly, I can't sleep. I've rehearsed this maybe 20 times now. I know my market size, I've got my financial projections ready, I understand the competitive landscape. But there's such a huge gap between knowing your material and actually convincing experienced investors that your idea deserves their time. These people at in5 have seen hundreds of startups. They know immediately what's real and what's just wishful thinking.\n\nI keep imagining them asking why this doesn't exist already if it's such a good idea, or what happens when someone like Careem decides to enter this space, or how exactly I plan to acquire customers without burning through cash. And honestly, the scariest question is probably \"why you?\" I have investment banking experience, I understand this market, I've done months of research. But is that actually enough to build this thing?\n\nWhat do these meetings even focus on? Should I lead with the problem or jump straight to our solution? How deep should I go on the technical AI stuff versus keeping it high level? At this stage with no traction yet, are they looking more at the idea itself or trying to evaluate if I'm the right person to execute it?\n\nIf anyone here has pitched to incubators in GCC, what actually matters in that room? Should I just trust that I've prepared enough and be myself, or is there some specific thing these meetings look for that I might be completely missing? Any advice would really help right now.",

I’m not sure we can really value “code” the way we used to anymore, it’s easier, cheaper, and faster to build now. The real defensibility is in the person (or people) behind it, you!

Make them believe you are the best person to solve this problem, not that you have the perfect solution. Founders should be in love with the problem, not the solution, because the solution will definitely pivot, change, and improve over time. \n\nAll the very best! Let me know how it goes :)",

      "text": "I have been analyzing the sports streaming market for the past eighteen months, and there is a massive opportunity that most entrepreneurs are completely overlooking. With World Cup 2026 coming to North America and streaming rights fragmenting globally, the barriers to entry have dropped while demand is exploding.\n\nThe major platforms like ESPN+, DAZN, and Paramount+ are fighting over premium rights to tier-one leagues. Meanwhile, there are thousands of regional leagues, college sports networks, amateur competitions, and niche sports that cannot secure favorable distribution deals. These content owners are desperate for streaming solutions but lack the technical infrastructure to launch platforms independently.\n\nHere is what makes this opportunity compelling right now. The technology infrastructure that once required millions in investment and entire engineering teams can now be deployed in weeks rather than months. The core components include live streaming architecture, content delivery networks for global reach, ad insertion technology, mobile applications, and payment processing systems. What previously represented an insurmountable barrier to entry has become accessible through modern platform solutions.\n\nThe revenue model is remarkably straightforward and proven. Ad monetization through pre-roll and mid-roll advertising generates the primary revenue stream, particularly when you can offer local and regional advertisers direct access to engaged sports audiences. Subscription tiers provide recurring revenue, while pay-per-view options work exceptionally well for championship events and premium matchups. Sponsorship overlays and branded content create additional streams, and for those willing to navigate the regulatory complexity, fantasy sports and betting integration can dramatically increase user engagement and lifetime value.\n\nThe timing creates a perfect storm of opportunity. World Cup 2026 will drive unprecedented demand for streaming infrastructure across North America. Emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are experiencing explosive growth in mobile-first streaming consumption. Regional advertisers want access to sports audiences but cannot afford the premium rates that major platforms command. Meanwhile, younger demographics have completely abandoned traditional cable and expect all content to be available on mobile devices.\n\nI have been working directly in this space, and the unit economics are stronger than most SaaS businesses if you can secure content partnerships. A regional streaming platform serving a single sport or league in a mid-sized market can achieve profitability within six to twelve months with proper execution. The customer acquisition cost remains relatively low because sports fans actively seek out content for their favorite teams and leagues.\n\nThe challenges are real but manageable. Content acquisition requires relationship building and often revenue-sharing arrangements rather than large upfront payments. The technical infrastructure, while more accessible than before, still requires expertise to implement properly. You need to navigate varying regulations across markets, particularly if you incorporate betting features. Competition exists, but the market remains fragmented enough that focused regional plays can succeed.\n\nFor anyone seriously considering this space, I recommend starting with a single sport or league in a defined geographic market rather than attempting to build a broad platform immediately. Establish partnerships with content owners who currently have no distribution or poor distribution deals. Focus on mobile-first development since that is where consumption is heading globally. Build ad monetization into your core platform from day one rather than treating it as an afterthought.\n\nI have been building solutions in this exact space through my work on sports streaming infrastructure. The technical barriers that once prevented entrepreneurs from entering this market have largely disappeared, which is why we are seeing an explosion of regional platforms globally. If you have relationships with sports content owners or understand a specific market well, this represents one of the most compelling opportunities I have analyzed in the streaming economy.\n\nI am happy to discuss the specifics with anyone exploring this space. What aspects of sports streaming or ad monetization would be most valuable to break down further?",
