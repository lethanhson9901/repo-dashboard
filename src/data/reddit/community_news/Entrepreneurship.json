When you’re clear on what the business is, what problem it solves, and you’re already taking action, people are much more willing to help or collaborate regardless of your age.\n\nA few realistic points:\n\n* Start solo or with one collaborator, not a full team\n* Look for people who want to learn or build together, not employees\n* Be honest about your situation and limits. Serious people respect clarity more than confidence\n* Your age matters less than whether you’re consistent and reliable\n\nTeams usually form around momentum, not ideas. Build something small first. Once others see progress, getting help becomes much easier.",

There’s the money, the responsibility, and learning a whole new business model all at once. But it can also be an amazing way to get into business with a proven system, support network, and structure that really helps you grow.\n\nFrom my experience helping people explore franchise opportunities, the ones who succeed usually pick something that fits their skills, interests, and lifestyle. That alignment makes all the difference between burning out and actually enjoying the journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has done it. If you bought a franchise in your 20s or 30s, would you do it again? What surprised you the most, and what advice would you give to someone thinking about taking the leap now?",

My parents don't have long left and they're still working. It makes me really sad to see keep them working and I can't do anything about it but help pay the bills for our house that's not even under our names. Our house doesn't even have heat or ac so it was really hard trying to stay warm during this winter season. I want to help my parents retired before I'm 30. I want to earn a lot of money as quickly as possible and have them live a comfortable life since they've been working when they were just teens. Is there any wealthy individuals or entrepreneurs that would like to help me? I'm willing to learn and do anything for my parents. I would like to learn under a mentor and learn how to make passive money. I don't really care about earning money for me personally as I don't see the value in materialistic things. I just want to help my parents. Thank you for taking this time to read this essay of a struggling, desperate man. ",

That's why nobody uses terms suggesting there is even slight market demand, such as customer discovery. \n\nDistribution mentality is all push, no market demand pull. Pure and simple, it's a way for neo-maxi-zoom-dweebies to eliminate human nature from software production *to the exclusion of all else.*\n\nAn obligatory survey posting that gets as little as three replies seems sufficient to satisfy the standard Build It And They Will Come venture. People are always posting to ask if three, six, twelve responses -- nobody paid but a moment's attention to fill out -- is enough 'market traction' to launch. They are ridiculous but consistent; I can't remember how long it has been since anybody *claimed to have* even twenty responses. \n\nAnd they didn't seem to see a problem until one dreadful minute of silence after launch. Yet their amazement seemed genuine. Seems getting into tech to avoid human nature sure can be a bitch when you need those bastards to buy your shit. \n\nDistribution is an interesting choice of word, full of meaning and forecasting, well ...profoundly disappointing outcomes. Want a real distribution \"problem?\" Put up a landing page and Buy Now button. If 32,468 people click in a reasonable time -- that's the problem you want to have. And you can bet showing them the money will get code monkeys to flock to your cause. Without real validation, they will focus on their own pointless boondoggles.",

      "text": "So I have my meeting with incubator in this week to pitch my startup idea. If they accept us, the incorporation costs through in5 are way cheaper than going the traditional route. For someone bootstrapping this, that difference actually matters a lot.\n\nBut honestly, I can't sleep. I've rehearsed this maybe 20 times now. I know my market size, I've got my financial projections ready, I understand the competitive landscape. But there's such a huge gap between knowing your material and actually convincing experienced investors that your idea deserves their time. These people at in5 have seen hundreds of startups. They know immediately what's real and what's just wishful thinking.\n\nI keep imagining them asking why this doesn't exist already if it's such a good idea, or what happens when someone like Careem decides to enter this space, or how exactly I plan to acquire customers without burning through cash. And honestly, the scariest question is probably \"why you?\" I have investment banking experience, I understand this market, I've done months of research. But is that actually enough to build this thing?\n\nWhat do these meetings even focus on? Should I lead with the problem or jump straight to our solution? How deep should I go on the technical AI stuff versus keeping it high level? At this stage with no traction yet, are they looking more at the idea itself or trying to evaluate if I'm the right person to execute it?\n\nIf anyone here has pitched to incubators in GCC, what actually matters in that room? Should I just trust that I've prepared enough and be myself, or is there some specific thing these meetings look for that I might be completely missing? Any advice would really help right now.",

          "text": "I haven’t pitched in GCC, but I’ve worked with a few incubators in the region and pitched to investors outside MENA, and had investments for a gig about 2 years back. So hope the following helps!\n\nThe pitching game has definitely evolved, especially in the last 6-12 months. I’m not sure we can really value “code” the way we used to anymore, it’s easier, cheaper, and faster to build now. The real defensibility is in the person (or people) behind it, you! Like a lot of zero-day investors (Antler, etc.), I feel like the yes/no decision mostly comes down to founder-fit at this stage. \n\nSo have faith in yourself. Trust your vision and sell it. Make them believe you are the best person to solve this problem, not that you have the perfect solution. Founders should be in love with the problem, not the solution, because the solution will definitely pivot, change, and improve over time. \n\nAll the very best! Let me know how it goes :)",

      "text": "I have been analyzing the sports streaming market for the past eighteen months, and there is a massive opportunity that most entrepreneurs are completely overlooking. With World Cup 2026 coming to North America and streaming rights fragmenting globally, the barriers to entry have dropped while demand is exploding.\n\nThe major platforms like ESPN+, DAZN, and Paramount+ are fighting over premium rights to tier-one leagues. Meanwhile, there are thousands of regional leagues, college sports networks, amateur competitions, and niche sports that cannot secure favorable distribution deals. These content owners are desperate for streaming solutions but lack the technical infrastructure to launch platforms independently.\n\nHere is what makes this opportunity compelling right now. The technology infrastructure that once required millions in investment and entire engineering teams can now be deployed in weeks rather than months. The core components include live streaming architecture, content delivery networks for global reach, ad insertion technology, mobile applications, and payment processing systems. What previously represented an insurmountable barrier to entry has become accessible through modern platform solutions.\n\nThe revenue model is remarkably straightforward and proven. Ad monetization through pre-roll and mid-roll advertising generates the primary revenue stream, particularly when you can offer local and regional advertisers direct access to engaged sports audiences. Subscription tiers provide recurring revenue, while pay-per-view options work exceptionally well for championship events and premium matchups. Sponsorship overlays and branded content create additional streams, and for those willing to navigate the regulatory complexity, fantasy sports and betting integration can dramatically increase user engagement and lifetime value.\n\nThe timing creates a perfect storm of opportunity. World Cup 2026 will drive unprecedented demand for streaming infrastructure across North America. Emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are experiencing explosive growth in mobile-first streaming consumption. Regional advertisers want access to sports audiences but cannot afford the premium rates that major platforms command. Meanwhile, younger demographics have completely abandoned traditional cable and expect all content to be available on mobile devices.\n\nI have been working directly in this space, and the unit economics are stronger than most SaaS businesses if you can secure content partnerships. A regional streaming platform serving a single sport or league in a mid-sized market can achieve profitability within six to twelve months with proper execution. The customer acquisition cost remains relatively low because sports fans actively seek out content for their favorite teams and leagues.\n\nThe challenges are real but manageable. Content acquisition requires relationship building and often revenue-sharing arrangements rather than large upfront payments. The technical infrastructure, while more accessible than before, still requires expertise to implement properly. You need to navigate varying regulations across markets, particularly if you incorporate betting features. Competition exists, but the market remains fragmented enough that focused regional plays can succeed.\n\nFor anyone seriously considering this space, I recommend starting with a single sport or league in a defined geographic market rather than attempting to build a broad platform immediately. Establish partnerships with content owners who currently have no distribution or poor distribution deals. Focus on mobile-first development since that is where consumption is heading globally. Build ad monetization into your core platform from day one rather than treating it as an afterthought.\n\nI have been building solutions in this exact space through my work on sports streaming infrastructure. The technical barriers that once prevented entrepreneurs from entering this market have largely disappeared, which is why we are seeing an explosion of regional platforms globally. If you have relationships with sports content owners or understand a specific market well, this represents one of the most compelling opportunities I have analyzed in the streaming economy.\n\nI am happy to discuss the specifics with anyone exploring this space. What aspects of sports streaming or ad monetization would be most valuable to break down further?",

Something that requires hand and eye coordination and dexterity.\n\nIf you're playing catch with a friend and you're talking about something you're passionate about, like some video game or something, you flow. You don't stutter or have pregnant pauses or anxiety, you also won't be dropping the ball and throwing poorly.\n\nThe goal is to be as smooth as a gravy sandwich.\n\nRepetition is the mother of all skill. If you prepare, you will overcome the anxieties because passion and reflex will take over.\n\nI used to gather my sales teams every morning before the bell rang. We had an assortment of dexterity based activities from boxing to ping pong. The room would be a murmur of noise of everyone, pitching. And fielding rebuttals and objections, isolating and overcoming, and then back in line with their pitches.\n\nYou also need to believe in whatever you're doing, where you'll never reach the point of being passionate about. I had my son do cold calling for my business kind of as an uncomfortable lesson. Picking up that phone took him almost an hour for the first time. He was like dad this is hard. Then, we worked on his script.He had it memorized because I told him he had to. He even had some of the objections and rebuttals memorized. But he stuttered and stammered, and his tone changed, and i'm warbled, he pregnant paused, he got tripped up if anything unexpected came his way.\n\nThen we started playing catch. I told him imagine that you've got a truckload of playstation 5s. You're your only job is to get rid of them by the end of the day. And you gotta sell them for twenty five dollars, apiece. Could you do it?\n\nHe was like hell yeah that's crazy! \n\nI'm well, that's the equivalent of what my company sells. We provide truck parts that are made with higher grid materials, improved and patented designs that shorten the installation time from forty five minutes down to 5 minutes. The parts are required consumable and universal. They go on every truck on the planet. The best part is we sell them for about 50+% less than anyone else in the world. \n\nPeople would be stupid not to buy my product. I know that, and I make sure they know that. \n\nOnce, he believed in what we were providing and he understood the price matrix. It became selling playstation 5s for $25.\n\nWe practice the script while throwing the ball and laughing and talking. Within an hour or so, he was smooth. He did regress a bit on the phone because his age. He was 14. He wanted to call everyone, sir.And make sure they're having a good day and none of that was in the script. \n\nIn 9 weeks he had landed 27 Southern Tire Mart locations, 15 new Speedco/Loves locations, and 11 independent repair shops. He made a few thousand dollars in commissions up front, and still sees about $75-$450 a month in residual commissions, 2 years later.",
