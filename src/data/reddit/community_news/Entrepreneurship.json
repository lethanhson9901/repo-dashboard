Many of the most successful startups are run by folks who are 45 according to HBR.\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45\n\nPersonally, the best advice I've received is to find something that you really enjoy and then get good at it.  By immersing yourself in a community you are exposed to the problems in that community and can help solve them.  For example, I work with a lot of small to medium size businesses in my day-to-day job and saw that many of them struggle to find smart, confidential experts who can help those business execs brainstorm and evaluate ideas from diverse perspectives. But the solution to that only came from being with people and talking to people all the time.  \n\nGood luck!",

One thing I like to encourage people with, is to really focus on your “why.” \n\nAnyone can jump into being a business owner, but I feel it’s the ones who really discover their “why” will not only have what it takes to push themselves towards success, but also can use their why to pull them out of the hard times and propel them forward. \n\nI would encourage you to check out Simon Sinek and his book Start with Why in part of your discovery process. Lastly, whatever I do, I like to focus on making meaning over money. Every time I follow this path it is great what I accomplish and I always make money along the way, because my passion comes alive! When I focus on how much money I’m going to make, nothing impactful ever is born and definitely no money is made.",

Not because it tells you what business to start, but because it clears up a huge misunderstanding most of us walk into entrepreneurship with.\n\nThe short version is this: being interested in business and being good at a skill are not the same as building a business that works without eating your life. That distinction alone can save years of frustration.\n\nAs for “where to spend time online,” I’d be careful there. A lot of spaces feel productive but mostly keep you consuming instead of building. Books and long-form thinking tend to give a better foundation early on than bouncing between platforms.\n\nCurious what pulled you toward entrepreneurship in the first place.

      "text": "Sitting in on real conversations around small SaaS acquisitions changed a few assumptions I didn’t even realize I had.\n\nI used to think building from scratch was the “clean” option. Blank slate, full control, no mess. Buying felt like inheriting problems. But the more deals I watched, the more it made me think buying might be better than building.\n\nThe problems are there either way. The difference is whether you find them upfront or six months in, when you’re already emotionally and financially committed.\n\nOne thing I keep noticing, people don’t stall because there aren’t enough businesses out there. They stall because they’re everywhere at once. Marketplaces today, cold emails tomorrow, a new niche every week. After a while, everything blurs together and decision-making gets worse.   \n  \nSmart buyers tend to limit their niche down to few businesses which they are good at, this makes you more efficient and does’t waste your time exploring 10 diff niches. \n\nAnother thing, most of the important stuff comes out in conversation before it ever shows up in a spreadsheet. Metrics tell you **what** is happening. Talking to the founder usually tells you **why.** The timing, the burnout, the part of the business they’re tired of carrying, that context often explains the opportunity more than the numbers do.\n\nRevenue matters, obviously. But not as much as whether the product has crossed that invisible line from “side project someone tinkers with” to “something people quietly rely on.” That distinction alone filters out a lot of shiny distractions.\n\nAnd then there’s the part no one really talks about. The slow checks. The verification. The awkward questions. The walking away from deals that looked exciting at first glance.   \n  \nEvery buyer I respect seems to develop a weird tolerance for this stage. It’s not fun, but it’s where most bad decisions get avoided, and this is what you call Due Diligence phase. \n\nNone of this felt obvious until I’d seen a few deals up close, especially the ones that almost happened and probably shouldn’t have.",

For where I live, this is very good money.\n\nThe issue is I’m fully booked. Every new opportunity feels like:\n\n* take it and burn out\n* or say no and feel stuck\n\nThat’s what **pushed** **me** **to** **think** **about** **starting a company** and scaling beyond myself, mostly because I’m worried there’s nothing beyond my personal brand and trading time for money.\n\nBut the more I look at the numbers, the less it makes sense.\n\nA realistic service company in my space probably runs on 20–30% margins. To make the same \\~120k/year I make now as a freelancer, the company would need to do something like 400k–500k in revenue. And that’s **just** **to** ***match*** my income, **not even exceed it**, and obviously I wouldn’t just take all of that out personally. All with way more stress, risk, and management.\n\nAlso:\n\n* My clients hire *me*, not a team\n* I’d still be the bottleneck for sales and quality\n* Selling random products doesn’t feel like a real long term asset or exit\n\n**So now I’m torn:**\n\n1. Double down on freelancing + personal brand\n2. Keep freelancing stable and slowly try to build a company or asset on the side\n\nThe math makes scaling feel kinda crazy, but the idea of having nothing beyond freelancing long term also worries me.\n\nCurious how others have thought about this or what they’d do.",

As you said, you need to be significantly large already to exceed solo freelance income. Overhead eats up a lot of the profit.\n\nSo, either think about a product company you could start. I always encourage people who want that to start it on the side. Sacrifice a few days a week of your freelance job to work on the product company. It will take longer than you think before it brings income.\n\nAlternatively just keep doing what you are doing and buy real estate for passive income.",

For cleaning as a service, the trust factor might be a lot higher bar to cross. Ratings, comments, past experience, maybe background checks would be needed for new customers. Scheduling past cleaners (favorited) would be needed for existing customers. Also, Ubers are quick point to point services. Cleaning takes longer so you would need to be able get people on the ready when a job becomes available. Initially, one approach might be to each out to existing local business that do cleaning as a service and build a campaign that this can increase their business by filling excess downtime. Lastly, the real issue is pay, sales and insurance. How would they be paid, what if they break some thing or theft? Do they do windows?",

The cleaner has a profile and fee and can bid on the cleaning jobs.\n\n\nThe cleaner is paid by homeaglow. I was charging $22 an hour and my Max job was 3 hours. It is high demand, and you are on your own in the house. The client may be there while you're cleaning. It's pretty fast pay for a side hustle/gig.\n\n\nThe only problem is that you go to a house and if you turn it down after you get there, it would affect your ratings. In other words the more you do the more priority that you have from the company. I had to turn down one client and it was so bad that child services should have been called. I didn't have the heart to tell her why I couldn't clean her house. But when I turn down a job I have to explain the reason to the company.\n\n\nThere's another company that also is set up like this and you have to pay for the training and also buy the shirts. However you are your own boss contracted out by the company and you can bid on whatever you want to do.\n\n\nThe problem is that the company's offer specials and you're dealing with a lot of cheap clients.\n\n\nI no longer  consider this as a fallback anymore because I don't think it's safe for me as one person these days, and that's my personal opinion. When you get to the house it's a 50/50 chance it would be decent. I've had requests for no animals but they have dogs who growl and are aggressive. There is money maker but not for me.\n\n\nCleaners have to pay angi and thumbtack.  ",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some realistic advice because I’ve been spinning my wheels a bit trying to get bookkeeping clients.\n\n**Background:**  \nI have a college diploma in accounting and about a year of combined experience (school + \\~9 months as a staff accountant/bookkeeper). I’m not a CPA, and I’m not trying to position myself as one. I’m aiming strictly at **basic bookkeeping** for small businesses (monthly books, reconciliations, cleanup, etc.).\n\n**What I’ve done so far:**\n\n* Set up a simple service offering (monthly bookkeeping, cleanup)\n* Reached out to small businesses locally (cold emails / DMs)\n* Posted in a few Facebook and Reddit groups (mostly ignored or very low response)\n* Talked to people I know personally (some interest, nothing converted)\n* Tried to keep pricing reasonable and transparent\n* I’m confident in my ability to do the work once I actually get a client\n\n**Where I’m struggling:**\n\n* Getting *any* traction or responses\n* People seem hesitant to trust someone without a CPA or years of solo experience\n* Competing with very cheap overseas bookkeepers and very established firms at the same time\n* Feeling like I’m stuck in the “need clients to get experience, need experience to get clients” loop\n\nI’m not expecting instant success or big money. I just want **my first few real clients** so I can build proof, testimonials, and momentum.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Is this just normal early-stage friction, or am I missing something obvious?\n* Where did your *first* bookkeeping clients actually come from?\n* Should I niche down harder (industry, software, cleanup only, etc.)?\n* Is it smarter to work under another firm first before trying solo?\n* Any mistakes you see beginners make that I might be making?\n\nI’m open to blunt feedback. If the answer is “this takes way longer than you think” or “you’re approaching it wrong,” I’d rather hear that now.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share real experiences.",

          "text": "It's definitely a bit of work to get going in the beginning but just keep at it. We started off slow but growth eventually came. Started off as a single bookkeeper offering services to 2 clients and grew into full-time staff and servicing 30+ and doing adhoc \"project\" work often . I said in a previous post that what really helped us branch out is offering totadvi advisory services along with bookkeeping. It helped us upsell to already bookkeeping clients and individually sell totadvi. It's often an over looked product for bookkeepers and the best part is you only pay when your client agrees to accepting the service",

Maybe put together an affordable package where you will help set up the accounting app for new businesses so they can take over their own bookkeeping.  The one-time expense may attract a few clients who know they need the help but don't want to commit to a recurring service. Some may then convert to have you do the bookkeeping once you have the relationship established.",

Yes you'll get a lot of rejection, but I'd be shocked it you didn't fall into 1 or 2 clients. \nThe main problem i see for a of solopreneurs is they lack the desire to do the hardest thing - making sales calls on the phone and in person. Ring 100 business and knock at 100 businesses doors and if you don't find a single customer I guarantee you'll at least have a better understanding of what people want",
