Founders make obvious bad decisions and fight themselves every step of the way. Just to finally figure out supply does not force demand to manifest automagically. Dull instincts for survival need to be honed. \n\nIt's not the struggle, it's the completely avoidable boring problems wantrepreneurs wallow in that sucks.

Note: Do not try to sell on the first call - it won't work.  \n2. Built relationships. Would strongly suggest that you get to know your local businesses - they all belong to similar organizations/clubs  and know each other - we began to receive regular referrals.  \n3. Niched down into a specific industry. Marketing, messaging, and referrals became much easier.  \n4. Stopped selling websites. Most business owners do not care about websites. They care about solutions and results so instead, my agency sold 'Marketing Solutions' (Packaged several services together to get them to the end result).\n\nOnce you get your process, offers and experience locked-in it will become easier to scale with partners, affiliates, and other complimentary businesses.\n\n  \nHope this helps!",

We are a small startup here in (\"Name of city\") and I'm reaching out to other business owners in the area to talk about (eg. \"Getting more foot traffic or how their getting customers - what's working or not\") --or -- I'm hoping to set up a quick call with you to talk about (\"Benefit you provide to common problem\").

Many of the most successful startups are run by folks who are 45 according to HBR.\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45\n\nPersonally, the best advice I've received is to find something that you really enjoy and then get good at it.  By immersing yourself in a community you are exposed to the problems in that community and can help solve them.  For example, I work with a lot of small to medium size businesses in my day-to-day job and saw that many of them struggle to find smart, confidential experts who can help those business execs brainstorm and evaluate ideas from diverse perspectives. But the solution to that only came from being with people and talking to people all the time.  \n\nGood luck!",

Lastly, whatever I do, I like to focus on making meaning over money. Every time I follow this path it is great what I accomplish and I always make money along the way, because my passion comes alive!

Not because it tells you what business to start, but because it clears up a huge misunderstanding most of us walk into entrepreneurship with.\n\nThe short version is this: being interested in business and being good at a skill are not the same as building a business that works without eating your life. That distinction alone can save years of frustration.\n\nAs for “where to spend time online,” I’d be careful there. A lot of spaces feel productive but mostly keep you consuming instead of building. Books and long-form thinking tend to give a better foundation early on than bouncing between platforms.\n\nCurious what pulled you toward entrepreneurship in the first place.

I’ve given talks at Websummit, VivaTech, IGS, AWE and taught classes or gave workshops on colleges and universities.\n\nBut right now I’m facing some really tough times.\n\nInvestment (which I finally turned too) is taking too long to materialize and each day that goes through, the hole I’m in gets deeper and with 3 kids that’s not something you want.\n\nSo that’s why I’m turning to you all for help.\n\nAll I want is a shot to work my way out of this hole and I’ve got a lot of wisdom and experience building and marketing all kinds of technology as well as living and bootstrapping as an Entrepreneur and I’m available to share it all with you.\n\nSo if you want to know how to build things well or fast or performative, how to make tech stacks cheaper (I’m really good at finding cheaper alternatives), how to market something, how to price it, how to make a good pitchdeck (i worked with a lot of startups in the past for this), how to make a good presentation, how to speak at an event, or just have a conversation and vent about the VC ecosystem or what not to do as startup, PLEASE LET’S TALK and make that time worth for both of us.\n\nAs I said, all I want is a shot to work my way out of this and I have faith in the brotherhood/sisterhood that is the Startup Community and that you will help me.\n\nThank you for your time and may all your businesses prosper!",

Learned it for 2 months and stopped due to over saturated market, fierce competition, ai replacement and so on and on.    \nOn the top of that literally every programmer I talked to said to me - don't start learning coding, it's a dead sphere ,you won't be able to find a job. But my final goal is to scale my skill to a business. And when they hear this they always say then you definitely shouldn't start coding. Freelance is dead in IT and so is job market.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is coding still worth learning if one wants to scale this skill to a profitable business? If not, then what speheres are better to consider choosing? I made a post on boring businesses not a long time ago. Honestly I'm not interested in them at all. So, what do you think? Thx. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.\n\n**The idea:**\n\nInstead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  \nA company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.\n\nSo if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.\n\nThe thinking is that this channel is:  \n• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  \n• Hyper-targeted by location  \n• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  \n• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)\n\n**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  \nA) A serious marketing channel  \nB) A gimmick  \nC) Something brands would only test at a small scale\n\nMy questions:\n\n👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  \n• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  \n• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  \n• How would you measure success?  \n• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?\n\n👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  \n• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  \n• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?\n\nI’m especially interested in hearing from:  \n• Media buyers  \n• Brand managers  \n• Growth marketers  \n• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns\n\nBrutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

              "text": "Well that's the ultimate question for sure. Not sure if that's a literal question or if you are questioning if it's financially viable. In the literal sense - the business model, in theory (not proven or validated yet), is that businesses would pay for x amount of coffee cups to be printed and distributed with their brand and QR code/CTA on the coffee cup - the price of which would be higher than what it costs to print and distribute the cups - which results in profit (apologise if you didn't mean your question in the literal sense). \n\nIf you are questioning if it's financially viable, I have no idea - that's what I'm trying to figure out. This is very very early idea stage, so I'm speaking with as many people as I can to see if I can invalidate the idea before anything else. But it's reaching the point where we'll have to do a real-world test and see how it stacks up. Maybe this medium has a huge conversation and offers huge ROI opportunity for companies - I have no idea, it probably won't, but I don't have any data or insights to validate or invalidate that. \n\nBut I do absolutely take your point around being an inferior medium, and I agree, I think it is, but I guess it depends on the business/industry and a whole bunch of other factors. Nonetheless, I really appreciate your feedback and giving your opinion - it's helping me massively in terms of shaping (or binning) the idea - thank you!",

But people into brand development are into vanity metrics and this could work for that infamous phrase \"Who cares about sales ...it's building *the brand*.\"\n\nAny pitch you can crowbar 'brand awareness' into might work. Brand developers are a delusional bunch.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't new ... nobody has any reason to even bother to consult with you. They'll partner, then send whatever materials to the supplier of that partner. In other words you are an intermediary on the ultimate disintermediation platform, a middleman without a meaningful purpose.\n\nFor anybody unaware, large brands already have marketing employees whose only job is to justify their existence at the corporation's expense. It's called overhead. And you shouldn't aspire to be an overhead cost.",
