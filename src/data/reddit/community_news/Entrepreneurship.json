      "text": "This might be unpopular here, but I need to vent about something. For years I was that guy. You know the one - trying to build \"the next big thing,\" chasing passion projects, reading about disruption and innovation, pitching investors on half-baked SaaS ideas. Spent 3 years burning through savings on startups that went nowhere. Then I did something that felt like giving up: started a moving company. Unglamorous. Unsexy. Zero VC interest. Just trucks, boxes, and manual labor.\n\nAaand. It's been the best business decision I ever made.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about \"boring\" businesses - they print money if you're even marginally competent. Why? Because your competition is usually terrible at the basics.\n\nWhen I started, I looked around at other moving companies in my area. These guys were running businesses like it's 1995. Awful websites, no SEO, competing purely on being the cheapest, zero customer follow-up. It was like shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nI did nothing revolutionary. Just ran it like an actual business. Got proper marketing set up - worked with a marketing team (in my case it was [mover marketing AI](https://www.movermarketing.ai)) just to rank in Google's Map Pack, implemented a real CRM, trained staff properly, had decent branding, followed up on quotes, charged what we're worth instead of racing to the bottom on price. That's it. No innovation. No disruption. Just competence.\n\nAfter 18 months I've got:  \n\\- Six figures annual revenue  \n\\- 22% profit margins  \n\\- Work maybe 25 hours/week now  \n\\- Sleeping great at night (no investor pressure, no burn rate anxiety)\n\nI learned that \"Follow your passion\" is terrible advice for most people. You know what I'm passionate about now? Financial freedom. Time with my family. Not stressing about runway or product-market fit. The moving business gave me that. My \"passion project\" SaaS ideas gave me anxiety and credit card debt.\n\nSure, I'm not going to be a unicorn founder. I'm not changing the world. But I'm making great money, have actual work-life balance, and own 100% of something profitable. That beats the hell out of chasing Silicon Valley fantasies.\n\nAnyone else ditch the \"sexy\" startup dream for something boring and profitable? Or am I just coping hard?",

I had an idea for a bottle that closed when you put it down but that was a long time ago lol.\n\nFocus on being able to very easily operate it, one handed without looking by testing it on people who have never tried it and then after they struggle let you see them do it once but no more times. Gotta have it be intuitive.\n\nEdit edit:  If you’re interested in bouncing ideas around I’ve brought a couple successful products to market from idea to packaged item in store (successful enough that I live a comfortable life off of them) and I’d be happy to just chat about stuff because I think it’s really cool. Injection molding does not have to be as expensive as you think it might be and also there are other ways to make a product real in ways that are not necessarily injection molding and might offer more value to a customer base that might define the customer base more suited to an injection molded product.\n\nEdit edit edit: of course no strings attached if you bounce any ideas off of me. I don’t believe in the say word get a third concept. It’s your idea and I just thought it was cool.",

Hope this can help others too that share the same frustrations.\n\nPs: Do Not give up! ;)",

Some days consistency means 8 focused hours, but on other days, it means 20 minutes on one meaningful task. And it's important to know that both count.\n\nI also stop trying to push through all the time and shrink the task until it's almost stupidly small. So instead of “grow the startup,” try to “send one email,” or “write one paragraph,” or “fix one thing.” Momentum usually comes after you start, not before.\n\nAnd I also zoom out and why it feels heavy. Sometimes it's because of fear, or lack of certainty, or not seeing the results yet. Naming it has helped me so I can restructure instead of pushing through. Sometimes that means a short break, or changing the plan, or reducing scope so it feels doable again. \n\nFor me, consistency isn't about the grind every day; it's about finding a rhythm I can live with and keep up, and yeah, now and again, there's grinding and pushing through because you have to at times.",

      "text": "As the year is wrapping up, I figured I’d share my thoughts from a quite eventful first year (8 months) as an entrepreneur. \n\nMy co-founder and I are 25 years old and have worked at Series A-C startups as team leads within SWE and Quant Research. \n\nWe started building on our idea in late April, 2025, after identifying a problem that both of us faced. By July, we had a prototype of the consumer app ready. We got around 25 of our friends to try it out over a month and give feedback. Based on the feedback, we iterated core features and derived our solution for the problem we identified. \n\nWe applied on the last day to the F25 batch, and 3 days later, we received an invitation to interview with YC in-person. As you can imagine, our adrenaline was pumping and we felt like we were on top of the world. Imagine having built a prototype in a few months as a first time entrepreneur and now the most prestigious incubator flies you out to San Francisco for an interview.\n\nFast forward to after the interview. We felt it went fantastic. However, 2 days later, we got an email from YCombinator.. I am not going to cover the feedback, but that was a reality check. Getting rejected sucks. I lost a few nights of sleep over it.\n\nWe had spent time networking and casually pitching our ideas. Not with the intent of raising capital, but instead to practice and learn. This led to some early interest. And the week after we got rejected from YCombinator, another early stage VC firm offered to fund us $100,000 for 10% of the company. Something we rejected because we didn’t think they were the right investors for our product. And since we can bootstrap longer, why not do it? \n\nYC gave us feedback that they liked us and our idea, but would like to see some early and enthusiastic users to strengthen the application. Which set the product roadmap until the end of the year: get early enthusiastic users on the app and have it ready for launch. \n\nAt this point, I was ready to quit my job. I talked to my boss, who asked for a transition period until the end of the year (3-4 months). I agreed, but told them I need to be working remotely most days. I helped offboard my responsibilities, hire a replacement, and onboard the replacement. \n\nWith our roadmap until the end of the year, we started working on the MVP. Once ready, we began in-person onboarding and interviews (around 1hr). We conducted 1-3 per week. All early users were friends or people from our networks. This helped us reach 50 users and iterate the product to where it is today.  \n\nAlong with this, we started in December to do content by posting on Reddit and Linkedin. Attempting to engage in communities either building, solving, or dealing with problems that our product solves or could solve in the future. This has led to organic daily visitors on our website, a waitlist that has grown into the triple digits, and over 100k views a week on our content. \n\nReflecting back on the year, it is incredible how much I have learnt and grown. From what felt like early success, to rejection, to difficult decisions, and now a product that I am incredibly proud of and is showing tangible value for our testers. \n\nOne thing I take away from the year is that the more I learn, the more I realize I have no idea what I am doing. \n",

A few thoughts that might be useful:\n- The way you iterated with friends and early users is gold. Early enthusiastic feedback is exactly what YC and other investors often look for, so keep that momentum going.\n- Your approach to community content (Reddit/LinkedIn) is smart. One tip is to tie each post to measurable actions even subtle ones like waitlist signups, demo requests, or email clicks. That way you’re learning not just engagement, but tangible interest.\n- You mentioned organic daily visitors and a waitlist - have you considered using small, targeted experiments to see what type of content drives the most enthusiastic signups? For example, posts that explicitly highlight a problem vs posts showing the solution. The difference can reveal which messaging resonates best for your early adopters.\n\nCurious, looking at the waitlist and engagement, have you noticed a pattern in who your most enthusiastic users are? And how are you thinking about turning that early traction into the next phase of growth?",

I resonated so deeply with all those things because i came from practically nothing. the only thing i really had going for me was to work hard and to hope that my hard work would pay off.\n\nand honestly?? while that's partially true, it's more misleading than it is useful advice. the first eye-opener for me was when my professor told me to 'think like a business'. it didn't make sense to me what he meant until at least 3 years later, and i still blew it. from 2018 to 2023 i thought that thinking like a business meant learning every detailed nuance of every single job so that when i get 'to the top', i'd have a better understanding and empathy for everyone who'd work for me in the future. while this felt like a noble approach, it ran me and my business to the ground, but hey, it's part of the journey of becoming.\n\nanyways, here are the 3 truths i had to learn the hard way to stop spiraling in this endless grind and ACTUALLY operate like a business where I can actually be of use and be of service in a more impactful way:\n\n* **Empathy isn't Expertise:** You don’t need to know how to do everyone’s job to be a good leader. In fact, the more time you spend learning their \"how,\" the less time you spend on your \"why.\" Mastery of tasks is the enemy of mastery of scale.\n* **The \"Broken\" Mindset stays Broken:** If you keep grinding like you’re broke once you start seeing success, you will keep making \"desperation moves\" instead of \"strategic moves.\" You end up making decisions based on fear of loss rather than room for growth.\n* **Systems > Sweat:** \"Thinking like a business\" doesn't mean working harder; it means building a machine that works *without* you. If the machine breaks the second you stop sweating, you didn't really build a business, you just built a very stressful hobby.\n\nThough i grinded for 5 years and ran myself to the ground, it really took me 10 years of deep thought to realize this and i wish i had known sooner.\n\nHas anyone else fallen into the \"Noble Trap\" of trying to do everything yourself? What are some ways you are practicing of letting it go?",

If you've intentionally designed your life to be the heartbeat of the business because it brings you joy, finding that JOY is the true achievement of visionary success. \n\nI'm curious, how long have you been in business for, and what has sustaining yourself through this self-ran business look like for you outside of just working?",

They think silence is death. But to a sophisticated buyer, constant noise actually signals **insecurity**. It screams, \"I need your attention to survive.\"\n\nQuiet Branding is actually just **Signal Precision**.\n\nWhen a brand speaks less, but every word lands with heavy impact, it triggers a different psychological mechanism: **The Credibility Trigger**. It implies, *\"We are so confident in our product that we don't need to chase you.\"*\n\nIt feels counterintuitive because we are trained to measure success by views. But quiet brands aren't optimizing for views; they are optimizing for **resonance**. They don't want 1,000 tourists; they want 10 believers.\n\n**Question:** Think about the quiet brands you admire. Do they feel silent to you, or do they just feel uncluttered? (There is a big difference between saying nothing and simply not saying anything stupid).",

      "text": "So I’m going into my last year of high school and I want to set up the foundation of a business before going into college. The idea is to have a bit of money and something real to work with once I’m there.\n\nI’ve tried a few different ideas already and realised I should probably do something I actually know about, so I’ve decided on starting an \"education based business\". A few years ago, a guy who used to go to my school came back and talked about how he scaled his tuition business to six figures while he was in first year college. He basically hired high-scoring classmates and students from nearby schools as tutors.\n\nAcademically I’m doing well, so for anyone who’s going to say focus on school, dw that’s already a priority - but the thing is I gotta get this business stuff right so I don't waste time (which is where I could use some of y'alls guidance). There’s clearly a big demand for tutoring, especially from Asian parents, I can relate to that, but I don’t really want to start straight with tutoring right now cause tbh I don't really know how to - I mean I do have some friends who are first year college students who scored well on their exams but yeah....\n\nAtm its still early-stage. I’ve been making free guides on how to do well in my curriculum just to build some brand awareness. The curriculum I’m targeting is international, so I can reach students worldwide, not just locally. Even though I haven’t graduated yet, I still think there’s value in sharing what I’ve learned and turning that into guides and resources.\n\nI’ve also made a basic website and store using Payhip and I’m trying to promote it through Instagram and TikTok. \n\nBasically I’m asking how I should tackle this at my stage. What should I focus on, what should I avoid, and how do I turn this into something that’s actually worthwhile?",

At your stage, I wouldn’t rush into hiring tutors yet. The leverage is in clarity + positioning, not scale. Students don’t pay for guides, they pay for confidence before exams. Parents pay for reduced anxiety.\n\nA cleaner progression usually looks like:\n1. Very specific outcome-based resources (not “how to do well”, but “how to get from X to Y in this curriculum”)\n2. Proof through your own process + small wins from others\n3. Only then layering tutoring or cohort-style support\n\n\nQuick questions:\nWho’s actually buying right now: students or parents?\nWhat’s the single exam or bottleneck everyone in your curriculum panics about?\nAre your TikToks driving curiosity or just information?\n\nIf you want, I can help you map this into a simple path that doesn’t waste your time or lock you into tutoring too early.",

          "text": "Hey, really thoughtful post. You’re asking the right questions way earlier than most people do, which already puts you ahead.\n\nI want to reinforce one thing first, because a lot of people will try to talk you out of it. You do not need to have graduated or be some kind of expert to create value. If you’re one step ahead of someone else, you can help them. That’s how tutoring and education businesses have always worked.\n\nThat said, here’s the hard truth that will save you a lot of wasted time.\n\n“Brand awareness” is a trap at your stage.\n\nRight now, nobody is buying because they know your brand. They buy because you solve a very specific, emotionally charged problem. Until you’re clear on that, posting content and building guides just feels productive without actually being productive.\n\nThe biggest decision you need to make is this:\n\nAre you talking to students, or are you talking to parents?\n\nStudents consume content.\nParents pay.\n\nThose are two very different audiences with different fears, different language, and different motivations. If you try to speak to both at once, your message will stay vague and weak.\n\nStudents care about,Passing exams, Stress and Feeling behind their peers\n\nParents care about, their child falling behind, university outcomes, regret and guilt if they “don’t do enough”\n\nIf your goal is eventually turning this into something real and sustainable, parents are almost certainly the economic buyer. That doesn’t mean you ignore students, but it does mean your positioning should be clear in your own head.\n\nAnother thing I’d challenge: going international this early may actually slow you down. Local demand is easier to understand, easier to test, and easier to validate. Scale comes after proof, not before it.\n\nIf I were in your position, I’d focus on three things only for the next phase:\n\n1.Pick one narrow problem in one subject or exam and become known for that.\n\t\n2.Talk to the buyer’s pain, not just the learner’s experience.\n\t\n3.Use content to demonstrate clarity and empathy, not to look impressive.\n\nYou’re absolutely right that there’s value in sharing what you’ve learned. Just make sure you’re sharing it with the person who actually feels the pain strongly enough to act.\n\nYou’re on the right track. Tightening the focus is what turns effort into momentum.",

If you’re a new brand with no established reputation, a small review count, and a limited budget, building trust can feel like the most challenging part.\n\nCurious to know how others think about this. From a customer’s perspective, what actually makes you trust a new or unknown brand? Is it reviews, social proof, transparency, pricing, or how the brand communicates?\n\nAnd for founders or marketers here, what strategies have you seen work early on? Do you focus on a small group of loyal customers first, or try to build visibility quickly across platforms?\n\nWith so much noise online, Would love to hear what genuinely cuts through and makes people feel confident enough to take that first step with a new brand.",

The next step is focusing on consistent, skill-based income rather than chasing “one-hit” wins. A few ideas:\n1. Freelancing / service-based work: Your age isn’t a barrier if you have skills. Think content creation, design, coding, video editing, or even simple online admin tasks. Platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, or Reddit communities can help you find consistent gigs.\n2. Micro-SaaS or digital products: Small tools, templates, guides, or apps aimed at niche problems can generate passive revenue once set up. Start extremely lean validate demand before building.\n3. Content + personal brand: Start a YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok channel teaching what you know or sharing your journey. Even small, consistent growth can turn into consulting, sponsorships, or digital product sales.\n4. Invest in learning high-income skills: Copywriting, digital marketing, automation, or programming. Focus on mastery of one skill you can monetize it quickly and repeatedly.\n\nOne key mindset: focus on small, repeatable wins rather than trying to hit six figures overnight. Compound those wins, and you’ll build real financial freedom over time. Curious, out of all your previous attempts, which skills or knowledge stuck with you that you could actually leverage now? That’s usually the quickest path to real income.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm a mid 30s Canadian looking for some advice on starting a resume writing, interview coaching & career coaching business.\n\nAs a background, I'm a mid-senior level Electrical Engineer who has moved around quite a bit and been able to easily find work in both the government and private sector all across the country. I have also had the opportunity to work in one of the FAANG companies in the US (not software engineer, more utilities side for datacentres as I'm an Elec Eng.) which are known as tough roles to interview for and attain. In all fairness that big tech interview was tough and exhausting.\n\nRecently my peers and I have noticed that I can easily find good and meaningful work so I had the idea to start an all in one career coaching, resume writing, interview coaching side business as I think I have a successful Canadian engineering career and do well with resumes and interviews (I usually find that if interview with a place, I get the job).\n\nI also liked mentoring my interns at previous jobs and had a great sense of satisfaction when they would come back to me and say things like \"thanks for your advice\" or \"thanks for your help with my resume I think it helped me get my first job\". Of course, I'm not sure how I would measure this but it is still a good feeling to help someone out and things work out.\n\nI am an engineer full time at a municipal utility currently and like the job, so I would not like to give that up as it also comes with a indexed to inflation pension after 25 years of service. This business would be a part time side hustle as I never have to work overtime or weekends and work load in municipal government is quite low. I feel like this idea is probably is more useful than playing video games and netflix all weekend !\n\nAll jokes aside, I never thought I'd want to start a business in my 20s and early 30s and just wanted to be a worker but I would like to explore this idea a bit more. It also couldn't hurt to have some extra income !\n\nTo be honest I feel like business is not promoted or explored in school here so I have no idea where to start. I also feel like i'm at a defecit as I never went to school for business or have an MBA so I wonder what starting a business is like in Canada, what the legalities are and how I would measure success.\n\nI have been looking on youtube but its more how to scale not how to start. Would be greatful for any advice or insight !",

          "text": "You’re actually in a much stronger position than you think. Hard truth first: this doesn’t need to be a “business” in the MBA sense to work. It needs to be a paid problem-solving service with clear boundaries so it doesn’t eat your life or risk your pension job. A few grounded points, based on what you wrote:\n\nFirst, your credibility is real and rare in Canada. Canadian engineering hiring is very different from US tech influencer advice. You’ve: moved across provinces, worked public + private, passed a FAANG-style process, consistently converted interviews into offers. That alone already differentiates you from generic career coaches who’ve never hired or been hired in those systems. You’re not selling motivation you’re selling pattern recognition.\n\nSecond, don’t start as “resume + interview + career coaching.” That’s too broad and turns you into a commodity. A tighter starting angle could be something like: “Helping Canadian engineers land interviews and offers in utilities, government, and large orgs.” Why this matters: You know the hiring constraints, unions, HR filters, and interview style. People in this niche actively struggle with resumes and interviews. They trust someone who’s already inside the system. You can always expand later. Narrow first.\n\nThird, measuring success early is simple (and not fluffy). Ignore vanity metrics. Track: How many conversations turn into paid sessions. Whether clients get more interviews after resume changes. Whether they pass interviews they were previously failing Even 5-10 clear wins = validation.\n\nFourth, legally and structurally, keep it boring.\nIn Canada, starting small usually looks like: Sole proprietorship, Separate bank account, Simple invoice, Declare income at tax time. You don’t need an MBA, a brand, or a website on day one. You need 3–5 paying clients and proof people will pay you for this.\n\nFifth, your first clients should not come from “marketing.” They should come from: past interns, coworkers’ networks, LinkedIn posts framed as advice (not selling), engineering subreddits or forums with specific guidance. Example angle that works better than promotion: “Here’s what I’ve seen Canadian engineering resumes get rejected for even with good experience.” That attracts the right people.\n\nBefore giving you more concrete next steps, two important questions that will shape everything:\n1. Who do you most want to help first: new grads, mid-level engineers stuck, or people trying to move into government / utilities / big orgs?\n2. Realistically, how many hours per week are you willing to give this without it impacting your main job or quality of life?\n\nAnswer those, and I can help you turn this into a clean, low-risk side business instead of an overwhelming startup.",

I'd like to help anyone I can. \n\n\nIf I had to choose in terms of engineering, I could probably help people up to the senior level as I have been a hiring manager or sat on interview panels at that level, as well as experienced that level of interview on the interviewee side. I probably wouldn't be effective at executive/c-suite level hiring as I'm not quite there yet. It would probably be most satisfying to help new grads since they have the experience disadvantage.\n\n\nI do think I could help with other than STEM fields as well and wouldnt want to be limited to that. I actually have a working background in law enforcement/investigation, transportation and sales as well (haha I liked to try different things in my youth).\n\n\nIn terms of time commitment I'm thinking weekend mornings and maybe one or two weeknights if needed. I actually used to be a security guard part time while I was a junior engineer with City of Toronto and could comfortably do 8 to 16 hrs a week.",
