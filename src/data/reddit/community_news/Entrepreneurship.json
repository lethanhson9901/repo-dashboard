      "text": "Hello, I'm new to this, so forgive me if I'm not very specific or if I ramble a little, a friend just recommended do this to me 😂. \nI am 30 years old, from Havana, Cuba. I am from the new private sector on the island. My business is bringing merchandise from abroad (containers) and sell it here. I bring them through a partner from Panama. \nWe have already brought in some containers of cement and they have sold well. \nI have a friend who brings 40 containers of rice a month and he does excellent. So I want to expand and bring food, you must understand that this is a necessity on the island because the internal production of food is very bad, there is excessive regulation in agriculture, so importing food is essential now. \nI have good contacts in the private sector and am putting together what I believe is a good distribution network. \nWhat I'm looking for is advice, mentors, investors, friends, whatever 😂. In order to expand my financial capacity, vision, collaboration, etc. \nI would also like someone who could give me advice on products that can be entered into the current Cuban market (keep in mind that it is a subsistence market). I want to buy new warehouses, prices here are quite cheap today. \nThe more support the better, I have many friends in Cuba but few friends outside. \nI am quite ambitious and I sincerely believe that I can dominate part of the market with some time and my goal is also to position myself for the next Cuba that will come, which God wants to be soon. \nI consider that I have a good business model with good ROI and many growth opportunities. Something that was difficult in this country. Everything with sanity and little by little because I don't like to rush. Any comments are obviously welcome and greetings to the community, this is exciting 😂. ",

      "text": "My first ever online sale was a tiny fishing rod that folded into your pocket.\n\nThe ads were hilarious guys pulling out these ridiculous little rods and landing massive fish. The reel was decent. The rod was garbage. I wasn't proud of selling it, and I quit pretty fast.\n\nBut I remember the sound. That little *ting* from the Shopify notification. First sale. Wasn't even profitable. Didn't matter. I was hooked. That sound rewired my brain.\n\nThat was about 10 years ago. Since then I've built 4 businesses. Here's the unfiltered version.\n\n**The content machine**\n\nAfter the fishing rod disaster, I started creating content about making money online. No audience, no money, no plan. Just a Facebook group and a phone.\n\nI posted every day. Grew a YouTube channel to 160K subs. Built a Telegram community that hit 35,000 people. Created 230 online courses over a few years.\n\nTotal revenue: around €5M. Margins: \\~80%.\n\nI was basically a one-man operation printing money. But here's what I don't tell people often: I burned through that audience. We went for short-term cashflow instead of building a real community. Hit and run. I was young, it was my first real business, and I optimized for cash instead of lifetime value. If I could go back, I'd build the community-first approach I understand now. Lesson learned the expensive way.\n\n**The million-euro Telegram message**\n\nFlushed with confidence, I built a crypto company. Grew it to 60 employees. We were launching our own token and hired the best team in the space, the guys who had done the biggest launches.\n\nWe sent them €1,000,000 for the liquidity pools. Launch day comes. 2,000 people on the livestream. Countdown hits. 18:00. Nothing. 18:05. Nothing. 18:10. Nothing.\n\nI'm trying to call them. No answer. Messaging on Telegram. No answer. My co-founder is looking at me. 2,000 people are watching. And all I can think is: we just got scammed out of a million euros.\n\nMy hands were shaking. Not the metaphorical \"entrepreneur stress\" kind. Actually shaking.\n\nIt got resolved eventually. They hadn't scammed us; they'd just completely dropped the ball. We found an arrangement, relaunched, and made it work. But the company that was supposed to be our strongest link turned out to be our weakest. And for about 45 minutes, I genuinely thought I'd lost everything.\n\nI sold that company eventually. Good exit. And the Monday after the deal closed, I had nothing to do. No team. No fires. Nothing. Turns out selling a company feels less like a victory and more like an identity crisis with a nice bank balance.\n\n**The beautiful money pit**\n\nNow I'm in Lisbon running a lead gen agency Meta Ads, with multiple verticals, €10M+ in ad spend managed, and €45M+ generated for clients. The agency runs at about a 90% margin. That part works great.\n\nBut I also built a 200m² podcast studio here. It's gorgeous. I host clients, throw events, and run community meetups. I love it. And it's been losing money for 2 years straight.\n\nI've asked myself a hundred times if I should shut it down. On paper, it makes zero sense. But it's my first physical business, and there's something about having a space where people walk in and say \"this is incredible\" that no Stripe dashboard will ever give you.\n\nCall it a trophy asset. Call it ego. Maybe both. But I keep it running.\n\n**The scary one**\n\nNow I'm building a SaaS. AI-powered video content at scale solves a problem I lived every day in the agency. I AM the target customer.\n\nAnd this one scares me. Not because I doubt the product. But because for the first time, I can't just close a client or launch a course to make money next week. It's build, ship, learn, repeat. No shortcuts.\n\nBut honestly? I'm not worried about failure. If this doesn't work, I kill it fast and move on. That's the one thing 10 years taught me: fail fast or bleed slow. The studio is proof that I'm still learning that lesson.\n\nWhat I actually have now, that I didn't have at 24 with my fishing rod ads, is skills that compound no matter what happens. I know AI better than 99% of people in my industry. I know paid media. I know community building. The vehicle might change. The engine doesn't.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about being 4 businesses deep: starting over doesn't get easier. It gets scarier. You have more to lose. More people watching. More ego on the line. But the clarity gets sharper. You stop chasing revenue and start chasing the right problems.\n\nSo here's what I want to ask you, and I mean it:\n\n**What's the moment that rewired YOUR brain? The fishing-rod moment, the shaking-hands moment, the \"this makes no sense but I can't stop\" moment. What was yours?**\n\nI'd love to hear it.",

For me it was chasing different business models, always moving to the next thing instead of sticking with what actually worked. Took me way too long to realize I wasn't building anything real, just collecting ideas.\n\nHere's what I'm noticing though. You've got this pattern of optimizing for the wrong thing. First it was cash over community. Now it's maybe ego over sustainability with the studio. The SaaS scares you because you can't control it the same way, can't just pivot when it gets hard. But honestly? That constraint might be exactly what you need. Sometimes the best growth happens when we can't just bail and start something new.\n\nYou asked about the rewiring moment. Mine was realizing that all my hustle and learning meant nothing without consistency and direction. I had access to hundreds of courses, knew all these models, but I was scatterbrained as hell. The real shift came when I stopped chasing what looked exciting and started asking what actually mattered to me long term. For you, sounds like maybe that studio is trying to tell you something about what you actually value beyond the numbers.",

It scares me a bit because I can’t just pivot every time it gets uncomfortable. It forces me to stay. To commit. To grow up a little.\n\nThe studio isn’t just ego though.

It feels like the \"apply\" button is just a black hole.\n\nIf you’re a founder or an agency owner here:\n\n1. Is the market actually this saturated, or are companies just overwhelmed by low-quality AI applications that they’ve stopped looking at the real talent?\n\n2.

Founders and hiring managers often hire through their network long before a role is fully public. Reaching out directly with a short, tailored message about how you would move revenue or fix a specific gap can sometimes cut through faster than a polished application.   \nThe market is crowded, but it’s also overwhelmed.

One key insight is that marketing goes far beyond simply posting on social media.\n\nIf you want your SaaS product to succeed, it needs a distinctive quality something that sets it apart from competitors. Beyond that, smart positioning and bold communication matter. On platforms like Twitter or X, being witty, sharp, and occasionally provocative can help generate word-of-mouth if done strategically and within limits.\n\nSometimes, brands gain attention by briefly challenging or playfully critiquing larger companies. When done cleverly, this can spark conversations and visibility. Another powerful tactic is creating curiosity and FOMO (fear of missing out), which encourages people to explore your product.\n\nA well-known example is Bumble. In its early days, it relied on creative grassroots marketing strategies to gain traction. The team reportedly used campus ambassador programs and community-based promotion to build exclusivity and buzz among college students. These kinds of stunts helped generate attention without requiring massive advertising budgets.\n\nThe main takeaway is this: Learn to create stunts which are cost afforable to you and your company because getting idea and making idea is easy but getting popular is difficult.\n\ni hope this message helps you ",

I've tried a million different business models and the pattern I noticed is this: when you don't pick one channel and actually see it through, you never learn what really works.

For a B2C job platform, you need to be where job seekers already are when they're frustrated. That's probably not LinkedIn (that's B2B). Could be Reddit (like right now), could be specific Facebook groups, could be content that ranks for long tail job search problems. Pick the one that feels most natural to you because here's the thing: you have to be consistent for months before you see real traction. If you hate the channel, you won't stick with it.\n\nTest one deeply before you even think about adding another. Give it 90 days of real effort. Track one metric.

On paper it was perfect. But during that time, a slow depression crept in, personal life, identity stuff, family pressure, and I started questioning everything. Including the career, I spent 4 years studying.\n\nI’ve always been more creative and entrepreneurial. Started a small handcrafted fragrance brand that got into the biggest mall in Ontario. Did all the branding and marketing myself. It wasn’t anything crazy but an accomplishment nonetheless. I hit a breaking point where my mental health got so bad I basically burned my life down to the ground and impulsively quit my job, and decided to try pursuing this business idea.\n\nMom found out because I was suddenly… happy. Panic ensued. I was bombarded about resume gaps and ruined futures. I folded. Applied to teacher’s college and ended up having daily panic attacks. It was a full-body “no.” I fell into an even darker place mentally.\n\nSo to get out of that I ended up back in my original field in a government role. And everytime someone asks what I do the response is always “you're set for life” and it makes me nauseous.\n\nI can literally see 40 years ahead and I don’t like what I see AT ALL. \n\nOver the last year I rebuilt my savings, moved out to downtown Toronto to reset my environment, and found Pilates. Something I didn’t expect would be my next venture, but I’ve never felt more aligned. It feels like a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIn the year and a half I’ve been in this corporate job:\n\n* Got certified in Pilates\n* Made Pilates the top fitness program at my YMCA in 3 months of being certified\n* Rebuilt my savings after burning my life to the ground a year prior\n* Signed a lease and finally moved out of my parents house into my own condo in Toronto.\n* Got hired at a major Pilates studio in Toronto\n* Launched an online Pilates community\n* Had a TikTok bring in 200+ leads, 50 conversions - proof of concept\n\nIt feels aligned. I can see the vision clearly and oddly so do others (my parents included - but to them just as a side income thing)  And the idea is gaining traction even at a glacial pace.\n\nBut I don’t want to repeat my old pattern of quitting impulsively.\n\nThe job drains me mentally. I come home exhausted. Hard to build at the pace I want and I'm getting very irritated with everything related to the job which is making me impatient. But now I live in Toronto now, I can’t be reckless, especially as I’m approaching 30. I’m not a dumb 20-year-old anymore. And I don’t want to be the person whose mental health destroys their life again. I see the list of accomplishments I've made but it feels like this dream is nothing but a dream. Nobody around me has ambitious ideas like me. It's all the same, get a job, get a pension, work at a job you tolerate for 40-50 years and retire. \n\nFor those who’ve successfully transitioned out of stable careers to self employment any advice?\n\nHow did you handle the “bridge” phase?  \nHow did you know when it was time to jump?\n\nI know I'm still relatively young and nows the time to take that leap.

It's hard work, you're broke all the time, and you've gotta do a lot of crap that you don't want to do on-top of the things you wanna do.\n\nBut there's a certain type of person that just can't *not* do it. FAFO I guess.\n\nThat being said, I *would* recommend a few key things:\n\nDon't do it until you at minimum have:\n\n1. 6 months of your bills stashed away. I know it's a cliche thing, but seriously - 6 months of bills should be your new zero.\n2. A way to actually make money that has been proven to work. And make sure it's something that's consistent enough. Doesn't have to 100% replace your income (it won't) but it should at least offset most of your expenses.\n3. A \\_very\\_ tight understanding of your finances.\n\nWhich it sounds like from your post you generally have. The biggest pushback I'd put on you is do you have an actual product market fit? Sounds like you have a market, but I'm not hearin' exactly what the product would be. Figure that out, and validate it first.\n\nBooks to read:\n\n* [Profit First](https://mikemichalowicz.com/profit-first/) \\- vital for managing your spending and understanding how to pay yourself.\n* [Launch](https://jeffwalker.com/programs/book-launch/) \\- a bit dated, but I think could be really relevant to you.\n* [E-Myth](https://michaelegerbercompanies.com/product/the-e-myth-revisited/) \\- Even more dated (written in the 80s) but it's just so, so good, and serves as a great gut check to listen to before you make the jump.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. The way you're talking it sounds like you already know you're going to do it, you're just looking for someone to tell you to do it. So, do it, but be ready because no matter how hard you think it is, it's actually harder.\n\nSigned, [the guy who left his cushy job to be an entrepreneur.](https://www.alexstandiford.com/articles/personal-updates/today-was-my-last-day-at-my-day-job/)",

Next, I would slowly ease out of your job, rather than outright quitting all at once.

Making a move is a huge decision for a lot of people, and takes a lot of time to orchestrate.

I’ve been reading *The Mom Test* and some other articles that basically preach the same premise: ask and listen to the customer, let them reach the problem on their own, take it slow, understand their situation deeply, and only then proceed with the sale or solution.\n\nHowever, I’m hitting a bit of a roadblock with this method and I’m hoping you can help me out again:\n\nIf I put myself in a business owner’s shoes, and a total stranger texts me out of the blue asking about my business problems, workflows, or how X thing works... why would I actually spend my time answering a random person about things that take time to explain, without any clear motivation?\n\nHow can I approach this? What’s a good hook to get them to actually want to tell me about their problems without coming across as annoying?",

If a random person texts a business owner asking about their workflows, the default reaction is “Why am I giving you free consulting time?”\n\nThe missing piece is context and value.\n\nYou don’t approach them as “Tell me your problems.” You approach them with relevance and a reason.\n\nFor example, instead of: “Can I ask about your workflow?”\n\nTry: “I’m speaking with a few \\[specific type of business\\] owners about how they handle X. I’m not selling anything right now. I’m trying to understand if a problem I’ve seen is actually common. Would you be open to a 10 minute call?”\n\nNow you’ve done three things:  \n\\- You showed relevance  \n\\- You removed pressure  \n\\- You limited the time ask\n\nAnother angle is to lead with a specific observation: “I noticed you’re doing X. A few companies your size told me they struggle with Y when scaling. Has that been your experience at all?”\n\nThat feels less like an interrogation and more like a thoughtful conversation.\n\nAlso, warm channels beat cold messages every time. Mutual connections, niche communities, industry groups, even commenting on their content first. If they’ve seen your name before, the ask feels less random.\n\nThe real hook is not clever wording. It’s making them feel like:  \n\\- This is relevant to me  \n\\- This will be short  \n\\- This might actually help me\n\nWhen those three are clear, people are much more willing to talk.",

You're looking at relationship coaching through a purely numbers lens before you've even started, and that's gonna mess with your head from day one. I've been down this road of chasing different niches and business models looking for the big payout, and honestly it kept me scattered for years. Here's what I learned the hard way: yeah, people make 100k+ months in relationship coaching. They exist. But they didn't start by asking if it was possible. They started because they genuinely cared about helping people with relationships, got really good at it, and the money followed. If you're already researching other niches before you've even begun, that's a red flag. Not saying you can't make great money in relationships (you absolutely can), but if your main driver is hitting certain revenue numbers, you're gonna burn out or keep niche hopping. I did that for way too long. Pick something you actually care about, something where you'd be happy helping people even if the money took longer to show up. The focus and consistency that comes from genuine interest is what actually builds those big months.",

Distribution is actually much harder than building, and if you aren't talking to potential customers from day one, you’re almost certainly building something nobody actually wants to pay for.\n\n\nReal success doesn't come from a \"big reveal\" on Product Hunt; it comes from one-on-one conversations where you provide value and prove you understand a specific pain point. If you aren't embarrassed by your first version, you probably waited too long to launch and wasted months on features that don't solve the core problem.\n\n\nValue isn't through your eyes, value is through the eyes of the customer. There are many people who come up to me, and most of them have a common question: How do I start? I have only one sane answer: sell something. You don't even need a product to start selling, you could sell emotions, respect and anticipation. \n\n\nLook, through all the scenerios I've seen in business, this is a really big lie.",
