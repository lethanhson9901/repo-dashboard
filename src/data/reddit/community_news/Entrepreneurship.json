      "text": "I import consumer electronics from China and sell to USA retailers. I mostly sell USB chargers and power banks, and do about $12M a year in revenue, with roughly $2.5M tied up in inventory.\n\nOne of my customers’ houses just burned down, and they’re claiming one of my USB chargers caused it, and now they’re demanding indemnification under our contract.\n\nThat’s when I found out something I honestly can’t believe I missed, as I have zero product liability coverage, and it’s excluded from my general liability policy.\n\nMy broker says I need $5M to $10M in product liability insurance, the quote came back at $48K per year. Until now, I was paying $18K total for our existing coverage.\n\nI get why it’s expensive, and that chargers and power banks are literal fire risks. My QC is sample-based, not 100 percent inspection, and while my Chinese suppliers claim they have insurance, I’ve never actually seen proof or been named on a policy.\n\nNow it’s really hitting me how exposed I am. One serious failure could wipe out everything I’ve built, and this isn’t hypothetical anymore, it’s happening.",

Anything that works early is usually something where someone can take a small risk on you and see value quickly.\n\nWhat I’ve seen actually work (and done variations of myself):\n\nFirst, I’d pick one skill that directly ties to revenue. Not “learning broadly,” not consuming courses endlessly. Something where the outcome is obvious to a buyer. Writing that drives leads, ads that drive sales, outbound that books meetings, and simple automation that saves time. The more measurable the outcome, the easier the first yes.\n\nThen I’d attach myself to someone who already has demand. Small business owners, founders, creators. Not by pitching services immediately, but by being useful. Fixing one thing. Pointing out one missed opportunity. Helping for free or cheap at first, just to get proof and confidence.\n\nCold DMs can work, but only when they feel human. The people I’ve seen succeed weren’t blasting templates. They were referencing something specific, asking smart questions, and having real conversations. Low volume, high intent.\n\nContent helps, but not as a growth hack. More as a credibility trail. Writing publicly forces clarity and makes it easier for opportunities to find you over time. It compounds slowly, but it compounds.\n\nWhat I wouldn’t do early:  \nDropshipping without a real edge  \nBrokerage without a network  \nAnything that depends on ads before cash flow  \nAnything that sounds “passive”\n\nThe pattern I’ve noticed is that people who escape zero usually do it by selling effort first, then slowly turning that effort into systems, products, or leverage later.\n\nThe unsexy answer is that it starts with trading time for money. The important part is choosing a trade that teaches you how businesses actually work and puts you close to decision-makers.\n\nCurious what your own conclusion was after the assignment.",

People are always posting to ask if three, six, twelve responses -- nobody paid but a moment's attention to fill out -- is enough 'market traction' to launch.

              "text": "I actually agree with part of what you’re saying: “build it and they will come” thinking kills a lot of products. Customer discovery and real demand matter more than anything else.\n\nWhere I see it differently is that distribution and discovery aren’t opposites. In the early stage, distribution is often just **customer discovery in motion:** talking to people, testing messaging, and seeing who actually cares enough to respond.\n\nMost founders don’t fail because they ignore human nature; they fail because they **misread weak signals as demand** or don’t know what signal to trust.\n\nIf someone can’t get even a small group to consistently care about a problem, no amount of “distribution” will fix that. But when the pain is real, distribution becomes less about pushing and more about **showing up where that pain already exists**.\n\nThat’s mostly what I’m trying to understand better.",

Something that requires hand and eye coordination and dexterity.\n\nIf you're playing catch with a friend and you're talking about something you're passionate about, like some video game or something, you flow. You don't stutter or have pregnant pauses or anxiety, you also won't be dropping the ball and throwing poorly.\n\nThe goal is to be as smooth as a gravy sandwich.\n\nRepetition is the mother of all skill. If you prepare, you will overcome the anxieties because passion and reflex will take over.\n\nI used to gather my sales teams every morning before the bell rang. We had an assortment of dexterity based activities from boxing to ping pong. The room would be a murmur of noise of everyone, pitching. And fielding rebuttals and objections, isolating and overcoming, and then back in line with their pitches.\n\nYou also need to believe in whatever you're doing, where you'll never reach the point of being passionate about. I had my son do cold calling for my business kind of as an uncomfortable lesson. Picking up that phone took him almost an hour for the first time. He was like dad this is hard. Then, we worked on his script.He had it memorized because I told him he had to. He even had some of the objections and rebuttals memorized. But he stuttered and stammered, and his tone changed, and i'm warbled, he pregnant paused, he got tripped up if anything unexpected came his way.\n\nThen we started playing catch. I told him imagine that you've got a truckload of playstation 5s. You're your only job is to get rid of them by the end of the day. And you gotta sell them for twenty five dollars, apiece. Could you do it?\n\nHe was like hell yeah that's crazy! \n\nI'm well, that's the equivalent of what my company sells. We provide truck parts that are made with higher grid materials, improved and patented designs that shorten the installation time from forty five minutes down to 5 minutes. The parts are required consumable and universal. They go on every truck on the planet. The best part is we sell them for about 50+% less than anyone else in the world. \n\nPeople would be stupid not to buy my product. I know that, and I make sure they know that. \n\nOnce, he believed in what we were providing and he understood the price matrix. It became selling playstation 5s for $25.\n\nWe practice the script while throwing the ball and laughing and talking. Within an hour or so, he was smooth. He did regress a bit on the phone because his age. He was 14. He wanted to call everyone, sir.And make sure they're having a good day and none of that was in the script. \n\nIn 9 weeks he had landed 27 Southern Tire Mart locations, 15 new Speedco/Loves locations, and 11 independent repair shops. He made a few thousand dollars in commissions up front, and still sees about $75-$450 a month in residual commissions, 2 years later.",

Most business problems boil down to patterns and optimization once you look past the buzzwords.\n\nFor real world experience without a business family, I'd suggest starting with small freelance projects or helping local businesses with their data or processes. Even something simple like building a basic tracker for a shop's inventory teaches you more than any business book. You learn what actually matters to people who are paying.\n\nCollege wise, I'd honestly look at programs that let you take classes across departments rather than locking into a pure business degree. CS, stats, or even economics paired with a few entrepreneurship courses gives you more flexibility.",

Pick a degree that gives you a strong “earnable skill” Best math-friendly paths: computer science / data science / statistics / economics / engineering. Pure math is fine too, but pair it with coding.\n2. Get real-world experience by doing small projects for real people You don’t need a business family. Offer to help local businesses or school contacts with one specific outcome (a simple website fix, a spreadsheet system, basic data tracking). Do 2–3 of these and you’ll learn more than from theory.\n3. Learn one practical toolset Start with Python + basic SQL, and build 2–3 small projects you can show (GitHub/portfolio).",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m early-stage and trying to figure out the right way to get my first consistent clients, so I’m hoping to learn from people here who’ve been through this. Here’s what I currently offer, very plainly: I help service businesses (local services, clinics, trades, etc.) turn more of their existing demand into actual booked customers. My team handles SEO and paid ads to bring in high-intent enquiries My partner handles automation (instant replies, follow-ups, basic qualification, booking handoff) The core problem we focus on is missed enquiries, slow replies, after-hours gaps, and no follow-up In short: We don’t try to get businesses more leads first we try to stop the leads they already get from slipping through the cracks. Where I’m stuck is client acquisition. I’ve tried: DMs and cold outreach offering audits / reports free automation ideas value-first conversations I’m getting replies, but converting that into paying clients has been inconsistent. So I wanted to ask people here who’ve built agencies or sold to service businesses: If you were starting from zero today, how would you get your first 5–10 clients for an offer like this? Is this the kind of problem owners say they care about, but don’t actually pay for? Would you position this as a standalone service, or bundle it with SEO/ads from day one? What mistakes do you see beginners make when selling to service businesses that I should avoid early? Not trying to promote anything here genuinely trying to avoid wasting time and build this the right way. Any blunt or critical feedback is welcome.",

          "text": "You’re solving a real problem, but early on the issue is usually positioning and proof, not demand.\n\nService owners say they want more leads, but they pay faster for missed money. Reframe the offer around revenue recovery, not systems. For example “we help you book 20–30 percent more of the leads you already pay for” lands better than automation or workflows.\n\nTo get the first 5–10 clients, narrow hard. Pick one vertical where missed calls and slow follow-ups are obvious like dentists, home services, clinics. Talk only to them. Generic service business messaging slows trust.\n\nSell this as a short pilot, not a full service. A 14 or 30 day conversion fix with a clear before and after is easier to say yes to than an ongoing retainer. Once results show, upsell SEO or ads.\n\nEarly mistakes I see all the time are over-educating, bundling too much too soon, and leading with tools instead of outcomes. Owners do not care about automations. They care about booked jobs and fewer leaks.\n\nIf you can clearly show “you missed X leads last month, here’s how much that cost you, we fix that first,” you will close faster.",
