      "text": "Hello, I'm new to this, so forgive me if I'm not very specific or if I ramble a little, a friend just recommended do this to me 😂. \nI am 30 years old, from Havana, Cuba. I am from the new private sector on the island. My business is bringing merchandise from abroad (containers) and sell it here. I bring them through a partner from Panama. \nWe have already brought in some containers of cement and they have sold well. \nI have a friend who brings 40 containers of rice a month and he does excellent. So I want to expand and bring food, you must understand that this is a necessity on the island because the internal production of food is very bad, there is excessive regulation in agriculture, so importing food is essential now. \nI have good contacts in the private sector and am putting together what I believe is a good distribution network. \nWhat I'm looking for is advice, mentors, investors, friends, whatever 😂. In order to expand my financial capacity, vision, collaboration, etc. \nI would also like someone who could give me advice on products that can be entered into the current Cuban market (keep in mind that it is a subsistence market). I want to buy new warehouses, prices here are quite cheap today. \nThe more support the better, I have many friends in Cuba but few friends outside. \nI am quite ambitious and I sincerely believe that I can dominate part of the market with some time and my goal is also to position myself for the next Cuba that will come, which God wants to be soon. \nI consider that I have a good business model with good ROI and many growth opportunities. Something that was difficult in this country. Everything with sanity and little by little because I don't like to rush. Any comments are obviously welcome and greetings to the community, this is exciting 😂. ",

My last run was as Head of Content where I built a \"content-to-commerce\" ecosystem that scaled annual revenue from $2M to $8M in 18 months. We basically turned organic video into a high-ticket funnel that actually converted.  \n\nI’m talking high-end cinematic stuff, feature-length documentary standards. I’ve managed the P&L, built global teams from scratch, and handled everything from AI-integrated workflows to GEO/AEO strategy to keep us visible in the new search landscape.  \n\nThe problem:\n\nI’m back in the job market and it’s a graveyard. I’m seeing 500+ applicants on LinkedIn within 10 minutes. I have the data, the portfolio, and the ROI to prove I can move the needle, but I’m getting ghosted by automated HR filters. It feels like the \"apply\" button is just a black hole.\n\nIf you’re a founder or an agency owner here:\n\n1. Is the market actually this saturated, or are companies just overwhelmed by low-quality AI applications that they’ve stopped looking at the real talent?\n\n2. Where do you actually find your senior creative leadership? Because the traditional boards feel like a waste of time for anyone above mid-level.\n\nI’m not looking for a pity party, I’m looking for the \"new rules\" of the game. If you’ve managed to bypass the gatekeepers or you're a founder who hires for these roles, where should I be looking?",

Comment on their posts with specific ideas, send 30–60s loom breakdowns of their current funnel, and ask sharp questions that only someone who’s done this at scale would know to ask. That gets you into real conversations fast.\n\n\n\nOn the tooling side, I’ve used Apollo and Clay to build those target lists, and then Pulse for Reddit to surface founders talking about broken content or demand gen so I can join the thread with something useful instead of cold pitching.

The volume of applications is insane, and companies are leaning heavily on filters just to survive the noise. Unfortunately that means nuance and real track records get lost.   \nFor roles at your level, I have seen more traction come from warm intros and direct conversations than job boards. Founders and hiring managers often hire through their network long before a role is fully public. Reaching out directly with a short, tailored message about how you would move revenue or fix a specific gap can sometimes cut through faster than a polished application.   \nThe market is crowded, but it’s also overwhelmed.

Next, I would slowly ease out of your job, rather than outright quitting all at once.

Making a move is a huge decision for a lot of people, and takes a lot of time to orchestrate. You as an agent are there to make that orchestration and the job of actually moving a lot less stressful and to make it a convenience for them.",

You usually know your strengths, your risk tolerance, and the kind of lifestyle you want. The real question isn’t age. It’s finding a business model that fits your goals and energy.\n\nIf you started or are thinking of starting a business after 40, what pushed you to consider it?",

I had no experience, not to mention a uni degree in marketing or anything like that, so I just started doing free work.\n\nLost some clients, slept badly, constantly stressed and ashamed.\n\nI kept telling myself if I got better then I’d succeed. So I constantly tried to make better ads, better landing pages, more attractive lead magnets, etc.\n\nSomewhere in all that mess I developed pretty strong technical skills. Not for the flashy creative stuff. But the systems, the funnels, the data tracking. The boring parts.\nNow that’s all I focus on.\n\nFor example, I built a funnel for a CA construction company that sells these mini Chinese backyard houses (ADUs) that homeowners can rent out. They’re around $250k per unit and they are selling 5 per month thanks to me. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything, just wanted to share my story as an inspiration.\n",

And fake engagement can hurt reach long term.\n\nIf you want help, hire for content strategy or content creation, not “growth.” For example:\n• Someone to help you define a niche and angle\n• Someone to write better hooks and posts\n• Someone to design simple visuals\n• Someone to analyze what’s working in your space\n\nAffiliate marketing works when you build trust and consistent value. Growth hacks without positioning usually waste money.\n\nBefore hiring anyone, ask yourself:\nDo I know exactly who I’m targeting and what problem I solve?\n\nIf that’s unclear, no freelancer can fix it.",

If a random person texts a business owner asking about their workflows, the default reaction is “Why am I giving you free consulting time?”\n\nThe missing piece is context and value.\n\nYou don’t approach them as “Tell me your problems.” You approach them with relevance and a reason.\n\nFor example, instead of: “Can I ask about your workflow?”\n\nTry: “I’m speaking with a few \\[specific type of business\\] owners about how they handle X. I’m not selling anything right now. I’m trying to understand if a problem I’ve seen is actually common. Would you be open to a 10 minute call?”\n\nNow you’ve done three things:  \n\\- You showed relevance  \n\\- You removed pressure  \n\\- You limited the time ask\n\nAnother angle is to lead with a specific observation: “I noticed you’re doing X. A few companies your size told me they struggle with Y when scaling. Has that been your experience at all?”\n\nThat feels less like an interrogation and more like a thoughtful conversation.\n\nAlso, warm channels beat cold messages every time. Mutual connections, niche communities, industry groups, even commenting on their content first. If they’ve seen your name before, the ask feels less random.\n\nThe real hook is not clever wording. It’s making them feel like:  \n\\- This is relevant to me  \n\\- This will be short  \n\\- This might actually help me\n\nWhen those three are clear, people are much more willing to talk.",

      "text": "**Trigger warning:** mental health.\n\n27M. Immigrant household. Small town. Raised on “pick something safe and survive.”\n\nI did. Went to school, landed a great first job. On paper it was perfect. But during that time, a slow depression crept in, personal life, identity stuff, family pressure, and I started questioning everything. Including the career, I spent 4 years studying.\n\nI’ve always been more creative and entrepreneurial. Started a small handcrafted fragrance brand that got into the biggest mall in Ontario. Did all the branding and marketing myself. It wasn’t anything crazy but an accomplishment nonetheless. I hit a breaking point where my mental health got so bad I basically burned my life down to the ground and impulsively quit my job, and decided to try pursuing this business idea.\n\nMom found out because I was suddenly… happy. Panic ensued. I was bombarded about resume gaps and ruined futures. I folded. Applied to teacher’s college and ended up having daily panic attacks. It was a full-body “no.” I fell into an even darker place mentally.\n\nSo to get out of that I ended up back in my original field in a government role. And everytime someone asks what I do the response is always “you're set for life” and it makes me nauseous.\n\nI can literally see 40 years ahead and I don’t like what I see AT ALL. \n\nOver the last year I rebuilt my savings, moved out to downtown Toronto to reset my environment, and found Pilates. Something I didn’t expect would be my next venture, but I’ve never felt more aligned. It feels like a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIn the year and a half I’ve been in this corporate job:\n\n* Got certified in Pilates\n* Made Pilates the top fitness program at my YMCA in 3 months of being certified\n* Rebuilt my savings after burning my life to the ground a year prior\n* Signed a lease and finally moved out of my parents house into my own condo in Toronto.\n* Got hired at a major Pilates studio in Toronto\n* Launched an online Pilates community\n* Had a TikTok bring in 200+ leads, 50 conversions - proof of concept\n\nIt feels aligned. I can see the vision clearly and oddly so do others (my parents included - but to them just as a side income thing)  And the idea is gaining traction even at a glacial pace.\n\nBut I don’t want to repeat my old pattern of quitting impulsively.\n\nThe job drains me mentally. I come home exhausted. Hard to build at the pace I want and I'm getting very irritated with everything related to the job which is making me impatient. But now I live in Toronto now, I can’t be reckless, especially as I’m approaching 30. I’m not a dumb 20-year-old anymore. And I don’t want to be the person whose mental health destroys their life again. I see the list of accomplishments I've made but it feels like this dream is nothing but a dream. Nobody around me has ambitious ideas like me. It's all the same, get a job, get a pension, work at a job you tolerate for 40-50 years and retire. \n\nFor those who’ve successfully transitioned out of stable careers to self employment any advice?\n\nHow did you handle the “bridge” phase?  \nHow did you know when it was time to jump?\n\nI know I'm still relatively young and nows the time to take that leap. I know that is what the 80 year old version of me is saying to myself but it's terrifying. I want to, but I also don't want to be stupid about it.",

FAFO I guess.\n\nThat being said, I *would* recommend a few key things:\n\nDon't do it until you at minimum have:\n\n1. 6 months of your bills stashed away. I know it's a cliche thing, but seriously - 6 months of bills should be your new zero.\n2. A way to actually make money that has been proven to work. And make sure it's something that's consistent enough. Doesn't have to 100% replace your income (it won't) but it should at least offset most of your expenses.\n3. A \\_very\\_ tight understanding of your finances.\n\nWhich it sounds like from your post you generally have. The biggest pushback I'd put on you is do you have an actual product market fit? Sounds like you have a market, but I'm not hearin' exactly what the product would be. Figure that out, and validate it first.\n\nBooks to read:\n\n* [Profit First](https://mikemichalowicz.com/profit-first/) \\- vital for managing your spending and understanding how to pay yourself.\n* [Launch](https://jeffwalker.com/programs/book-launch/) \\- a bit dated, but I think could be really relevant to you.\n* [E-Myth](https://michaelegerbercompanies.com/product/the-e-myth-revisited/) \\- Even more dated (written in the 80s) but it's just so, so good, and serves as a great gut check to listen to before you make the jump.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. The way you're talking it sounds like you already know you're going to do it, you're just looking for someone to tell you to do it. So, do it, but be ready because no matter how hard you think it is, it's actually harder.\n\nSigned, [the guy who left his cushy job to be an entrepreneur.](https://www.alexstandiford.com/articles/personal-updates/today-was-my-last-day-at-my-day-job/)",

That's not nothing, that's proof you can execute when something clicks. I'm a coach now but I used to chase quick wins constantly. Dropshipping, NFTs, you name it. Made good money but it was never sustainable. The difference between those and what you're describing with Pilates? You can actually see yourself doing this long term. That gut feeling matters. Here's what I'd do. Don't quit yet, but start treating your gov job like it's funding your real business. Set a financial target (maybe six months of expenses plus a cushion) and a traction milestone (like consistent monthly revenue or X number of clients). Work backwards from there. The bridge phase sucks, I won't lie. You'll be tired and impatient. But you're not being impulsive this time, you're being strategic. And honestly, the fact that you're even asking these questions means you're not that person who burned it down anymore. You're building this time, not running. Keep going.",

You're looking at relationship coaching through a purely numbers lens before you've even started, and that's gonna mess with your head from day one. I've been down this road of chasing different niches and business models looking for the big payout, and honestly it kept me scattered for years. Here's what I learned the hard way: yeah, people make 100k+ months in relationship coaching. They exist. But they didn't start by asking if it was possible. They started because they genuinely cared about helping people with relationships, got really good at it, and the money followed. If you're already researching other niches before you've even begun, that's a red flag. Not saying you can't make great money in relationships (you absolutely can), but if your main driver is hitting certain revenue numbers, you're gonna burn out or keep niche hopping. I did that for way too long. Pick something you actually care about, something where you'd be happy helping people even if the money took longer to show up. The focus and consistency that comes from genuine interest is what actually builds those big months.",

The next version, shaped by those conversations, got traction. The product needed to exist, but distribution needed to be part of the plan from day one.

          "text": "What I've learnt the hard way:\n\n\nThe harsh reality is that technical founders especially tend to think an amazing product will find its own audience, but that leads to launching into total silence. Distribution is actually much harder than building, and if you aren't talking to potential customers from day one, you’re almost certainly building something nobody actually wants to pay for.\n\n\nReal success doesn't come from a \"big reveal\" on Product Hunt; it comes from one-on-one conversations where you provide value and prove you understand a specific pain point. If you aren't embarrassed by your first version, you probably waited too long to launch and wasted months on features that don't solve the core problem.\n\n\nValue isn't through your eyes, value is through the eyes of the customer. There are many people who come up to me, and most of them have a common question: How do I start? I have only one sane answer: sell something. You don't even need a product to start selling, you could sell emotions, respect and anticipation. \n\n\nLook, through all the scenerios I've seen in business, this is a really big lie.",

That's where the gold was. One user mentioned trying to 'time their posts for a UK audience.' That single comment led to the Best Posting Time Analyzer, a feature that differentiates the tool at https://reoogle.com. Users often can't articulate the solution, but they can vividly describe their struggle. Your job is to listen to the struggle, not the suggested fix. How do you extract actionable insights from vague user feedback?",
