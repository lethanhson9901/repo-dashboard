Which skill has the most demand now? There's a lot of competition everywhere and 1000s of people unemployed in every niche.\n\nWhat skill would you suggest me in this era?",

But I’ve also made a lot, and it’s changed my life for the better and opened doors. \n\nAlmost everybody has that restaurant itch; but be careful - not everyone should scratch it, and some need to be okay with never caving in (or maybe they can invest in a restaurant with discretionary funds, if you absolutely must but aren’t ready for the torture). \n\nMore important than the concept, make sure the franchisor is good people, have strong leadership, and you feel in your soul they want to take care of franchisees and want them to win. I can’t overstate this.",

For the right person, that pace is addictive in a good way. But you’re absolutely right. Not everyone should scratch the restaurant itch. It can look glamorous from the outside, but it’s intense.\n\nAnd your point about the franchisor is huge. The brand matters, but the leadership and how they treat franchisees matters even more. If the people at the top aren’t aligned with your success, it makes the journey a lot harder.\n\nThanks for sharing your story. This is the kind of perspective people thinking about leaving corporate really need to hear.",

That’s powerful. You’re absolutely right: you’re selling reliability and trust, not trends.\n\nFood can look exciting, but the labor, waste, and thin margins can wear people down fast. Service businesses, on the other hand, tend to have stronger margins and more predictable demand if you build a solid team.

Meaning, look for a problem in that area and find a way to solve it (and charge for that).\n\nSounds simple right? Yet I have three or four concepts (most with websites) that are going nowhere because I'm awful at taking my own advice. One is paranormal, one is a delivery company, and one is political. Lately I've been thinking about universal health care.\n\nI'm stuck at the \"monetizing it\" part. You need to find out what you're passionate about, and provide a solution to their problem. Then you can \"run the numbers\" as I like to say. You figure out what it costs to provide the solution (including every cost plus contingency), and then add your profit margin. That's your price. Now see if the market will bear it. Look at competitors or similar products. Who's your market? Do they / can they / will they spend on this?\n\nAs for scalability, if it's a viable concept it should apply to enough people to reach some kind of *critical mass* of operations.\n\nJust my two cents. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBTW, if you're 21, learn as much as you can about everything you can get your eyeballs on. So often later in life we \"discover our true passion.\" Some of that is maturity and previous life experiences. Some just bumbled into something they were really passionate about. \n\nSo much inspiration happens as you learn stuff.\n\nLearn as much stuff as you can.

The goal is consistent presence.\n\nThe results? Traffic from Reddit is smaller but steady and predictable. The users who come are higher quality and more likely to stick around. I've also built real relationships with a few other founders in those spaces.\n\nIt's a boring strategy, but it's building a foundation that a one-time viral hit never could.

I get that collapsed feeling.\n\nHere's what I wish someone told me back then: you're not starting from zero.

I spent years chasing quick wins (dropshipping that got banned, crypto schemes, all that) because I thought I'd be rich by now. Spoiler alert, I wasn't. But all that failure taught me I needed something sustainable, something with actual purpose.\n\nRight now you're probably feeling scattered and maybe looking at too many options at once. Been there. My Notion is still packed with half started ideas. What helped me was asking: what made me feel purpose before? For me it was coaching soccer for kids. That's why I'm building my coaching business now.\n\nWhat's one thing you've done in the past that actually made you feel alive? Start there.

You're selling management consulting, with a proprietary tech product in your portfolio.\n\nHow many org designers do you have on staff? What process design experience do you have? Do you bring compliance expertise? What's your theory of customer experience design? Are you familiar with SCOR, spans of control, brand health metrics, evidence building & program evaluation, cost modeling?\n\nWith respect, there is no way that you, a developer, is able to offer that knowledge at 22 without backing from *decades* of others' experience. My typical team has, in aggregate, between 25 and 100 years of  subject matter experience in the relevant domains.\n\n>The moment you try to automate something, you’re forced to define triggers, outcomes, ownership and what happens if nothing happens. Most businesses avoid those questions.\n\nOr, you are not selling the outcomes they're buying. A good process that doesn't produce the outcomes you want is worth nothing next to a bad one that does. Nobody's problem is that they need automation. Every business's problem is that they need a cheaper and quicker way to deliver the outcomes their client wants. If your way is quicker and cheaper, but doesn't deliver the outcomes for their clients, then it actually isn't quicker or cheaper for them. \n\n>Automation doesn’t let you, it doesn’t scale chaos. It exposes it. [...] Humans focus on judgment and strategy, repetition belongs to systems and automation isn’t the final step after perfection. For many companies, it’s what forces structure in the first place.\n\nAgain, respectfully but this is a *terrible* value prop for your customers. You don't design the process to the tech. You design the tech to the (future state) process. And there are better, more reliable ways of exposing flaws in those processes than by melting them down with a piece of tech that won't work with what they're doing.\n\nI have deployed B2B connections at a Fortune 100 company, on behalf of the *only* vendor out of a dozen that was allowed to automate. We didn't use a ritzy product, we used python and a CSV file. You know why? Because we could demonstrate that our method would respect the integrity of their compliance-heavy process (including giving them the ability to manually intervene), and nobody else's proposed solution did. \n\nTech is never the answer, it is an enabler for the answer -- but you *have* to know the answer first.",

Even something simple like building a basic tracker for a shop's inventory teaches you more than any business book. You learn what actually matters to people who are paying.\n\nCollege wise, I'd honestly look at programs that let you take classes across departments rather than locking into a pure business degree.

      "text": "If you’re thinking about taking the leap into franchising, here’s some hard-earned perspective from someone who’s worked with dozens of first-time owners.\n\nThe biggest thing I see people underestimate isn’t the upfront cost. It’s the day-to-day reality. Owning a franchise isn’t passive income. Even “semi-absentee” models require 10–15 hours a week just to manage payroll, vendors, and staff. That structure the franchise provides is helpful, but it doesn’t replace leadership.\n\nAnother surprise? Staffing. Hiring reliable people is harder than most expect. One bad hire can create headaches that ripple through your business and burn you out if you’re not careful.\n\nCash flow also comes as a shock. Even profitable units need reserves to cover unexpected costs, slow months, or marketing experiments. Thinking you’ll “break even quickly” is usually too optimistic.\n\nOn the bright side, the support from the franchise, training, systems, branding, is invaluable, especially if you’re coming from corporate. It’s like a blueprint, but you still need to execute it well.\n\nIf I could give one piece of advice to a first-time franchisee: go slow, plan meticulously, and test your workflow before scaling. Enjoy the process, celebrate small wins, and treat the business like a system, not a side hustle.\n\nFranchising can be incredibly rewarding if you go in with your eyes open.",

I think a lot of people come into it assuming that because of the brand name, everything will be automated, but in reality it is still very much a people-and-process business.\n\nThe staffing point really resonated with me. Most new owners focus on location, funding, or marketing, but the biggest challenge is often staffing and managing workflow. From what I have seen working with small business teams, owners who treat hiring as a system tend to experience less burnout than those who react to problems as they arise.\n\nI also completely agree about cash flow surprises. Even profitable setups can feel stressful when processes are not streamlined. Many newer franchisees have started automating smaller administrative tasks such as lead tracking, customer follow-ups, and reporting dashboards to protect their time. Once repetitive tasks are reduced, it becomes easier to think like an owner instead of an operator.\n\nThe biggest shift seems to be the “business as a system” mindset you mentioned. Scaling becomes smoother when people focus less on working harder and more on designing workflows that run consistently, whether through vetted freelancers, automation tools, or structured support models.",

It's not posting. It's lurking with intent.\n\nDoing this manually for Reddit took me countless hours. I'd find a great subreddit, only to realize it banned self-promotion entirely, or that it was actually inactive.\n\nThis reconnaissance phase is a massive time sink that isn't taught. I built Reoogle to automate the mapping part, but the lesson is universal: invest time in understanding the landscape before you try to sell in it.

      "text": "here's a funny story that happened to me last year and gave me an insight in how larger influencers see direct partnerships with brands.\n\nin 2025 I tested a new product that I developed in the pet space. it was a different type of dog treat dispenser and I wanted to see if it could rank for higher volume keywords even if it was different from most treat dispensers on amazon.\n\nto launch my product I contacted hundreds of small influencers (5k-50k followers on Instagram) offering to send them my product to get their feedback. the idea was that they would want to post about it if they liked it... and it worked! dozens of them posted on launch day.\n\nthis story is about one of them.\n\nI found Mina's dog with 6k followers on Instagram. She gave me her address to send her the product to try. After a week I followed up asking if she tried it. She replied:\n\n**\"OMG MY PIG LOVES IT!\"**\n\n...wait, what?!\n\nit turns out that Mina has a dog with 6k followers but she has also **a pet pig called Merlin with 800k followers on Instagram and over 1.5M followers on TikTok** (he's really cute). Apparently Merlin really liked my treat dispenser and she wanted to post about it!\n\nI was stoked!\n\nI was offering everyone 30% affiliate fees. I wasn't using any tool at the time and I created Amazon Attribution links manually for each one of them. They all got their links and shared them in their content.\n\n**but Mina didn't want my 30% commission!** she preferred to post using Merlin's Amazon Associates link which only gives her \\~4%!\n\nall the micro influencers generated only a few sales so they were ok with me sending screenshots of the Amazon Attribution dashboard and payments via Venmo / PayPal.\n\nMina knows that Amazon will pay Merlin the 4% commissions on his sales, but she doesn't know my brand. she was really nice and supportive of my product, but given the volume of sales she can generate, she prefers certainity of payment from Amazon, over a less certain commission that is 7x bigger! She also wants to see how many sales she generated for that specific profuct, and my Amazon Attribution screenshots are not ideal for that.\n\nAfter this experience I built a tool called Coral to manage Amazon affiliates. Now influencers see the same data I see, directly from my Amazon Attribution and payouts are automatic. So they know they will get paid and exactly how much.\n\nSo to recap here's the insight:  \n**big influencers value certainty of getting paid over commission value.**\n\nI thought that offering 30% instead of 4% will make it a no-brainer for them to work with me, but that was the case only for small creators who do this as a hobby.\n\nThey still convert in sales, but Merlin the Pig generated many more sales! I can't tell how many because it's hidden on their Amazon Associates dashboard, but to this day I get reviews from people talking about how their pet pig loves the treat dispenser (lol).",

I asked only for their feedback, the discussion about posting arrived later after they got back to me saying that their dogs (or pigs) liked my product",

      "text": "I’ve seen a lot of people ask if a franchise can work as a side hustle, and the answer really depends on the type of business and your goals.\n\nSome franchises are more hands-on and require full-time attention, while others have systems and support in place that make part-time ownership possible. The key is finding something that fits your schedule, budget, and lifestyle.\n\nIt can be worth it if you’re looking for a structured business with a proven model, but it’s not “set it and forget it.” You’ll still need to stay involved, even if part-time.\n\nFor those who’ve tried, did running a franchise on the side feel doable or more overwhelming than expected?",
