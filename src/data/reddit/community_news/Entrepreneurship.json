Learn whatever you want to learn (maybe what you are passionate about)\n\n6.

But what i am saying is you should consider asking some deeper questions about life.   \n  \nStatistically i am sorry to say but serious $$ don't always go to the hard working or the smart.  Luck and chance happen to us all. There is a quote that basically says this \"if working hard made you rich donkeys would be covered in gold\" \n\nI have also known people who make great money but are always broke (lifestyle creep and poor life partner choices can burn you real good)\n\nyou can make serious money as a Doctor, Lawyer, Software Engineer, Investor, running a septic tank service business etc.. Your asking someone to predict the future \"If i do A i will get B\" Sorry life don't work that way.\n\nJust keep making the wisest most logical choice you can given you gifts, talents, interests, and resources and I hope the best for your future.",

I’ve worked as a business analyst for 15+ years, and what you’re describing is something I see all the time when a service business grows faster than the internal structure can support.\n\nWhen growth hits you from multiple directions (bigger accounts, hiring needs, operations breaking), it feels like you’re drowning, but usually it comes down to one thing:\n\nYour business outgrew the systems it was built on.\n\nA few things that might help you get your head above water:\n\nIdentify the bottleneck. Your biggest constraint right now is likely operational load, not demand.\n\nAsk yourself: “If I had to 2× tomorrow, what breaks first?” That’s the true problem.\n\nSeparate the business into two lanes:\n• Fulfillment (the service you deliver)\n• Infrastructure (the systems that support it)\nMost founders try to fix both at once and burn out.\n\nPrioritize one structural change, not ten.\nYou mentioned hiring + expanding + fixing operations.\nIt’s tempting to chase all of that.\nPick ONE change that gives you the most breathing room.\n\nIf you want, I’m running a small prototype where I help entrepreneurs map their business clearly and spot the bottlenecks holding them back. Happy to take a look and give you some direction at no cost, no pitch, just clarity.\n\nEither way, you’re not crazy, this stage hits every business that grows fast.

BUT everyone has different timing..Maybe you’re not fully ready to quit..And while you can discipline yourself, you can’t force it :) We’re all part of nature..\n\nI did personal budgeting & then cut down my spending a lot ! Good thing is that your biz is making money…See whether you can sustain your life w/ your biz income..See if you can work part-time rather than full time….But if you quit full time job that may limit your borrowing power (biz or personal loan)..\n\nSo I say do your ground work & when you’re ready, you’ll jump :) It’s okay..This is hard & a lot of us are hard on ourselves :) Think about it, a lot of ppl are actually afraid to even start..And you’re way ahead of them! But try to do budgeting & cut down your expenses..Also see how much financing you’ll need and how you can secure them w/o a job or get it while you have one…All these prep will be helpful and will help you tackle fear…Good luck! :)))",

At that point, the hesitation usually comes from framing the move as a permanent, irreversible leap instead of a series of controlled tests.\n\nOne thing that helped me (and others I’ve seen) is lowering the identity stakes, not the effort. Instead of quitting to go all in, define a clear experiment: a revenue milestone, a time-bound runway, or a transition plan where the job becomes optional rather than abruptly gone.\n\nYou don’t need to jump off a cliff to honor what your gut is telling you. You can build a bridge. The goal isn’t bravery for its own sake, it’s making a move that still lets you sleep at night and show up for your kids.\n\nSometimes the most entrepreneurial thing you can do is design the exit carefully instead of dramatically.",

Through it all I bootstrapped my tech companies, I closed million dollar deals, I worked with big brands such as PWC, Teleperformance, L’Óreal, LVMH, Toyota, Fiat, Red Bull, Sony, Epic Games etc… I’ve been the only Developer, Designer and Marketeer and led teams of people and whole departments as CTO. I’ve given talks at Websummit, VivaTech, IGS, AWE and taught classes or gave workshops on colleges and universities.\n\nBut right now I’m facing some really tough times.\n\nInvestment (which I finally turned too) is taking too long to materialize and each day that goes through, the hole I’m in gets deeper and with 3 kids that’s not something you want.\n\nSo that’s why I’m turning to you all for help.\n\nAll I want is a shot to work my way out of this hole and I’ve got a lot of wisdom and experience building and marketing all kinds of technology as well as living and bootstrapping as an Entrepreneur and I’m available to share it all with you.\n\nSo if you want to know how to build things well or fast or performative, how to make tech stacks cheaper (I’m really good at finding cheaper alternatives), how to market something, how to price it, how to make a good pitchdeck (i worked with a lot of startups in the past for this), how to make a good presentation, how to speak at an event, or just have a conversation and vent about the VC ecosystem or what not to do as startup, PLEASE LET’S TALK and make that time worth for both of us.\n\nAs I said, all I want is a shot to work my way out of this and I have faith in the brotherhood/sisterhood that is the Startup Community and that you will help me.\n\nThank you for your time and may all your businesses prosper!",

Founders make obvious bad decisions and fight themselves every step of the way. Just to finally figure out supply does not force demand to manifest automagically. Dull instincts for survival need to be honed. \n\nIt's not the struggle, it's the completely avoidable boring problems wantrepreneurs wallow in that sucks.

Would strongly suggest that you get to know your local businesses - they all belong to similar organizations/clubs  and know each other - we began to receive regular referrals.  \n3. Niched down into a specific industry. Marketing, messaging, and referrals became much easier.  \n4. Stopped selling websites. Most business owners do not care about websites. They care about solutions and results so instead, my agency sold 'Marketing Solutions' (Packaged several services together to get them to the end result).\n\nOnce you get your process, offers and experience locked-in it will become easier to scale with partners, affiliates, and other complimentary businesses.\n\n  \nHope this helps!",

Google is destroying new businness by calling us scam and basing on... nothing!!!\n\nAnyone faced that and knows how to fix it?",

      "text": "Hey everyone - I’m doing some early-stage market research on a new offline advertising concept and I’d love honest, critical feedback from people who work in marketing, brand, growth, or media buying.\n\n**The idea:**\n\nInstead of just billboards, posters, or bus ads, brands can sponsor **to-go coffee cups**.  \nA company buys blocks of branded cups, and those cups get distributed for free to consumers in the area selected by the brand.\n\nSo if a brand wants to target commuters in Manchester, London, Leeds, etc., their branding and message/CTA appears on thousands of takeaway cups in those areas.\n\nThe thinking is that this channel is:  \n• Offline and real-world (like billboards, OOH, transit ads)  \n• Hyper-targeted by location  \n• High frequency (people carry the cup around)  \n• High goodwill (people associate it with something positive – coffee)\n\n**I’m** ***not*** **selling anything here** – just genuinely trying to understand if this is:  \nA) A serious marketing channel  \nB) A gimmick  \nC) Something brands would only test at a small scale\n\nMy questions:\n\n👉 If you work with brands or in marketing:  \n• Would this be something you’d consider testing?  \n• What would make it feel legit vs gimmicky?  \n• How would you measure success?  \n• What kind of brand or campaign do you think this fits best?\n\n👉 If you’ve bought offline ads before:  \n• Would this sit alongside billboards / transit / posters – or not really?  \n• What budget range would make sense for something like this to try?\n\nI’m especially interested in hearing from:  \n• Media buyers  \n• Brand managers  \n• Growth marketers  \n• Anyone who’s run OOH / offline campaigns\n\nBrutal honesty is welcome. If it’s bad, tell me why. If it’s interesting, tell me what would need to be true for it to actually work.\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

              "text": "Well that's the ultimate question for sure. Not sure if that's a literal question or if you are questioning if it's financially viable. In the literal sense - the business model, in theory (not proven or validated yet), is that businesses would pay for x amount of coffee cups to be printed and distributed with their brand and QR code/CTA on the coffee cup - the price of which would be higher than what it costs to print and distribute the cups - which results in profit (apologise if you didn't mean your question in the literal sense). \n\nIf you are questioning if it's financially viable, I have no idea - that's what I'm trying to figure out. This is very very early idea stage, so I'm speaking with as many people as I can to see if I can invalidate the idea before anything else. But it's reaching the point where we'll have to do a real-world test and see how it stacks up. Maybe this medium has a huge conversation and offers huge ROI opportunity for companies - I have no idea, it probably won't, but I don't have any data or insights to validate or invalidate that. \n\nBut I do absolutely take your point around being an inferior medium, and I agree, I think it is, but I guess it depends on the business/industry and a whole bunch of other factors. Nonetheless, I really appreciate your feedback and giving your opinion - it's helping me massively in terms of shaping (or binning) the idea - thank you!",

But people into brand development are into vanity metrics and this could work for that infamous phrase \"Who cares about sales ...it's building *the brand*.\"\n\nAny pitch you can crowbar 'brand awareness' into might work. Brand developers are a delusional bunch.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't new ... nobody has any reason to even bother to consult with you. They'll partner, then send whatever materials to the supplier of that partner. In other words you are an intermediary on the ultimate disintermediation platform, a middleman without a meaningful purpose.\n\nFor anybody unaware, large brands already have marketing employees whose only job is to justify their existence at the corporation's expense. It's called overhead. And you shouldn't aspire to be an overhead cost.",

And whatever antics you used to get the twenty thousand might be wrong for getting an audience full of customers. It's always possible you may lose the audience you have in trying to gain an audience that actually wants what you sell.\n\nWhile you're asking, have the marketer you hire explain there is no such thing as a product supply niche.
