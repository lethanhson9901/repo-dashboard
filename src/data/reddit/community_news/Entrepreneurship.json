      "text": "I’m going to be blunt because I’m genuinely confused.\n\nI’ve spent 11 years as a Creative & Video Director. My last run was as Head of Content where I built a \"content-to-commerce\" ecosystem that scaled annual revenue from $2M to $8M in 18 months. We basically turned organic video into a high-ticket funnel that actually converted.  \n\nI’m talking high-end cinematic stuff, feature-length documentary standards. I’ve managed the P&L, built global teams from scratch, and handled everything from AI-integrated workflows to GEO/AEO strategy to keep us visible in the new search landscape.  \n\nThe problem:\n\nI’m back in the job market and it’s a graveyard. I’m seeing 500+ applicants on LinkedIn within 10 minutes. I have the data, the portfolio, and the ROI to prove I can move the needle, but I’m getting ghosted by automated HR filters. It feels like the \"apply\" button is just a black hole.\n\nIf you’re a founder or an agency owner here:\n\n1. Is the market actually this saturated, or are companies just overwhelmed by low-quality AI applications that they’ve stopped looking at the real talent?\n\n2. Where do you actually find your senior creative leadership? Because the traditional boards feel like a waste of time for anyone above mid-level.\n\nI’m not looking for a pity party, I’m looking for the \"new rules\" of the game. If you’ve managed to bypass the gatekeepers or you're a founder who hires for these roles, where should I be looking?",

Your portfolio and numbers are crazy strong, but they only matter if specific people actually feel the pain you solve and see you talking directly to them. \n\n\n\nWhat’s worked for me in a similar spot: make a hit list of 30–50 founders/CMOs where your “content-to-commerce” case study is directly relevant, then spend 2–3 weeks just showing up in their world. Comment on their posts with specific ideas, send 30–60s loom breakdowns of their current funnel, and ask sharp questions that only someone who’s done this at scale would know to ask. That gets you into real conversations fast.\n\n\n\nOn the tooling side, I’ve used Apollo and Clay to build those target lists, and then Pulse for Reddit to surface founders talking about broken content or demand gen so I can join the thread with something useful instead of cold pitching. The point is to become the person they already trust before the role even exists.",

The volume of applications is insane, and companies are leaning heavily on filters just to survive the noise. Unfortunately that means nuance and real track records get lost.   \nFor roles at your level, I have seen more traction come from warm intros and direct conversations than job boards. Founders and hiring managers often hire through their network long before a role is fully public. Reaching out directly with a short, tailored message about how you would move revenue or fix a specific gap can sometimes cut through faster than a polished application.   \nThe market is crowded, but it’s also overwhelmed. The game seems less about credentials and more about getting in front of the right human. ",

She told me directly she wouldn't have ever seen my application without that message. \n\nJust an example, nowadays you may need to go above and beyond and message people at the company asking for advice on how to break through.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI read Think and Grow Rich not too long ago and became really intrigued by the idea of a mastermind group, so I decided to start one. Over the past six months, I led a small group of friends from home and university. It went well overall, but eventually things fizzled out as these things sometimes do.\n\nNow I’m looking to start another group with renewed focus. The goal would be to share goals and milestones, exchange knowledge, talk through challenges we’re facing, and give honest feedback and advice to help each other move forward. Looking to make a group chat and meet for a zoom maybe every other week.\n\nIf this sounds like something you’d be interested in, I’d love to connect.",

First, take it from someone who thought he had it figured out at your age - things will change. I would actually say it's better to admit you don't know what you want to do than thinking you're sure of what you want to do. You're going to be open to a lot more opportunities than your peers since you won't have tunnel vision. Stay in that space until the right things comes along. \n\nAlso, don't be afraid to just try things. If I could go back I would have tried every possible option I could to see what I could learn from it. \n\nBut in all honesty, if you're looking into making good money and being successful, look into starting what people call a \"boring business\". Just google that term and you'll find content on these types of businesses. They are stable and needed. \n\nGood luck to you and just remember one thing - you have WAY more time to figure this out than you're probably thinking right now. I am 31 and still figuring out where I belong. Just try as many things as you can. That will help you find your direction. ",

A saying I love is, Do what you love, learn how your passion can solve the problems of others and the money will follow. \n\nFor example, If you love cars, and the idea of helping others and get experience looking at other cars, Start a Detailing buisness. Save up some money for a few months doing any Quick service like Taco bell, KFC or anything. Buy your equpment, A few flyers and start adding them to \"nice places. Brownie points if you document your process (never have to show your face) and get paid to clean and look at cars while getting paid for views on TT, Reels, YT Shorts. \n\nThats just an example but remember, Quick money leaves quick and Slow, intentional money builds wisdom! Also, your only around 18. As someone that is 34, I will say the fact that you went on this page to post this question is doing more then most 30 yr olds I know! Keep your head up high, Try new things, and remember, you miss every swing you dont take. \n\nP.S Im a Dir for an Ops company and Starting my own business and i started at Taco Bell for 3 years beforeeI got my first job. You got this! DM if you ever want any questions or just some simple guidance always willing to help! ",

It was an older woman with a cooking youtube channel. She wanted to start making money other than the tiny YT adsense payouts. \n\nI told her to record a cooking course, then I built her a landing page, set up some automations along with the course hosting platform and we launched it to her followers.\n\nThe sales started coming in, she made 50K off that launch and my 10% commission on that was not bad.\n\nAfter that I continued finding people with big followings and helping them launch a product.\n\nThe success was always ultra predictable unlike with meta ads.\n\nThink of it like a big dam that’s holding water (loyal followers). You just come in, help break the dam (by launching a product) and the sales start pouring in. And you get all the credit.\n",

And fake engagement can hurt reach long term.\n\nIf you want help, hire for content strategy or content creation, not “growth.” For example:\n• Someone to help you define a niche and angle\n• Someone to write better hooks and posts\n• Someone to design simple visuals\n• Someone to analyze what’s working in your space\n\nAffiliate marketing works when you build trust and consistent value. Growth hacks without positioning usually waste money.\n\nBefore hiring anyone, ask yourself:\nDo I know exactly who I’m targeting and what problem I solve?\n\nIf that’s unclear, no freelancer can fix it.",

Distribution is actually much harder than building, and if you aren't talking to potential customers from day one, you’re almost certainly building something nobody actually wants to pay for.\n\n\nReal success doesn't come from a \"big reveal\" on Product Hunt; it comes from one-on-one conversations where you provide value and prove you understand a specific pain point. If you aren't embarrassed by your first version, you probably waited too long to launch and wasted months on features that don't solve the core problem.\n\n\nValue isn't through your eyes, value is through the eyes of the customer. There are many people who come up to me, and most of them have a common question: How do I start? I have only one sane answer: sell something. You don't even need a product to start selling, you could sell emotions, respect and anticipation. \n\n\nLook, through all the scenerios I've seen in business, this is a really big lie.",

That single comment led to the Best Posting Time Analyzer, a feature that differentiates the tool at https://reoogle.com.

Vague positioning  \nEarly on, it feels smart to keep messaging broad so you don’t limit yourself. What it actually does is attract mismatched customers. That leads to:  \n\\-higher support load  \n\\-feature creep  \n\\-messy roadmap decisions\n\n2. Letting early customers dictate the product  \nYour first 5-10 customers are loud and influential. If you overfit to them without checking whether they represent your real market, you can drift fast.\n\n3. Not defining what a qualified customer is  \nWe once didn’t clearly define who the product was not for. Sales closed deals that looked good on paper but created longterm churn and operational drag.\n\n4. Poor data hygiene  \nEarly on, nobody cares about clean tracking. Later, you realize you can’t trust your metrics. Then every growth decision feels like a guess. Visibility into what’s actually happening we noticed this when working with tools like SyndrAI in another context becomes far more important than new features.",

The statement we can serve everyone seems harmless in the beginning but it creates problems with products which become excessively complicated and it causes sales processes which take an unending time to complete.  \n  \nThe main problem arises when companies set their initial product prices too low. The approach appears to be a strategic move, but it establishes your brand at an unprofitable level which creates difficulties for your company when you try to increase prices.  \n  \nThe process of onboarding needs to be skipped, which creates problems. Customers who join your company at the beginning will accept some level of difficulty, but ineffective onboarding methods will cause customers to stop using your service.  \n  \nThe small choices which determine how you will position your company and set prices and handle onboarding processes will create. You need to establish clear goals at the beginning of your SaaS project because this will help you avoid expensive changes during your development process.",

          "text": "Good question. It’s usually not the big mistakes that hurt, it’s the quiet small ones.\n\nOne is choosing the wrong ICP at the start. If you go slightly too broad, your messaging stays generic, your product roadmap gets messy, and support becomes chaotic. It feels small early, but it compounds fast.\n\nAnother is weak onboarding. If users don’t hit value in the first few days, churn becomes normal and you start blaming marketing instead of fixing activation.\n\nIgnoring tracking is another silent killer. If you don’t define what a “qualified user” or “success event” is early, you’ll make decisions based on vibes instead of data.\n\nAlso, underpricing just to get traction. Cheap customers are usually the most demanding and least loyal. That positioning sticks longer than you think.\n\nAnd one more that people underestimate: saying yes to every feature request. It slowly turns a focused product into a Frankenstein tool.\n\nMost businesses don’t collapse from one big wrong move. They drift because of small, uncorrected decisions repeated for months.",
