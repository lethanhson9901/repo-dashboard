      "text": "I import consumer electronics from China and sell to USA retailers. I mostly sell USB chargers and power banks, and do about $12M a year in revenue, with roughly $2.5M tied up in inventory.\n\nOne of my customers’ houses just burned down, and they’re claiming one of my USB chargers caused it, and now they’re demanding indemnification under our contract.\n\nThat’s when I found out something I honestly can’t believe I missed, as I have zero product liability coverage, and it’s excluded from my general liability policy.\n\nMy broker says I need $5M to $10M in product liability insurance, the quote came back at $48K per year. Until now, I was paying $18K total for our existing coverage.\n\nI get why it’s expensive, and that chargers and power banks are literal fire risks. My QC is sample-based, not 100 percent inspection, and while my Chinese suppliers claim they have insurance, I’ve never actually seen proof or been named on a policy.\n\nNow it’s really hitting me how exposed I am. One serious failure could wipe out everything I’ve built, and this isn’t hypothetical anymore, it’s happening.",

Anything that works early is usually something where someone can take a small risk on you and see value quickly.\n\nWhat I’ve seen actually work (and done variations of myself):\n\nFirst, I’d pick one skill that directly ties to revenue. Not “learning broadly,” not consuming courses endlessly. Something where the outcome is obvious to a buyer. Writing that drives leads, ads that drive sales, outbound that books meetings, and simple automation that saves time. The more measurable the outcome, the easier the first yes.\n\nThen I’d attach myself to someone who already has demand. Small business owners, founders, creators. Not by pitching services immediately, but by being useful. Fixing one thing. Pointing out one missed opportunity. Helping for free or cheap at first, just to get proof and confidence.\n\nCold DMs can work, but only when they feel human. The people I’ve seen succeed weren’t blasting templates. They were referencing something specific, asking smart questions, and having real conversations. Low volume, high intent.\n\nContent helps, but not as a growth hack. More as a credibility trail. Writing publicly forces clarity and makes it easier for opportunities to find you over time. It compounds slowly, but it compounds.\n\nWhat I wouldn’t do early:  \nDropshipping without a real edge  \nBrokerage without a network  \nAnything that depends on ads before cash flow  \nAnything that sounds “passive”\n\nThe pattern I’ve noticed is that people who escape zero usually do it by selling effort first, then slowly turning that effort into systems, products, or leverage later.\n\nThe unsexy answer is that it starts with trading time for money. The important part is choosing a trade that teaches you how businesses actually work and puts you close to decision-makers.\n\nCurious what your own conclusion was after the assignment.",

But I’ve also made a lot, and it’s changed my life for the better and opened doors. \n\nAlmost everybody has that restaurant itch; but be careful - not everyone should scratch it, and some need to be okay with never caving in (or maybe they can invest in a restaurant with discretionary funds, if you absolutely must but aren’t ready for the torture). \n\nMore important than the concept, make sure the franchisor is good people, have strong leadership, and you feel in your soul they want to take care of franchisees and want them to win. I can’t overstate this.",

For the right person, that pace is addictive in a good way. But you’re absolutely right. Not everyone should scratch the restaurant itch. It can look glamorous from the outside, but it’s intense.\n\nAnd your point about the franchisor is huge. The brand matters, but the leadership and how they treat franchisees matters even more. If the people at the top aren’t aligned with your success, it makes the journey a lot harder.\n\nThanks for sharing your story.

That’s powerful. You’re absolutely right: you’re selling reliability and trust, not trends.\n\nFood can look exciting, but the labor, waste, and thin margins can wear people down fast. Service businesses, on the other hand, tend to have stronger margins and more predictable demand if you build a solid team.

Lately I've been thinking about universal health care.\n\nI'm stuck at the \"monetizing it\" part. You need to find out what you're passionate about, and provide a solution to their problem. Then you can \"run the numbers\" as I like to say. You figure out what it costs to provide the solution (including every cost plus contingency), and then add your profit margin. That's your price. Now see if the market will bear it. Look at competitors or similar products. Who's your market? Do they / can they / will they spend on this?\n\nAs for scalability, if it's a viable concept it should apply to enough people to reach some kind of *critical mass* of operations.\n\nJust my two cents. Your mileage may vary.\n\nBTW, if you're 21, learn as much as you can about everything you can get your eyeballs on. So often later in life we \"discover our true passion.\" Some of that is maturity and previous life experiences. Some just bumbled into something they were really passionate about. \n\nSo much inspiration happens as you learn stuff.\n\nLearn as much stuff as you can.

Even something simple like building a basic tracker for a shop's inventory teaches you more than any business book. You learn what actually matters to people who are paying.\n\nCollege wise, I'd honestly look at programs that let you take classes across departments rather than locking into a pure business degree.

You're selling management consulting, with a proprietary tech product in your portfolio.\n\nHow many org designers do you have on staff? What process design experience do you have? Do you bring compliance expertise? What's your theory of customer experience design? Are you familiar with SCOR, spans of control, brand health metrics, evidence building & program evaluation, cost modeling?\n\nWith respect, there is no way that you, a developer, is able to offer that knowledge at 22 without backing from *decades* of others' experience. My typical team has, in aggregate, between 25 and 100 years of  subject matter experience in the relevant domains.\n\n>The moment you try to automate something, you’re forced to define triggers, outcomes, ownership and what happens if nothing happens. Most businesses avoid those questions.\n\nOr, you are not selling the outcomes they're buying. A good process that doesn't produce the outcomes you want is worth nothing next to a bad one that does. Nobody's problem is that they need automation. Every business's problem is that they need a cheaper and quicker way to deliver the outcomes their client wants. If your way is quicker and cheaper, but doesn't deliver the outcomes for their clients, then it actually isn't quicker or cheaper for them. \n\n>Automation doesn’t let you, it doesn’t scale chaos. It exposes it. [...] Humans focus on judgment and strategy, repetition belongs to systems and automation isn’t the final step after perfection. For many companies, it’s what forces structure in the first place.\n\nAgain, respectfully but this is a *terrible* value prop for your customers. You don't design the process to the tech. You design the tech to the (future state) process. And there are better, more reliable ways of exposing flaws in those processes than by melting them down with a piece of tech that won't work with what they're doing.\n\nI have deployed B2B connections at a Fortune 100 company, on behalf of the *only* vendor out of a dozen that was allowed to automate. We didn't use a ritzy product, we used python and a CSV file. You know why? Because we could demonstrate that our method would respect the integrity of their compliance-heavy process (including giving them the ability to manually intervene), and nobody else's proposed solution did. \n\nTech is never the answer, it is an enabler for the answer -- but you *have* to know the answer first.",

      "text": "Hey everyone, I’m early-stage and trying to figure out the right way to get my first consistent clients, so I’m hoping to learn from people here who’ve been through this. Here’s what I currently offer, very plainly: I help service businesses (local services, clinics, trades, etc.) turn more of their existing demand into actual booked customers. My team handles SEO and paid ads to bring in high-intent enquiries My partner handles automation (instant replies, follow-ups, basic qualification, booking handoff) The core problem we focus on is missed enquiries, slow replies, after-hours gaps, and no follow-up In short: We don’t try to get businesses more leads first we try to stop the leads they already get from slipping through the cracks. Where I’m stuck is client acquisition. I’ve tried: DMs and cold outreach offering audits / reports free automation ideas value-first conversations I’m getting replies, but converting that into paying clients has been inconsistent. So I wanted to ask people here who’ve built agencies or sold to service businesses: If you were starting from zero today, how would you get your first 5–10 clients for an offer like this? Is this the kind of problem owners say they care about, but don’t actually pay for? Would you position this as a standalone service, or bundle it with SEO/ads from day one? What mistakes do you see beginners make when selling to service businesses that I should avoid early? Not trying to promote anything here genuinely trying to avoid wasting time and build this the right way. Any blunt or critical feedback is welcome.",

Reframe the offer around revenue recovery, not systems. For example “we help you book 20–30 percent more of the leads you already pay for” lands better than automation or workflows.\n\nTo get the first 5–10 clients, narrow hard. Pick one vertical where missed calls and slow follow-ups are obvious like dentists, home services, clinics. Talk only to them. Generic service business messaging slows trust.\n\nSell this as a short pilot, not a full service. A 14 or 30 day conversion fix with a clear before and after is easier to say yes to than an ongoing retainer. Once results show, upsell SEO or ads.\n\nEarly mistakes I see all the time are over-educating, bundling too much too soon, and leading with tools instead of outcomes. Owners do not care about automations. They care about booked jobs and fewer leaks.\n\nIf you can clearly show “you missed X leads last month, here’s how much that cost you, we fix that first,” you will close faster.",

      "text": "If you’re thinking about taking the leap into franchising, here’s some hard-earned perspective from someone who’s worked with dozens of first-time owners.\n\nThe biggest thing I see people underestimate isn’t the upfront cost. It’s the day-to-day reality. Owning a franchise isn’t passive income. Even “semi-absentee” models require 10–15 hours a week just to manage payroll, vendors, and staff. That structure the franchise provides is helpful, but it doesn’t replace leadership.\n\nAnother surprise? Staffing. Hiring reliable people is harder than most expect. One bad hire can create headaches that ripple through your business and burn you out if you’re not careful.\n\nCash flow also comes as a shock. Even profitable units need reserves to cover unexpected costs, slow months, or marketing experiments. Thinking you’ll “break even quickly” is usually too optimistic.\n\nOn the bright side, the support from the franchise, training, systems, branding, is invaluable, especially if you’re coming from corporate. It’s like a blueprint, but you still need to execute it well.\n\nIf I could give one piece of advice to a first-time franchisee: go slow, plan meticulously, and test your workflow before scaling. Enjoy the process, celebrate small wins, and treat the business like a system, not a side hustle.\n\nFranchising can be incredibly rewarding if you go in with your eyes open.",

I think a lot of people come into it assuming that because of the brand name, everything will be automated, but in reality it is still very much a people-and-process business.\n\nThe staffing point really resonated with me. Most new owners focus on location, funding, or marketing, but the biggest challenge is often staffing and managing workflow. From what I have seen working with small business teams, owners who treat hiring as a system tend to experience less burnout than those who react to problems as they arise.\n\nI also completely agree about cash flow surprises. Even profitable setups can feel stressful when processes are not streamlined. Many newer franchisees have started automating smaller administrative tasks such as lead tracking, customer follow-ups, and reporting dashboards to protect their time. Once repetitive tasks are reduced, it becomes easier to think like an owner instead of an operator.\n\nThe biggest shift seems to be the “business as a system” mindset you mentioned. Scaling becomes smoother when people focus less on working harder and more on designing workflows that run consistently, whether through vetted freelancers, automation tools, or structured support models.",
