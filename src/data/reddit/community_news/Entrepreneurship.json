      "text": "I import consumer electronics from China and sell to USA retailers. I mostly sell USB chargers and power banks, and do about $12M a year in revenue, with roughly $2.5M tied up in inventory.\n\nOne of my customers’ houses just burned down, and they’re claiming one of my USB chargers caused it, and now they’re demanding indemnification under our contract.\n\nThat’s when I found out something I honestly can’t believe I missed, as I have zero product liability coverage, and it’s excluded from my general liability policy.\n\nMy broker says I need $5M to $10M in product liability insurance, the quote came back at $48K per year. Until now, I was paying $18K total for our existing coverage.\n\nI get why it’s expensive, and that chargers and power banks are literal fire risks. My QC is sample-based, not 100 percent inspection, and while my Chinese suppliers claim they have insurance, I’ve never actually seen proof or been named on a policy.\n\nNow it’s really hitting me how exposed I am. One serious failure could wipe out everything I’ve built, and this isn’t hypothetical anymore, it’s happening.",

Anything that works early is usually something where someone can take a small risk on you and see value quickly.\n\nWhat I’ve seen actually work (and done variations of myself):\n\nFirst, I’d pick one skill that directly ties to revenue. Not “learning broadly,” not consuming courses endlessly. Something where the outcome is obvious to a buyer. Writing that drives leads, ads that drive sales, outbound that books meetings, and simple automation that saves time. The more measurable the outcome, the easier the first yes.\n\nThen I’d attach myself to someone who already has demand. Small business owners, founders, creators. Not by pitching services immediately, but by being useful. Fixing one thing. Pointing out one missed opportunity. Helping for free or cheap at first, just to get proof and confidence.\n\nCold DMs can work, but only when they feel human. The people I’ve seen succeed weren’t blasting templates. They were referencing something specific, asking smart questions, and having real conversations. Low volume, high intent.\n\nContent helps, but not as a growth hack. More as a credibility trail. Writing publicly forces clarity and makes it easier for opportunities to find you over time. It compounds slowly, but it compounds.\n\nWhat I wouldn’t do early:  \nDropshipping without a real edge  \nBrokerage without a network  \nAnything that depends on ads before cash flow  \nAnything that sounds “passive”\n\nThe pattern I’ve noticed is that people who escape zero usually do it by selling effort first, then slowly turning that effort into systems, products, or leverage later.\n\nThe unsexy answer is that it starts with trading time for money. The important part is choosing a trade that teaches you how businesses actually work and puts you close to decision-makers.\n\nCurious what your own conclusion was after the assignment.",

But I’ve also made a lot, and it’s changed my life for the better and opened doors. \n\nAlmost everybody has that restaurant itch; but be careful - not everyone should scratch it, and some need to be okay with never caving in (or maybe they can invest in a restaurant with discretionary funds, if you absolutely must but aren’t ready for the torture). \n\nMore important than the concept, make sure the franchisor is good people, have strong leadership, and you feel in your soul they want to take care of franchisees and want them to win.

That’s powerful. You’re absolutely right: you’re selling reliability and trust, not trends.\n\nFood can look exciting, but the labor, waste, and thin margins can wear people down fast.

Here’s what I currently offer, very plainly: I help service businesses (local services, clinics, trades, etc.) turn more of their existing demand into actual booked customers. My team handles SEO and paid ads to bring in high-intent enquiries My partner handles automation (instant replies, follow-ups, basic qualification, booking handoff) The core problem we focus on is missed enquiries, slow replies, after-hours gaps, and no follow-up In short: We don’t try to get businesses more leads first we try to stop the leads they already get from slipping through the cracks. Where I’m stuck is client acquisition. I’ve tried: DMs and cold outreach offering audits / reports free automation ideas value-first conversations I’m getting replies, but converting that into paying clients has been inconsistent. So I wanted to ask people here who’ve built agencies or sold to service businesses: If you were starting from zero today, how would you get your first 5–10 clients for an offer like this? Is this the kind of problem owners say they care about, but don’t actually pay for? Would you position this as a standalone service, or bundle it with SEO/ads from day one? What mistakes do you see beginners make when selling to service businesses that I should avoid early? Not trying to promote anything here genuinely trying to avoid wasting time and build this the right way. Any blunt or critical feedback is welcome.",

Reframe the offer around revenue recovery, not systems. For example “we help you book 20–30 percent more of the leads you already pay for” lands better than automation or workflows.\n\nTo get the first 5–10 clients, narrow hard. Pick one vertical where missed calls and slow follow-ups are obvious like dentists, home services, clinics. Talk only to them. Generic service business messaging slows trust.\n\nSell this as a short pilot, not a full service. A 14 or 30 day conversion fix with a clear before and after is easier to say yes to than an ongoing retainer. Once results show, upsell SEO or ads.\n\nEarly mistakes I see all the time are over-educating, bundling too much too soon, and leading with tools instead of outcomes. Owners do not care about automations. They care about booked jobs and fewer leaks.\n\nIf you can clearly show “you missed X leads last month, here’s how much that cost you, we fix that first,” you will close faster.",

They struggle because everything is manual fragmented and tiring.\n\nFollow ups done later.  \nData copied between tools.  \nLeads falling through the cracks.  \nDocuments created from scratch every single time.  \nImportant things stuck in someone’s inbox.\n\nNothing dramatic just constant friction. And friction adds up fast.\n\nWhat actually changed things for me wasn’t some revolutionary product or viral trick. It was looking at my business and asking a very boring question.\n\nWhat am I doing over and over again that follows clear rules?\n\nThat’s where automation actually makes sense.\n\nNot flashy AI demos.  \nNot replacing people.  \nJust removing repetitive work that clearly doesn’t need human attention.\n\nThings like  \nAutomatic follow ups so opportunities don’t quietly die  \nLead qualification before someone spends real time  \nSystems talking to each other instead of spreadsheets  \nDocuments and invoices created from templates  \nInternal alerts so problems are caught early instead of late\n\nNone of this is exciting. But it creates something founders rarely talk about which is mental space.\n\nLess noise in your head.  \nMore consistency.  \nFewer things to remember.\n\nThe irony is that a lot of entrepreneurs keep chasing the next big idea while their current business is leaking time everywhere.  \nFrom what I’ve seen the businesses that scale calmly aren’t the most innovative ones. They’re the ones that reduce chaos first.\n\nCurious if anyone else here has gone through the same shift or if you’re still doing things manually that clearly shouldn’t be manual anymore",

Over the next year keep a mental note updated about how many times you read \"work smart, not hard.\" I bet you'll be able to count one -- just now when I mentioned it. \n\nEverybody else is grinding. Everybody else is crapping out a product market-blind, because they posted in a forum and got one vaguely positive response. They're ice-skating uphill. There's a reason that's not an Olympic event.\n\nI've asked people list the business books they're applying hundreds of times. No response yet. Of course they're doing everything the hard way. They can't learn from anybody else. \n\nPeople may agree. They may upvote. You probably just sent five hundred of them or so to develop a crap product to automate their own business, which they will then flog here *the instant that crap is done* regardless of suitability to task. What they won't do is work smart.",

Nothing's actually designed to run smoothly. They chase strategy when the real issue is that their business runs on memory and repetition\n\nAutomation isn't the full answer though. The question before \"what can we automate?\" is \"does this process even make sense?\" A lot of manual work exists because no one ever questioned whether it should exist at all.\n\nBut yes, the mental space thing is real.

When follow ups, handoffs, and basic ops are manual, the business feels heavy no matter how good the strategy is. Reducing friction creates momentum almost by default.\n\nThe mental space part is underrated too. Fewer things to remember means better decisions everywhere else.
