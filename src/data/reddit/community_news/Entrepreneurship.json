Many of the most successful startups are run by folks who are 45 according to HBR.\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2018/07/research-the-average-age-of-a-successful-startup-founder-is-45\n\nPersonally, the best advice I've received is to find something that you really enjoy and then get good at it.  By immersing yourself in a community you are exposed to the problems in that community and can help solve them.  For example, I work with a lot of small to medium size businesses in my day-to-day job and saw that many of them struggle to find smart, confidential experts who can help those business execs brainstorm and evaluate ideas from diverse perspectives. But the solution to that only came from being with people and talking to people all the time.  \n\nGood luck!",

One thing I like to encourage people with, is to really focus on your “why.” \n\nAnyone can jump into being a business owner, but I feel it’s the ones who really discover their “why” will not only have what it takes to push themselves towards success, but also can use their why to pull them out of the hard times and propel them forward. \n\nI would encourage you to check out Simon Sinek and his book Start with Why in part of your discovery process. Lastly, whatever I do, I like to focus on making meaning over money. Every time I follow this path it is great what I accomplish and I always make money along the way, because my passion comes alive! When I focus on how much money I’m going to make, nothing impactful ever is born and definitely no money is made.",

Not because it tells you what business to start, but because it clears up a huge misunderstanding most of us walk into entrepreneurship with.\n\nThe short version is this: being interested in business and being good at a skill are not the same as building a business that works without eating your life. That distinction alone can save years of frustration.\n\nAs for “where to spend time online,” I’d be careful there. A lot of spaces feel productive but mostly keep you consuming instead of building. Books and long-form thinking tend to give a better foundation early on than bouncing between platforms.\n\nCurious what pulled you toward entrepreneurship in the first place. Was it freedom, creativity, control, or something else?",

Note: Do not try to sell on the first call - it won't work.  \n2. Built relationships. Would strongly suggest that you get to know your local businesses - they all belong to similar organizations/clubs  and know each other - we began to receive regular referrals.  \n3. Niched down into a specific industry. Marketing, messaging, and referrals became much easier.  \n4. Stopped selling websites. Most business owners do not care about websites. They care about solutions and results so instead, my agency sold 'Marketing Solutions' (Packaged several services together to get them to the end result).\n\nOnce you get your process, offers and experience locked-in it will become easier to scale with partners, affiliates, and other complimentary businesses.\n\n  \nHope this helps!",

We are a small startup here in (\"Name of city\") and I'm reaching out to other business owners in the area to talk about (eg. \"Getting more foot traffic or how their getting customers - what's working or not\") --or -- I'm hoping to set up a quick call with you to talk about (\"Benefit you provide to common problem\").

      "text": "Sitting in on real conversations around small SaaS acquisitions changed a few assumptions I didn’t even realize I had.\n\nI used to think building from scratch was the “clean” option. Blank slate, full control, no mess. Buying felt like inheriting problems. But the more deals I watched, the more it made me think buying might be better than building.\n\nThe problems are there either way. The difference is whether you find them upfront or six months in, when you’re already emotionally and financially committed.\n\nOne thing I keep noticing, people don’t stall because there aren’t enough businesses out there. They stall because they’re everywhere at once. Marketplaces today, cold emails tomorrow, a new niche every week. After a while, everything blurs together and decision-making gets worse.   \n  \nSmart buyers tend to limit their niche down to few businesses which they are good at, this makes you more efficient and does’t waste your time exploring 10 diff niches. \n\nAnother thing, most of the important stuff comes out in conversation before it ever shows up in a spreadsheet. Metrics tell you **what** is happening. Talking to the founder usually tells you **why.** The timing, the burnout, the part of the business they’re tired of carrying, that context often explains the opportunity more than the numbers do.\n\nRevenue matters, obviously. But not as much as whether the product has crossed that invisible line from “side project someone tinkers with” to “something people quietly rely on.” That distinction alone filters out a lot of shiny distractions.\n\nAnd then there’s the part no one really talks about. The slow checks. The verification. The awkward questions. The walking away from deals that looked exciting at first glance.   \n  \nEvery buyer I respect seems to develop a weird tolerance for this stage. It’s not fun, but it’s where most bad decisions get avoided, and this is what you call Due Diligence phase. \n\nNone of this felt obvious until I’d seen a few deals up close, especially the ones that almost happened and probably shouldn’t have.",

In the literal sense - the business model, in theory (not proven or validated yet), is that businesses would pay for x amount of coffee cups to be printed and distributed with their brand and QR code/CTA on the coffee cup - the price of which would be higher than what it costs to print and distribute the cups - which results in profit (apologise if you didn't mean your question in the literal sense). \n\nIf you are questioning if it's financially viable, I have no idea - that's what I'm trying to figure out. This is very very early idea stage, so I'm speaking with as many people as I can to see if I can invalidate the idea before anything else. But it's reaching the point where we'll have to do a real-world test and see how it stacks up. Maybe this medium has a huge conversation and offers huge ROI opportunity for companies - I have no idea, it probably won't, but I don't have any data or insights to validate or invalidate that. \n\nBut I do absolutely take your point around being an inferior medium, and I agree, I think it is, but I guess it depends on the business/industry and a whole bunch of other factors. Nonetheless, I really appreciate your feedback and giving your opinion - it's helping me massively in terms of shaping (or binning) the idea - thank you!",

What that also means is precise communication and I suggest you learn pseudocode for project management. \n\nThe huge problem we face in this Business Forum is so few appreciate or understand business or what the business partner should be doing. It is not waiting around for the tech partner to finish the product. Because Build It And They Will Come has nothing whatsoever to do with business. \n\nI have recently witnessed the rise of the 'non-technical partner' which only means not anything else either. What's embarrassing is if they didn't code in some fashion, I really don't think they could describe what else they would be doing. Sure, filing for the corporate shell or some such. But really, this isn't a business forum. It's the amateur coders forum.",

Specifically, is there a single stack to handle them all?  Traditionally, for example, QuickBooks handled financials, Salesforce handles marketing and sales, and so on.  And the question to learn might be how to integrate them to enable the flow.  Today, there is a new kid in town, or AI.  You, the businessman, don’t need to learn how to do AI again.  But you do need to improve your assessment of which AI will help and perhaps grow your business along with the new IT evolving because of AI.",
