I did a couple of interviews and stuff and they basically cleaned up the mess I’d been making in my spreadsheets lol. Hours/week and scope were all upfront, so no surprises. It felt like having someone in the office without actually having someone in the office. tl;dr it saved me a ton of stress. 11/10 would recommend.

Oh, founders wish the world to marvel at what they invent. Truth is, once the team has it in their mind they are innovating they get disinterested in whether anyone outside the four walls of the startup gives a damn.\n\nDon't try to change the world unless you are sitting on a mountain of VC funding.\n\nIn practice however, not one 'never existed before' product actually disclosed stood up to seconds on a search engine. One guy's 'never existed before' was an alarm you put on valuables, like a laptop. Forget and leave it behind, an alarm sounds.\n\nIn seconds I found four of what looked to be dozens. Parents had been using them on wandering children for decades. Because I wasn't fixated on supply to the exclusion of demand. Search blindness comes with this malady.\n\nOP was depressed when he shouldn't have been. It would have taken little to survey available devices, then test against this niche. OP didn't care about market demand or solving a customer problem. He wanted to invent something. Now you know the real reason so few ideas are disclosed.\n\nI am sorry to disappoint wantrepreneurs the world over, but a startup is an economic experiment to prove a business model. Product-market fit is all that matters. And until money changes hands, you won't have a clue about product-market fit.\n\nOne guy told me he simply didn't believe in product-market fit. Bless his heart.\n\nLarger point being the modern era has grown quite fond of considering themselves above such awful considerations as money. Frankly many hate the idea of business, then they go and start one. Which goes just like that sounds it would.\n\nGet the damn money. Do not wait around for wantrepreneur christmas -- monetization day -- when the Capitalism Fairy grants your wish to become a real business.",

It’s not truly scalable up to a point and I’m kinda there and I also am at a stage of wanting to make money off my own music or not at all. \n\nI have many other passions such as self improvement/self help which I could turn into a YouTube channel. Fashion, finding a way for musicians to get paid fairly from platforms like Spotify. \n\nI then also want to find ways to utilise AI for stuff like faceless YouTube channels which seem to be popping up everywhere atm. I also do want to make time for my artist music career which I wanted to start this year instead of carrying on freelancing. \n\nHowever. I believe the financial gains will be a lot slower from music and I need stability. So my plan is to pursue another idea that will allow me to put money back into music to promote it (my true end goal). \n\nWith all these various ideas I have what wee the best ways outside of market research to condense them down and then execute? Shall I try to run multiple different ideas at one time for multiple revenue stream possibilities? Or focus on one? And what’s the best way to plan this all out before committing? Mindmaps or something similar? \n\nI am ADHD and find it easy to be passionate and have loads of great ideas but find it hard to know when to pull the plug and just commit to one idea before creating a further 10 10 mins later. I just want to find the best way to condense and commit and actually start executing one of my ideas. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated! Cheers ",

      "text": "Hi everyone! I’m developing a concept for Nairobi, that blends stress relief and wellness in one sanctuary. Imagine a lush green space with multiple rage rooms for safe emotional release, Zen spaces for calm and reflection, creative therapy corners (candle making, pottery, basket weaving), and soundproof rooms for crying or hugging huggable dolls. Guests can also talk to a therapist, walk a nature trail, all under one roof.\n\nThis is a new idea in my region, and I’d love to hear from those who have seen similar concepts in countries where mental health spaces are more established.\n\n* Do you think combining cathartic activities (rage rooms) with restorative ones (Zen, creative therapy) is beneficial or overwhelming?\n* What mental health considerations should I keep in mind to make this safe and supportive?\n* How can I ensure these spaces complement professional therapy rather than replace or contradict it?\n\nYour insights would mean a lot as I shape this project. Thank you!",

You’re figuring out the product, pricing, systems, and customers all at once, which can take time and money before things really click.\n\nThat’s why many people today weigh alternatives like proven models or businesses with built-in systems, especially if they want to reduce early mistakes and risk. Others love the freedom of building something entirely their own, even if it takes longer.\n\nThere’s no one right answer. It really depends on your risk tolerance, timeline, and how much support you want along the way.\n\nWould you start from scratch today, or choose a more structured path?",
