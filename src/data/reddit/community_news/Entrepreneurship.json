When you’re clear on what the business is, what problem it solves, and you’re already taking action, people are much more willing to help or collaborate regardless of your age.\n\nA few realistic points:\n\n* Start solo or with one collaborator, not a full team\n* Look for people who want to learn or build together, not employees\n* Be honest about your situation and limits. Serious people respect clarity more than confidence\n* Your age matters less than whether you’re consistent and reliable\n\nTeams usually form around momentum, not ideas. Build something small first. Once others see progress, getting help becomes much easier.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m looking for some realistic advice because I’ve been spinning my wheels a bit trying to get bookkeeping clients.\n\n**Background:**  \nI have a college diploma in accounting and about a year of combined experience (school + \\~9 months as a staff accountant/bookkeeper). I’m not a CPA, and I’m not trying to position myself as one. I’m aiming strictly at **basic bookkeeping** for small businesses (monthly books, reconciliations, cleanup, etc.).\n\n**What I’ve done so far:**\n\n* Set up a simple service offering (monthly bookkeeping, cleanup)\n* Reached out to small businesses locally (cold emails / DMs)\n* Posted in a few Facebook and Reddit groups (mostly ignored or very low response)\n* Talked to people I know personally (some interest, nothing converted)\n* Tried to keep pricing reasonable and transparent\n* I’m confident in my ability to do the work once I actually get a client\n\n**Where I’m struggling:**\n\n* Getting *any* traction or responses\n* People seem hesitant to trust someone without a CPA or years of solo experience\n* Competing with very cheap overseas bookkeepers and very established firms at the same time\n* Feeling like I’m stuck in the “need clients to get experience, need experience to get clients” loop\n\nI’m not expecting instant success or big money. I just want **my first few real clients** so I can build proof, testimonials, and momentum.\n\n**My questions:**\n\n* Is this just normal early-stage friction, or am I missing something obvious?\n* Where did your *first* bookkeeping clients actually come from?\n* Should I niche down harder (industry, software, cleanup only, etc.)?\n* Is it smarter to work under another firm first before trying solo?\n* Any mistakes you see beginners make that I might be making?\n\nI’m open to blunt feedback. If the answer is “this takes way longer than you think” or “you’re approaching it wrong,” I’d rather hear that now.\n\nThanks in advance to anyone willing to share real experiences.",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about young entrepreneurs diving into franchising. Buying a franchise in your 20s or 30s can feel like a huge leap. There’s the money, the responsibility, and learning a whole new business model all at once. But it can also be an amazing way to get into business with a proven system, support network, and structure that really helps you grow.\n\nFrom my experience helping people explore franchise opportunities, the ones who succeed usually pick something that fits their skills, interests, and lifestyle. That alignment makes all the difference between burning out and actually enjoying the journey.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who has done it. If you bought a franchise in your 20s or 30s, would you do it again? What surprised you the most, and what advice would you give to someone thinking about taking the leap now?",

      "text": "Most small businesses do not have a traffic problem. They have a visibility and trust problem.\n\nWhen someone needs a gym, clinic, salon, repair service, or restaurant, they usually do three things. They search on Google, open a few websites, and check social media pages. The business that looks active, clear, and trustworthy gets the call.\n\nHere are simple things any local business can do to get more customers consistently.\n\nFirst, fix your Google Business Profile. This alone can bring steady leads. Add real photos of your shop, team, and work. Write a clear description of what you do and who you serve. Add all your services, not just one line. Ask happy customers for reviews and reply to every review. This helps you show up higher when people search in your area on Google.\n\nSecond, make sure your website answers basic questions fast. Many small business sites lose customers because they are slow, confusing, or outdated. Your homepage should clearly say what you do, where you are located, how to contact you, and why someone should trust you. Even a simple, clean site works if it is clear.\n\nThird, stay active on social media in a simple way. You do not need viral videos. Post before and after work, customer feedback, your team at work, offers, and common questions customers ask. This builds trust. People often check Instagram or Facebook before calling.\n\nFourth, keep everything updated every month. Many businesses set things up once and forget them. Profiles get outdated, numbers change, offers expire. Regular updates signal that your business is active and reliable.\n\nNone of this is complicated, but most owners do not have time to manage it properly while running daily operations.\n\nI work with local businesses to set up and manage these things on a monthly basis so they get a steady flow of calls and messages instead of depending only on walk ins.\n\nIf you want, comment with your type of business and city, and I will suggest what you should fix first, even if you do it yourself.",

If the business you start would violate the terms of the non-compete, wait for the non-compete to expire. \n\nHonor your legal commitments. It’s not only ethical; it’s the smart thing to do. And you won’t lose sleep at night worrying that the word will get out and your petty former employer will make your life an expensive legal hell.\n\nSo I suggest that you either play it safe and wait, or else get a solid second opinion from another attorney, and if they think you wouldn’t be violating the agreement for some reason, at least get their opinion in writing.

Build your messaging, demo, and even outreach around that single moment.\n\nMost content tools fail early because they market “AI content” instead of owning one stressful job.\n\nIf you want, share what *specific situation* users come to you for right now, and I can help pressure-test that angle.",

Pure and simple, it's a way for neo-maxi-zoom-dweebies to eliminate human nature from software production *to the exclusion of all else.*\n\nAn obligatory survey posting that gets as little as three replies seems sufficient to satisfy the standard Build It And They Will Come venture. People are always posting to ask if three, six, twelve responses -- nobody paid but a moment's attention to fill out -- is enough 'market traction' to launch. They are ridiculous but consistent; I can't remember how long it has been since anybody *claimed to have* even twenty responses. \n\nAnd they didn't seem to see a problem until one dreadful minute of silence after launch. Yet their amazement seemed genuine. Seems getting into tech to avoid human nature sure can be a bitch when you need those bastards to buy your shit. \n\nDistribution is an interesting choice of word, full of meaning and forecasting, well ...profoundly disappointing outcomes. Want a real distribution \"problem?\" Put up a landing page and Buy Now button. If 32,468 people click in a reasonable time -- that's the problem you want to have.

And honestly, the scariest question is probably \"why you?\" I have investment banking experience, I understand this market, I've done months of research. But is that actually enough to build this thing?\n\nWhat do these meetings even focus on? Should I lead with the problem or jump straight to our solution? How deep should I go on the technical AI stuff versus keeping it high level? At this stage with no traction yet, are they looking more at the idea itself or trying to evaluate if I'm the right person to execute it?\n\nIf anyone here has pitched to incubators in GCC, what actually matters in that room?

      "text": "I have been analyzing the sports streaming market for the past eighteen months, and there is a massive opportunity that most entrepreneurs are completely overlooking. With World Cup 2026 coming to North America and streaming rights fragmenting globally, the barriers to entry have dropped while demand is exploding.\n\nThe major platforms like ESPN+, DAZN, and Paramount+ are fighting over premium rights to tier-one leagues. Meanwhile, there are thousands of regional leagues, college sports networks, amateur competitions, and niche sports that cannot secure favorable distribution deals. These content owners are desperate for streaming solutions but lack the technical infrastructure to launch platforms independently.\n\nHere is what makes this opportunity compelling right now. The technology infrastructure that once required millions in investment and entire engineering teams can now be deployed in weeks rather than months. The core components include live streaming architecture, content delivery networks for global reach, ad insertion technology, mobile applications, and payment processing systems. What previously represented an insurmountable barrier to entry has become accessible through modern platform solutions.\n\nThe revenue model is remarkably straightforward and proven. Ad monetization through pre-roll and mid-roll advertising generates the primary revenue stream, particularly when you can offer local and regional advertisers direct access to engaged sports audiences. Subscription tiers provide recurring revenue, while pay-per-view options work exceptionally well for championship events and premium matchups. Sponsorship overlays and branded content create additional streams, and for those willing to navigate the regulatory complexity, fantasy sports and betting integration can dramatically increase user engagement and lifetime value.\n\nThe timing creates a perfect storm of opportunity. World Cup 2026 will drive unprecedented demand for streaming infrastructure across North America. Emerging markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America are experiencing explosive growth in mobile-first streaming consumption. Regional advertisers want access to sports audiences but cannot afford the premium rates that major platforms command. Meanwhile, younger demographics have completely abandoned traditional cable and expect all content to be available on mobile devices.\n\nI have been working directly in this space, and the unit economics are stronger than most SaaS businesses if you can secure content partnerships. A regional streaming platform serving a single sport or league in a mid-sized market can achieve profitability within six to twelve months with proper execution. The customer acquisition cost remains relatively low because sports fans actively seek out content for their favorite teams and leagues.\n\nThe challenges are real but manageable. Content acquisition requires relationship building and often revenue-sharing arrangements rather than large upfront payments. The technical infrastructure, while more accessible than before, still requires expertise to implement properly. You need to navigate varying regulations across markets, particularly if you incorporate betting features. Competition exists, but the market remains fragmented enough that focused regional plays can succeed.\n\nFor anyone seriously considering this space, I recommend starting with a single sport or league in a defined geographic market rather than attempting to build a broad platform immediately. Establish partnerships with content owners who currently have no distribution or poor distribution deals. Focus on mobile-first development since that is where consumption is heading globally. Build ad monetization into your core platform from day one rather than treating it as an afterthought.\n\nI have been building solutions in this exact space through my work on sports streaming infrastructure. The technical barriers that once prevented entrepreneurs from entering this market have largely disappeared, which is why we are seeing an explosion of regional platforms globally. If you have relationships with sports content owners or understand a specific market well, this represents one of the most compelling opportunities I have analyzed in the streaming economy.\n\nI am happy to discuss the specifics with anyone exploring this space. What aspects of sports streaming or ad monetization would be most valuable to break down further?",

Looking for gaps in the content market is completely irrelevant today.\n\nThink about this as writing more for citations, than for individual pages to rank, because organic searhc results do not result in site visits anymore.\n\nWhen researching keywords, I would use Google Ads platform, then export results via CSV file, combine the sheets in Google Docs, and filter to look for low-hanging fruit, then aim for long tail keyword with low competition. \n\nInstead now, I write more for social media content strategy to link back to, strategic SEO, content marketing, and optimize for AI Overview citations, and LLM citations. This relies on similar info being cited as the same patterns are seen across platforms, and they build credibility, and thought leadership. \n\nI typically use Claude for editing advice, not to actually write or edit, but for editorial commentary. I also ask Claude to recommend which phrases to add internal link strategies to, within the frame of my website.\n\nI use Grok for up-to-date research, Gemini for image generation, Chat GPT for ideation occasionally, then Photoshop and illustrator for images and vector work.\n\nWhen doing deep research, I combine GPT, Perplexity, Grok, GeminI and Dlaude results from the same prompt. Then, I ask Chat GPT to summarize all info, and put it into a useful reference doc. Or, use a metaprompt to create lifelike content posts around a topic.\n\nWordPress and Divi Theme for content production and website layouts, and web development.\n\nSimple YOAST or AIO for OTF adjustments on pre-post optimization.\n\nDifferent images for mobile and desktop for fastest mobile loading speeds.\n\nWithin my plugin structure, I use a lot of caching, cache clearing njinx helper, CDN assistants, etc., for further optimization on delivery, mostly provided by agency hosting provider.",

Something that requires hand and eye coordination and dexterity.\n\nIf you're playing catch with a friend and you're talking about something you're passionate about, like some video game or something, you flow. You don't stutter or have pregnant pauses or anxiety, you also won't be dropping the ball and throwing poorly.\n\nThe goal is to be as smooth as a gravy sandwich.\n\nRepetition is the mother of all skill. If you prepare, you will overcome the anxieties because passion and reflex will take over.\n\nI used to gather my sales teams every morning before the bell rang. We had an assortment of dexterity based activities from boxing to ping pong. The room would be a murmur of noise of everyone, pitching. And fielding rebuttals and objections, isolating and overcoming, and then back in line with their pitches.\n\nYou also need to believe in whatever you're doing, where you'll never reach the point of being passionate about. I had my son do cold calling for my business kind of as an uncomfortable lesson. Picking up that phone took him almost an hour for the first time. He was like dad this is hard. Then, we worked on his script.He had it memorized because I told him he had to. He even had some of the objections and rebuttals memorized. But he stuttered and stammered, and his tone changed, and i'm warbled, he pregnant paused, he got tripped up if anything unexpected came his way.\n\nThen we started playing catch. I told him imagine that you've got a truckload of playstation 5s. You're your only job is to get rid of them by the end of the day. And you gotta sell them for twenty five dollars, apiece. Could you do it?\n\nHe was like hell yeah that's crazy! \n\nI'm well, that's the equivalent of what my company sells. We provide truck parts that are made with higher grid materials, improved and patented designs that shorten the installation time from forty five minutes down to 5 minutes. The parts are required consumable and universal. They go on every truck on the planet. The best part is we sell them for about 50+% less than anyone else in the world. \n\nPeople would be stupid not to buy my product. I know that, and I make sure they know that. \n\nOnce, he believed in what we were providing and he understood the price matrix. It became selling playstation 5s for $25.\n\nWe practice the script while throwing the ball and laughing and talking. Within an hour or so, he was smooth. He did regress a bit on the phone because his age. He was 14. He wanted to call everyone, sir.And make sure they're having a good day and none of that was in the script. \n\nIn 9 weeks he had landed 27 Southern Tire Mart locations, 15 new Speedco/Loves locations, and 11 independent repair shops. He made a few thousand dollars in commissions up front, and still sees about $75-$450 a month in residual commissions, 2 years later.",

I’ve had to keep raising my fee just to avoid taking on more work than I can handle.\n\nThis also works with businesses. Not because owners are dopamine-addicted like creators, but because they’re just old. For example, I work with a crane rental company that rents industrial cranes for high-rise construction. I help them find contracts for 15 cranes per year totaling roughly $6M in profit for them. My 5% commission on that is not bad.\n\nI guess ask me anything, just wanted to give hope to introverts still starting out. You don’t need to be public and exposed online to make money.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, my name is Jimmy and I'm 26 years old. I've been really struggling with money these past few years. I worked my butt off at my retail job and I've debated about going back to school to get a higher education but money has been really tight to pay for classes and tuition. My parents don't have long left and they're still working. It makes me really sad to see keep them working and I can't do anything about it but help pay the bills for our house that's not even under our names. Our house doesn't even have heat or ac so it was really hard trying to stay warm during this winter season. I want to help my parents retired before I'm 30. I want to earn a lot of money as quickly as possible and have them live a comfortable life since they've been working when they were just teens. Is there any wealthy individuals or entrepreneurs that would like to help me? I'm willing to learn and do anything for my parents. I would like to learn under a mentor and learn how to make passive money. I don't really care about earning money for me personally as I don't see the value in materialistic things. I just want to help my parents. Thank you for taking this time to read this essay of a struggling, desperate man. ",

And also: what if you don't become rich by the age of 30, then what? Are you quitting? What if you become rich at 40 or 50? If you want very fast money, then either go to the bank and take a loan.",

          "text": "Earning enough money in 4 years to help out your parents is a crazy challenge. Especially considering you have no money on your own and apparently no particular skills. \n\nYou should start with setting realistic goals (read about SMART method or something similar). Otherwise you are setting yourself up for failure.\n\nAlso, assuming your parents are not handicapped, their retirement is not your responsibility. You are 26 so I assume they are not in their 70s or 80s, and they can figure it out themselves. I imagine they can struggle considering your living situations but taking responsibility over other adults is something way beyond your capabilities. \n\nYou are indeed desperate but before you do any rapid moves, you should get your head straight. Just from reading this short story I can tell you are a mess, emotionally speaking. \n\nPeople like you are perfect scam victims. ",
