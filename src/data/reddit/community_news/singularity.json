There are plenty of entities that do just that and are very successful with it.\n\n>but as an American\n\nThis doesn't qualify you in any special way as I am sure you subscribe to reddit and pajama journalism and not business weekly or the economist.\nYou do not have to be Chinese to understand why China doesn't do it and as an American you have no special insight into why it's not done here (whatever the subject).\n\nThe issue:\n\nYou are not aware that there was ***already*** supply and just until the last year or so that supply became tight.  It became tight due to AI, which 4 years ago basically did not exist. (it also might come crumbling down soon)\n\nThe companies developing chips are few and far between because:\n\n1. That has been their core business for decades and they incrementally improved on proprietary tech.\n2. Supply and demand was met. <--------------- super important.\n\nAverage redditors gonna average. We here just look for boogeymen and blame, greed and profits rule all. Very few of us can see the forest for the trees and yet we go all poetic on the trees, those in the front row, virtually no one thinks beyond that.\n\n\nIn addition, chip development is an on time business and to enter the market you must be not only on time, but on date. You cannot enter with older tech and so the few keep going and few  invest billions to trillions and a decade or more into advanced fabs that are not going to guaranty anything. There is also no guaranty they could even do it.\n\nDo you have any idea how the current chips are made? It's MIND BLOWING. Truly.\n\nWhat I find quite amusing however is the duality of \"we must invest\" (usually a mix of government and business) and \"I need my UBI!\" here on reddit.\nOne of the reasons we do not spend tax dollars on this kind of thing or infrastructure like we should is everyone, and I mean everyone, has their hand out and if that hand does not get the cheese, the mice go crazy. \n\nOne of the other reasons that chip manufacturing isn't started here (high end I mean), other than supply, demand and future need, is the outlay, it has nothing to do with short term vs. long term profits, you cannot generate money out of thin air when funding a company for this, it takes actual liquidity, cash and a LOT of it.\n\nThere are only a handful of companies that could even attempt (Apple, Microsoft etc..) it but it's NOT their core business, so they do not even bother.\n\nIt's not greed, it's not profit, it's none of those things. But we say these things to feel smarter and more informed than we are and (virtually) no one on reddit will ever call someone out for berating unknown corporate boogeymen.\n\nSociety gets dumber when we upvote the empty hyperbolic comments and parrot.",

Well, that's for you to figure out.\n\nSo each moment the machine is running, there's 1 million individual things which has to work, and if one fails, then you halt the entire process until it's repaired.\n\n---\n\nSo, like, how do you plan out any of this?

But eventually, you hit a wall where it won’t go smaller because the wavelength of the light is too big. So you try lower wave length — blue light. That requires some new kind of laser source, but you get there eventually and now your prints are way smaller. Repeat this process every time you hit a wall where it can’t go smaller. The light source gets harder and harder to produce, but science has been working on this for a long time. ",

They also happened to buy US based lithography company SVG in 2001, which was pretty much the only US lithography capability at the time.\n\nAnd they’re also just one of the various niche vendors involved in the whole supply and manufacturing chain for silicon chips. The US and China are better served buying their equipment for their semiconductor fabrication plants than figuring everything out on their own, and that is the route that the US chip manufacturers will be taking. ASML could potentially be bought out or at least have a majority stake acquired by US interests, but with a market capitalization of $430 billion that seems unlikely.",

And you'd need to convince a hell of a lot of people to move there.\n\nChina may be able to eventually, given their ability to centrally plan and more or less force the human capital needed to move there. The US can't stomach the giant lift needed, nor the cost involved of doing all of this domestically (at domestic construction and labor costs).",

At best it described what needs to be done step by step, but if you would ask it to do that, it will fail miserably, and there is always a point where shit hits the fan so hard you can't even find the energy to straighten up the AI to finish the work, so half of the things it achieved impressively go to the trash bin.\n\nEdit: You downvoting isn't gonna change shit. I use Claude Code and Gemini almost daily and they are not even able to tackle challenging tasks let alone being ready for production. There is no fucking way Claude Code is being able to navigate Google distributed system (which I bet my ass is a mess for a human) They excel at writing tests though, I give you that.

If you are saying that it might magically find a way, sure, maybe. Still doesn't explain why anyone with a sane mind would ever leave AI for an hour for a task that has already been done.\n\nBut her other tweet pretty much explains it:\n\n>It wasn't a very detailed prompt and it contained no real  details given I cannot share anything propriety. I was building a toy version on top of some of the existing ideas to evaluate Claude Code. It was a three paragraph description.\n\n[Here](https://x.com/rakyll/status/2007255015069778303)\n\nSo basically she created a toy version of it just to get a \"feel\" for it. Which is **way different** from claiming \"it generated what we built in last year in an hour\"",

For something that takes longer, you want to be able to steer them along the way. That's just the reality of the tech at the moment.\n\nI actually don't doubt the tweet too much, but it's also going to be a case of them spending a year working on and trying to understand the problem they are trying to solve. So when they feed it to the LLM they have a massive headstart with a prompt that already covers most of the decision making. I don't want to understate the value of that, but it's also not unique to LLMs. Give a human person a perfect spec and they'll complete a task far faster than someone working with a lot of unknowns as well. The best is a mix of both and having human decision making enhanced by the speed of LLMs and there's no reason why that can't change in the future either.",

Scaling them required programmers to anticipate and code for every possible edge case, which is exponentially hard as complexity grows (the \"long tail\" of rare events).\n\n>“When, for instance, there was a car in front of us that covered up the road markings, and on the other side, the markings were washed away, then the lane identification feature had a problem.”[¹](https://www.politico.eu/article/delf-driving-car-born-1986-ernst-dickmanns-mercedes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20was%20a%20test,problem%2E%E2%80%9D)\n\nTesla FSD v12+ (including v14.2) replaced \\~300,000 lines of hand-written C++ code with a single, unified neural network that takes raw camera inputs (\"photons\") and directly outputs controls (steering, acceleration, braking).\n\nThis \"photon-to-control\" approach learns holistic driving behavior from data—handling nuances, context, and edge cases without explicit rules.[²](https://www.fredpope.com/blog/machine-learning/tesla-fsd-12)",

Almost all of the miles are on highways. Lots of cars can autonomously navigate highway exchanges.\n\nThis glosses over the hard problem that anyone but Waymo has been able to solve. Doing one trip without a disengagement is something I commonly do. The gulf between that and never having to disengage is unimaginably gigantic. That last 1% is 99% of the problem.\n\nThis \"accomplishment\" is a lot like the Turing test in 2023. A fully autonomous coast to coast trip was once a stated goal that Tesla promised that they could achieve. At the time it seemed almost impossibly ambitious. Like with LLMs and the Turing test, when the technology became capable of passing that test, it became apparent that it's not an interesting or useful benchmark at all.\n\nAchieving both of these goals was once thought to indicate the goals (level 5 autonomy or in the case of the Turing test, AGI) would be close.

Like, imagine a hypothetical chip with 512GB of VRAM, that's 2x as good as a Blackwell datacenter card.\n\nBuuuuuuut you can't network it to other cards (by some magical intervention. Maybe it only has a PCIe x1 connection or something silly).\n\nWell, sure, it's great as long as you need less than 512GB of VRAM, but it doesn't really matter for huge scale model training.\n\nIt's sort of the same thing. It's really hard to directly translate between them, but I'd say Nvidia GPUs and TPUs are roughly on par and trade blows in various areas. The winner depends more on the individual task and the programmer on hand to optimize them, IMO.",

Just as the neocortex can be out of sync with the limbic system, a company's leadership often doesn't know what's happening 'under the hood.' Even the left and right sides of the brain don't always talk to each other.\n\nI wrote the above myself. Then I asked gemini 3.0 flash to evaluate what I wrote.\n\n\nHere is the evaluation: \nThis is a fascinating analogy that aligns well with several theories in organizational behavior and neuroscience. It challenges the \"Rational Actor\" model—the idea that a person or a company makes decisions as a single, unified mind.\nHere is an evaluation of the claim based on how systems actually function.\n1. The Hierarchical Layering (The Brain vs. The Org Chart)\nThe claim suggests that the neocortex (rational thought) is often out of the loop regarding the limbic system (emotion/instinct). In a corporation, this maps perfectly to the divide between Formal Strategy and Corporate Culture.\n\n * The \"Neocortex\" (Executive Leadership): Sets the vision, writes the mission statement, and looks at data. It represents the conscious \"will\" of the company.\n\n * The \"Limbic System\" (Middle Management & Culture): This is the \"subconscious.\" It’s where the actual habits, fears, and office politics live.\n\n * The Conflict: Just as a person might consciously want to diet but subconsciously reach for a cookie, a CEO might announce a \"innovation strategy\" while the company’s \"subconscious\" (risk-averse middle managers) quietly kills every new idea to protect their KPIs.\n\n2. The Split-Brain Phenomenon (Left vs. Right)\nThe claim mentions that the left and right hemispheres don't always know what the other is doing. In neuroscience, \"split-brain\" patients show that the two halves can actually work toward different goals simultaneously.\n\nIn a corporation, this is known as Siloing:\n * Sales vs. Engineering: The Sales department (the \"right brain\" focused on external relationships) might promise a feature to a client that the Engineering department (the \"left brain\" focused on logic and structure) hasn't even built yet.\n\n * The Result: The \"body\" (the corporation) moves in a disjointed way because the communication channels between the \"hemispheres\" are restricted.",

If you look at the TPU architecture and the fact they use a more advanced fabrication process the rumors of them being 50% more efficient seems plausible.\n\nThe architecture does not require going back to memory nearly as often as the architecture that Nvidia uses.  Going to memory is extremely expensive.\n\nThen Google is using N3P for the TPUs.   While Nvidia is using 4NP.\n\nBeing so much more efficient means you get that much out of the same power, cooling, data center using Google versus Nvidia.",

It would have been impressive some years back, but we've seen lots of other companies show off a robot dancing on stage at this point.\n\nThen they showed a mockup of the supposed commercial version, which likely won't be able to do the same things as the prototype (if you look at the differences in design).\n\nBut the commercial version isn't ready for public display, and apparently isn't even ready for an actual video, so they released a CGI video of it walking around doing work.\n\nMaybe Boston Dynamics will finally manage to pull off something impressive.

It stands out because it's fast (25sec for 6sec video, multiple generations at once possible) and the quality is quite good within its limits (audio is trash, can't do \"complex\" story telling like Sora, but image2video can produce quite convincing results).\n\nIt only gets traction here because Grok is also integrated into Twitter and sending @grok a message on Twitter produces the answer publicly. But that's completely optional, Grok.com is just a chatbot webapp like all the other that doesn't automatically publish the results.\n\nNote that \"undressing\" here just means \"bikini\". Grok doesn't allow topless for uploaded image, only for full generations. And bikini images you can do with Google's Nano Banana too. \n\nAlso there are open source models that are even less censored than Grok and allow basically everything, just slower on generation and quality isn't quite as good.",

      "text": "I don't want to play the credentials game, but I've worked at FAANG companies and \"unicorns\". Won't doxx myself more than that but if anyone wants to privately validate over DM I'll happily do so. I only say this because comments are often like, \"it won't cut it at faang,\" or \"vibe coding doesn't work in production\" or stuff like that.\n\nWork is, in many ways, it's the most interesting it's ever been. No topic feels off limits, and the amount I can do and understand and learn feels only gated by my own will. And yet, it's also *extremely* anxiety inducing. When Claude and I pair to knock out a feature that may have taken weeks solo, I can't help but be reminded of \"centaur chess.\" For a few golden years in the early 2000s, the best humans directing the best AIs could beat the best AIs, a too-good-to-be-true outcome that likely delighted humanists and technologists alike. Now, however, in 2025, if 2 chess AIs play each other and a human dares to contribute a single \"important\" move on behalf of an AI, that AI will lose. How long until knowledge work goes a similar way?\n\nI feel like the only conclusion is that: Knowledge work is done, soon. Opus 4.5 has proved it beyond reasonable doubt. There is very little that I can do that Claude cannot. My last remaining edge is that I can cram more than 200k tokens of context in my head, but surely this won't last. Anthropic researchers are pretty quick to claim this is just a temporary limitation. Yes, Opus isn't perfect and it does odd things from time to time, but here's a reminder that even 4 months ago, the term \"vibe coding\" was mostly a twitter meme. Where will we be 2 months (or 4 SOTA releases) from now? How are we supposed to do quarterly planning?\n\nAnd it's not just software engineering. Recently, I saw a psychiatrist, and beforehand, I put my symptoms into Claude and had it generate a list of medication options with a brief discussion of each. During the appointment, I recited Claude's provided cons for the \"professional\" recommendation she gave and asked about Claude's preferred choice instead. She changed course quickly and admitted I had a point. Claude has essentially prescribed me a medication, overriding the opinion of a trained expert with years and years of schooling.\n\nSince then, whenever I talk to an \"expert,\" I wonder if it'd be better for me to be talking to Claude.\n\nI'm legitimately at risk of losing relationships (including a romantic one), because I'm unable to break out of this malaise and participate in \"normal\" holiday cheer. How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies: most are a reminder of just how load-bearing of an institution the office job is for the world that we know. I am not so cynical usually, and I am generally known to be cheerful and energetic. So, this change in my personality is evident to everyone.\n\nI can't keep shouting into the void like this. Now that I believe the takeoff is coming, I want it to happen as fast as possible so that we as a society can figure out what we're going to do when no one has to work.\n\nTweets from others validating what I feel:  \nKarpathy: \"[the bits contributed by the programmer](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20) are increasingly sparse and between\"\n\nDeedy: \"[A few software engineers at the best tech cos told me that their entire job is prompting cursor or claude code and sanity checking it](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2000472514854825985?s=20)\"\n\nDeepMind researcher Rohan Anil, \"[I personally feel like a horse in ai research and coding. Computers will get better than me at both, even with more than two decades of experience writing code, I can only best them on my good days, it’s inevitable.\"](https://x.com/_arohan_/status/1998110656558776424)\n\nStephen McAleer, Anthropic Researcher:[ I've shifted my research to focus on automated alignment research. We will have automated AI research very soon and it's important that alignment can keep up during the intelligence explosion.](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/2002205061737591128)\n\nJackson Kernion, Anthropic Researcher: [I'm trying to figure out what to care about next. I joined Anthropic 4+ years ago, motivated by the dream of building AGI. I was convinced from studying philosophy of mind that we're approaching sufficient scale and that anything that can be learned can be learned in an RL env.](https://x.com/JacksonKernion/status/2004707758768271781?s=20)\n\nAaron Levie, CEO of box: [We will soon get to a point, as AI model progress continues, that almost any time something doesn’t work with an AI agent in a reasonably sized task, you will be able to point to a lack of the right information that the agent had access to. ](https://x.com/levie/status/2001888559725506915?s=20)\n\nAnd in my opinion, the ultimate harbinger of what's to come:  \nSholto Douglas, Anthropic Researcher: [Continual Learning will be solved in a satisfying way in 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9pof/anthropics_sholto_douglas_predicts_continual/)\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of anthropic: [We have evidence to suggest that continual learning is not as difficult as it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9og6/continual_learning_is_solved_in_2026/)\n\nI think the last 2 tweets are interesting - Levie is one of the few claiming \"Jevon's paradox\" since he thinks humans will be in the loop to help with context issues. However, the fact that Anthropic seems so sure they'll solve continual learning makes me feel that it's just wishful thinking. If the models can learn continuously, then the majority of the value we can currently provide (gathering context for a model) is useless.\n\nI also want to point out that, when compared to OpenAI and even Google DeepMind, Anthropic doesn't really hypepost. They dropped Opus 4.5 almost without warning. Dario's prediction that AI would be writing 90% of code was if anything an understatement (it's probably close to 95%).\n\nLastly, I don't think that anyone really grasps what it means when an AI can do everything better than a human. Elon Musk questions it [here](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/musk-predicts-ai-create-universal-high-income-make-saving-money-unnecessary), McAlister talks about how he'd like to do science but can't because of asi [here](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/1938302250168078761?s=20), and the twitter user tenobrus encapsulates it most perfectly [here](https://x.com/tenobrus/status/2004987319305339234?s=20).",

However, none of us has a crystal ball with 100% accuracy. There are almost always externalities our outside context we can't predict.\n\nBy allowing ourselves to stand at the precipice of uncertainty, and contemplating the possibility of a positive outcome (even if low it's still possible and that's what matters) we can undo the negative prediction and substantially reduce associated anxiety. The outcome may still be bad, but if it was going to happen anyway feeling less anxious only helps you manage better throughout and in the aftermath.\n\nI've adopted this protocol and try to apply it anytime I feel anxiety creeping in.

How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies\n\nThis seems like the problem.\n\nHere's my advice:\n\nNext time you have several days off of work, go camping by yourself. Drive out into the woods or desert, someplace with _no people_ at all. Not close enough to talk to, not close enough hear, not close enough to see them. Trees and dirt, that's your company. Bring a tent, a comfortable chair, a sleeping bag, bring water and simple/boring food that doesn't require cooking, but _nothing_ to entertain yourself with. No books, no toys, no mobile devices, no cameras, no radios...nothing.\n\nGo out there, camp in the middle of nowhere, by yourself. And this is important: _Turn off your phone_. Leave it in your car, and _don't touch it_ until it's time to go home. Spend a couple of days, by yourself, with nobody else, and no distractions. No youtube. No reddit. No social media. Just you, by yourself, with the sun and the sky.\n\nWhat do you do? Nothing. _The point of this_ is to do nothing. You're allowed to think, but don't sing, don't talk, not to yourself, not to anybody. You're allowed to eat, but don't distract yourself with food. Don't plan for the future, stay in the now. _Be alone with yourself_. \n\nAnd do...nothing.\n\nDo nothing, while nowhere...for three days.\n\nWhen you come back, all of the things you're worrying about now will seem small and unimportant.",

You can have an idea of this... but nobody actually knows, lack of safety. \n\nOur human minds get caught in a survival loop trying to figure out how to survive this new threat and there's never been a threat like this before...so we just keep looping on \"what do I do, what do I do?\" If you're an engineer you likely started by trying to tame the fear by gaining control over AI technologies, telling yourself \"AI can't write production code, it still needs a human in the loop\". \n\nIf your the sort of engineer that sees the inevitable you went a step further, you didn't stop at AI assistance, you kept pushing the boundaries of what AI could do, and had it code prosthetics for itself in order to make it do more things. As you were learning and practicing with AI, AI got better in mind blowing ways every month while you were still just learning... so even skilled developers find themselves, learning and re-learning, and adapting to an entire system change almost monthly as the way you build things with AI yesterday is not the same as you build it today.  \n\nYou find yourself reorganizing your custom AI coding configuration to do more and more, encompassing more autonomy... and realize the writing is on the wall.  That's where the depression comes in, right next to all the excitement gained from automating things that have never been automated before. \n\nI really hope becoming as much an expert in methods of building will carry through to the future, but I can also see it being futile. Tons of effort that's just wasted as soon as AI truly doesn't need us in the loop anymore, which seems way too soon.

When we only had Sonnet, I was initially very excited but then realized for production use cases where others would be reviewing my code, I had to do a lot of work cleaning up outputs and settled on the tab-completion model as the best way to speed up work (Karpathy landed at the same).\n\nWith Opus though, it's different. I have to force myself to ask myself, can Opus 1 shot this? before starting any piece of work, and most of the time, it can. The only issue is for now, Opus can't infer my intent. The limiting factor is not that Opus can work for 4 hours, it's that I can't specify a task well enough that would take more than 30 minutes to do without changing my mind after reading the code or similar.\n\nNow I could build work arounds for this, or try to mess around with agent rules or similar, but my hunch is that all of it will be made useless with the next mode drop and the speedup isn't worth it (for now). I bet the next Claude will ask perfect clarifying questions, or better yet, be able to turned unstructured user feedback into something actionable. It's very likely that the next iteration of claude will prompt YOU (and you can see that in the feature that they built in cc where it suggests the next prompt).",

Most people who argue that the have-nots will still be treated like crap think about this in a context with scarcity, when that is precisely the thing that has been eradicated, at least materially. Assuming abundance, everyone should have more than what they will need. \n\nMy bigger concern will be about the incumbent political system and its benefactors, and how they will attempt to hold on and maintain power. All political systems have been formed under this assumption of scarcity, and one of their main functions is redistribution. Without material scarcity, there ceases to be a reason for their existence -- at least of the political systems we have in our current form. In reality though, the politicians will try everything they have to hang on -- to maintain influence over other humans, possibly what is one of the truly scarce things left in such a world -- and I imagine that wars and conflict will inevitably happen.

I'm sure we've seen just how far even a middle management position can go to someone's head, but thankfully, that's constrained to the workplace for now.

There are plenty of work options out there still.\n\n\nMy hot take: LLMs look godlike in software because software is a symbolic, text-based, closed world with tons of training data and clear feedback (tests pass or fail). That massively flatters current models.\nReal-world engineering (EE, mechanical, systems) is the opposite: it’s physical, high-context, full of tacit knowledge, messy tradeoffs, and requires asking the right questions, not just answering prompts. It decomposes into thousands of domain-specific micro-tasks that don’t generalize well and don’t have clean reward functions or benchmarks.\n\n\nSo no, we’re not close to automating most real-world engineering jobs. This isn’t just “needs more data”, it’s a missing paradigm problem. The Bitter Lesson is being misapplied outside domains with clean rules and simulators.\n\n\nAI will keep being an amazing assistant (I use it daily in electrical engineering), but outside of software, “AIs replacing engineers” is mostly a Silicon Valley halucination driven by overfitting to the software engineer's worldview.",

That's why there is a growing literature where reducing working hours somehow seems to boost productivity.  \nFor those on a salary (in comparison to contract hours), there is also an ambiguity of work expectations. People fear being called lazy if they work less - even if as in the former point it results in higher productivity - and most work is performative rather than real, i.e. looking busy than actually being busy.  \nIn developing countries especially, people cannot afford not to work. Not because they cannot afford to live if they don't, but rather because if they do not work longer and harder, then they will be replaced. This is particularly the case in China where overworking is considered the norm and you cannot simply decide to clock out when the work day is over.  \nAs many others have commented on similar posts, humans will always create scarcity, even artificially if necessary. In a sense we're living in post-scarcity right now, or should be. Yet why is there hunger and homelessness in developed countries? We have the resources, but \"economic barriers\" prevent equitable distribution. We think we \"have to work\" to simply put food on the table, but that is no longer true. It is a borderline mental disorder to claim in our current economic situation that we MUST work when the capital (built on alienated labour) already exists to cover all the basic necessities we need.   \nOf course, I do not mean that we can simply not work in every sense. I just mean, that our obsession with work is perhaps the greatest hurdle that keeps us working to live, when we could instead live to work on our hobbies, passions, past-times, etc.",

Many people I talk to still haven't even tried Gemini or Claude. All they know about gen AI is via chatGPT; they don't notice much difference when a new model drops, because they haven't experienced the true power of agentic tools like a Cursor/Codex and the unlock that happens when a more capable model is suddenly plugged into it. So they remain AI skeptics. They still talk about what college they want their kids to go to, as if things will look the same in 15 years time. \n\nMy focus now is to stay on top of new advancements and tools. There should still be some time that  companies need people like us that are quick to adopt and apply new AI tools. I am still hopeful that being managers of agents will be in demand for a few years.

          "text": "Psychiatrist here. Your degree of fear of uncertainty about the future and ongoing existential angst  do make me wonder if there is a component of amygdalar hijacking secondary to chronic stress leading to HPA axis dysregulation which influence your narrative of your lifeworld. \n\nI'm glad you are seeing a psychiatrist but I hope you also understand that medication is likely not going to eliminate the source of your mental distress which is the perceived short-term and long-term threat to your psychosocial stability. There is likely some level of confirmation bias influenced by your pre-existing personality tendencies for intellectualization and striving for perfectionism although I can't say this for sure unless I get to know you better. \n\nI think it will be reasonable to consider intensive CBT (with a clinical psychologist, if possible) as part of your treatment. Trying CBT with AI may not be a bad start either given how great they are at socratic questioning now. I sense that you may have developed some rigid core beliefs and reduced cognitive flexibility which are contributing to the perceived short-term and long-term threats.\n\nSome probing questions: you mentioned that the psychiatrist quickly changed their suggestion given your input which was formulated by a GPT. Do you know for sure that the AI \"outsmarted\" your psychiatrist? I ask this because this experience have somewhat solidified your belief that AI is more of an \"expert\" than human experts.  An important component of choosing which psychiatric med to try is the patient's perceived sense of efficacy of the medication. Some may brush this off as placebo, but this sense of efficacy provides several dimensions of psychological protection (of external locus) including a sense of new hope that they are on a medication, that they are being followed by a mental health expert, and that even if their life circumstances are terrible, the medication could at least somewhat correct things. These thoughts ultimately provide a sense of stability which, when combined with the sertonergic effects of the medication which dampens HPA axis hyperactivation, can lead to the acute treatment of dysregulated anxiety reaction. Without digressing further, my point is that your psychiatrist being open to trying your suggestion may have been intentional. \n\nAnother question: What does it mean by being an \"expert\"? I recently wondered about this question after quickly realizing that AIs can easily regurgitate the 1st, 2nd, 3rd line treatment options of any psychiatric disorders. After some reflection, I learned that starting a medication is only a small portion of what I do. What makes me an expert in my job is my willingness to connect and walk along with my patients with integrity and compassion no matter how complex their biopsychosociospiritual problems are. A big part of psychological healing comes from feeling heard and acknowledged by another human being. (On a side note, philosophically I dont think AI can ever achieve this level of \"connectedness\" even if we had Cortana from Halo or Jarvis from Ironman because we are fundamentally an organic being, and GPTs are not, at least yet).\n\nI think it is obvious to most of us that another Luddite Movement is somewhat inevitable. However societies have survived it once, and they will likely survive it again. We won't know how until we cross that bridge. In the meantime, I think we can try to reflect on what is something that is inherently human or will take AI a much longer time to master and develop our career paths in that direction. For those who struggle with a sense of impending doom, i think this could be one approach to developing cognitive flexibility.",

However, our value system doesn’t change with it. We can look at physical works. Machines right now can lift heavier, run faster and do a lot that humans cannot compete, and yet we still put tremendous value on one human being running a few seconds faster than another human being, we still value physical strength so even if AI in the future, we will still value arts, novels, techs, music or movies that are produced by strictly humans.

That's not how higher intelligence works. They'll have logic-based emotion, I'm sure, but still have some form of it. At the very least a sense of survival.",

I am not a software engineer, but have been a research scientist for computational neuroscience for much more than 10 years at top institutions. I am in the rare position to somewhat be able to compare AI with humans.\n\nThe problem is roughly this… Here is your brain: 10\\^11 neurons x 1000 synapses per neuron x 100 operations per second = 10\\^16 operations per second.\n\nBUT: 90% of neurons are in the cerebellum or subcortical and contribute minimally to ”higher cognition“. In addition there is a huge redundancy in the code being used in the brain due to biological noise (probably 10x - 100x) AND the code is extremely sparse. If you would make it dense, you could probably crank out another 10x-100x speed factor.\n\nSo where do we end up? Realistically: 10\\^12 operations per second for a human brain. Synapses can do 4 bits, no more. The DGX Spark from NVIDIA for $4000 can crank out 10\\^15 FLOPs 24/7. Let this sink in.\n\nEssentially: it’s over. I am not talking about how much LLMs improved, or any kind of new algorithm, or that we will solve continual learning soon. I am talking simply about hardware that exists right now. And the algorithms that make this DGX Spark perform at its limits WILL BE FOUND. If not by us, then by us and AI, or as you pointed out: by just AI. In addition, brain “algorithms” are nowhere near optimized, neither for survival, and especially not for the modern world. Unlike insects, neurons in mammals are mostly connected randomly.\n\nWhere are we going towards: currently models improve at a rate of 20-30 IQ points per year (see Mensa Norway test) on a ”jagged frontier“. I am not saying that the Mensa values are REAL IQ, because the skill boundary is very jagged. Just that you can see the speed of improvement.  I believe this will keep going, if not accelerate as soon as we get the „booster“ of recursive self-improvement. This time we won’t get stuck in some AI winter, this time there will be no wall, this time we march on relentlessly all the way to ASI 🚶‍♂️. And you know it in your heart.\n\nWhere does this lead us?\n\n\\-2029: computational AGI\n\n\\-2030-2032: embodied AGI\n\n\\- 2035-2040: Each AGI controls hundreds of little dirt cheap ”gripper robots“ or camera augmented machinery like a juggling master (like a boss 😎), making most of physical work unnecessary.\n\n\\- 2040-2045: The IQ of those models will be so high, their thinking so fast, that we are mere „trees“ compared to them.\n\nWhat to do? Chill.. get a hobby… photography, botany, study something new at university (art?). Reduce work time or completely quit. Because nobody will give you back the time. Don't wait for total replacement of human labor and hope this is the end of story and we will live in paradise. Those things will keep improving by 20-30 IQ points a year through that period and keep going and going. The AI in 2040 will be such incredible monsters, making all relevant decisions for us (because they are better at it)… you can’t tell where this is headed from that point onwards. So take back control of your time, your thoughts, your emotions, your life NOW. Don’t let it be controlled by some random corporation.\n\nSO ENJOY THE TIME NOW RATHER THAN LATER!",

Some of these ideas are ingeniously simple, but someone had to come up with them and also pursue them. It doesn't matter if someone else would run laps around them in terms of skill and technical finesse if that person is busy doing completely different things and has no interest or stake in the idea at all, whether they are incredibly capable on their own or have supercharged their abilities through the usage of LLMs.\n\nLLMs of course lower the barrier of entry quite considerably, especially with purely software-based ideas, but they will not magically come up with all the ideas that could be possibly derived from our present and future body of knowledge and skills. It may sound trite, but if there's something that has always interested you but which seemed far too daunting to approach, now is probably as good a time as any to have a go at climbing that mountain, given how much friction is removed and how much preliminary information can already be obtained through a very casual interaction with an LLM.",

Apart from the obvious problems with it (like concentration of power, elites' resistance to wealth redistribution, etc.) I find myself wondering what the transition phase should look like. \n\nIt's not like all jobs will be redundant at the same time and a new social system based on UBI will be established as a consequence. The jobs that will be affected first (knowledge work, especially in the software sector) are often the best paying ones (which ironically makes them particularly vulnerable to job cuts) and those that require the highest level of education. This means that there may soon be a large \"useless class\", for lack of a better term, of highly educated young people, who are used to a high standard of living. \n\nUBI will not even begin to adequately compensate for that. People in other fields like healthcare, social services, skilled trades, etc. will (understandably and rightfully) demand to be compensated well above UBI. Just look at how the working class thinks about the unemployed, especially in countries with a strong social net. Unless there's a major redistribution of wealth from the elites to the middle and lower classes (not gonna happen), the new useless class will most likely be not much better off than the currently unemployed - despite UBI. \n\nReskilling to other fields doesn't work for several reasons: First, there are not enough open positions for everyone. Second, former knowledge workers will be at a huge disadvantage in those new positions due to a lack of experience and in many cases a lack of talent. And third, it's likely only a matter of time before many of these jobs will be cut as well and it's back to square one.",

That just means that the most responsible way to use LLMs is as hardware accelerators for aggregating information, not true replacements for humans - and that's good news.\n\nRight now a ton of AI discourse commits a huge category error: assuming that “can do X better” implies “should replace the human who currently does X.” Nothing about the shape of ML makes that natural law, and in fact we're probably going to shift to a paradigm of thinking about humans as convenient, efficient, embodied platforms for distributed cognition.\n\nAs the psychological and embodied ground truth upon which ML is built - and without which it could not exist - we humans are where goals, norms, and responsibility actually live.

That said, I want to push back on one specific conclusion - \n\nThe mistake isn’t believing that most knowledge work as we’ve defined it is nearing the end. It probably is. The mistake is assuming that meaning, agency, or social value was ever cleanly tied to being the best optimizer. That was always a fragile bargain and we’re watching it break.\nWhat is still under our...human control...right now, and very much not guaranteed later, is how these systems are shaped, constrained, deployed, and socially metabolized. Not at the level of “who writes more code,” but at the level of norms, interfaces, incentives, institutions, and values. That work is messier, slower, and political. Which is also deeply human. But, hey if Opus 4.5 is writing more of your code...maybe you can find more time to play public advocate. I'm a mechanical engineer...no one is asking me for software opinions, but you? FAANG employees are the ones we need advocating for where humans fit in the new reality being written - right now.\n\nPeople like you, who understand the systems and are honest about the existential fallout, are exactly the ones who need to stay engaged, not retreat into accelerationist despair or ironic detachment. Not because optimism fixes depression (it doesn’t), but because abdication guarantees the worst-case path.\n\nIf you want frameworks that actually grapple with this - The Coming Wave and Life 3.0 are solid entry points for what survives when capability explodes.\n\nNone of this makes holiday cheer easier. But it does suggest this: the future isn’t asking whether humans can outperform machines anymore. It’s asking whether we can still decide what counts.\n\nAnd for now, at least, that question hasn’t been automated away.",

I was using Gemini as a 1M token cache for opus 4.5 but it was expensive so switched over to nemotron even though it's slower. All of this is to say there are some nice workarounds for that tiny context window. \n\nPeople have no clue what's coming. Humans can't think in terms of exponentials, let alone exponentials on top of exponentials. But this is all an inevitable conclusion. From the first tool that gave humans the advantage in the war of all against all there has been a nonstop march of more and more technological augmentation. Shoes, glasses, air pods, cars, buildings these are all just manifest technologies. We came, we saw, we conquered. All of modern life is predicated on automation by the alpha predator.\n\nIf we take the AI out of the equation there is nothing sustainable about the current paradigm. Nuclear war, climate change, peak oil, and a million other existential threats. You drive around palo alto or san mateo or bellevue and we think \"this is normal\". We drive to work and park our cars and walk into the building and scan our badges, make small talk, log into our terminals and we think \"this is the way it's supposed to be\". \n\nMy financial advisor told me to save half a million dollars for my one childs college education fund. Billions of animals are raised in horrific conditions only to be slaughtered, fried and devoured flesh from the bone. We're wage slave surfs mind controlled by late stage capitalism to deny our own condition while at the same time desensitized to the inherent and required exploitation that is necessary to maintain our quality of life. Is this what we're so worried about letting go of? \n\nI happen to agree with Kurzweil; the stage of development we are at right now is on par with the development of the neocortex. This just so happens to be taking place during the sixth great mass extinction. None of this is normal. Five hundred years ago the nomadic people that inhabited the area around San Francisco lived primarily on a diet of forged acorns, as did the same people five thousand years ago. That was normal. This, what we have here, this is not normal. \n\nAnd it just keeps getting weirder and weirder the more you look at it.",

          "text": "While I share some of your worries, I don't foresee a near (or even a decade or two) future without \"programmers\".\nI agree and fully accept that my work has become more focused on controlling the agent and how the system and my actions affect its output, than manually writing code, which I almost don't do.\nIn the other hand, I do read a lot of code, specially tests, and discuss a lot of infra, systems architecture and security with my peers in order to protect the invariants of a continuously changing system.\nTrust in the local computational logic representations and their alignment with implicit and explicit requirements is something that requires human trust and deferring that completely to an agent will only happen either in very small size, very low impact software, or in a time in the future where we have cheap aligned AGI.\n\n\nI say that it requires cheap aligned AGI because even if we had an agent \"powerful\" enough to fulfill a prompt like \"build Instagram\" it requires the agent to make a lot of decisions and/or ask a ton of clarifying questions that either whoever prompted that doesn't have, so that person has to trust the final black box artifact, or if they have the knowledge to read the code, they ARE reading code and still using their \"programming skills\".\n\n\nThink about it this way. In a FAANG a lot of software already exist, and that software is probably (hopefully) written following practices like DDD (reduce ambiguity), TDD (fixes logical invariants), architectural patterns that increase cohesion and reduce coupling by encapsulation of sub-domains entities and their responsibilities (reduces context). Plus strong static analysis, CI/CD practices, ephemeral environments for stakeholder validation. On top of that there are teams completely dedicated into turning users behaviour into detailed and specific requirements for the software, using the ubiquitous language and leaving small room for ambiguity and uncertainty.\nIn an environment like that a developer is already reduced to \"write this small specific piece of code, inside this box, iteratively, using evolutionary design\", so of course coding agents thrive there.\nBut that system didn't spawn out of thin air, and also the changes being done still need to be trusted. Very likely that the number of FAANG engineers will be reduced, especially if running LLMs gets cheaper and cheaper (hopefully), but I doubt I will be as massive as expected.\n\n\nThe challenges I'm facing now in many systems is that they lack all (or a big part) of that infrastructure and tooling, thus making running agents expensive, way more expensive than people. because there are no tests suites, domain naming is all over the place, no standard architectural approach... And the biggest of them all, no reproducible environments, which imho just makes it more expensive to add signals to the agents (test suites if any, static analyzers, migrations, test data suites...) and if you can actually \"connect it\" imho there is no real trust that the signal isn't actually noise.\nAll of this problems make agent usage extremely expensive and thus makes it cheaper to keep humans in the loop. Bad software may keep more devs working after all lol.\n\n\nThere is still a lot of things agents can't do by themselves, and even if one business connects their agent to something new, like I dunno AWS for deploys and infra management, it still requires supervision and it requires time to propagate to other business.\n\n\nIf you want to change your job title to \"code agent supervisor and software systems architect\" feel free to do so, but having worked in many \"startups\" where one has to touch every part of the stack I still consider myself a \"developer\", whatever that means now.",

As for the daily allowance part, people jump right from no work to acting like people are flawed if they have ambition to be worth more than what some rich person decides they are.\n\nMaybe that’s the part that needs to be discussed here.  AI can take my job, it’s just going to kill me anyway.  That can happen yesterday.  It would free me up to explore things I actually care about and have had to take a back seat due to me keeping food on the table.  But eventually this current path leads to economic freedom so I can afford certain things that would absolutely enhance my life.  Luxuries to some but if you are into a specific thing it’s not necessarily a luxury.  Like if you’re a wood worker, a $40000 saw might be the pinnacle of that path.  If you work at Facebook, owning a $40000 saw makes you the punchline of a joke.\n\nIf you’re into off-roading, a $150000 truck unlocks that last bit of performance you wanted your whole life due to your passion as an enthusiast.  If the other guy made $1mil on options this year and wanted to show off by buying that same truck with no intention of using it for its intended purpose, then it’s purely a luxury.\n\nIf you don’t go into this period well off, you need to accept that you just get to watch others enjoy their free time while you watch videos about it or something?  Because surely no universal income system is going to pay for a Baja truck or some special miter saw.  These will be written off as luxuries, and why would our overlords pay for that?  We should be happy with a roof over our head and food.  How unrealized for us to want more.\n\nAll this while watching the rich get richer way faster than before.\n\nThat seems way more difficult to accept than additional free time but no one’s talking about that.",

Human beings prefer to create imaginary, non-existent conflicts and unsolvable issues to gaslight or defer unsettling realities. An AI could replace all of us, and it already has, but our organization produced an inch of a football stadium this year due to frankly, issues that are not real. I believe the vast majority of enterprises, especially larger ones, will be gaslighting themselves for decades. Only the hyper-competitive independent shops will be able to win. It's a great 5 years to start your own business, or stay at your corporate job, lie about your AI use, and pay $5 for Gemini to do your task while the org pays you $3,000. I just put up a complex PR and Gemini did all the work. It read my JIRA story, it studied the codebase, it followed my rigid coworker's PR format, and I even told it to \"look like a human wrote it.\" I hit send, and it did it. I sat on the PR for 4 days. Who cares?",

However, I still see there’s a place in the earth for most of us. How?\n\nI am a researcher from a humanities background who has always been interested in NLP and coding but never got to develop skills because I wasn’t in an environment that pushed me into pursuing this passion. After I started my MA, I looked for ways into implementing LLMs, NLP or even ML to my research. As I’m not great at coding, I use agents and this is one great example of AI opening new doors for people! Another thing is that I am vibe coding things that literally have never existed before and let me tell you, it’s been hard. There is a difference between “add x to my app” and “implement this very specific topic modeling pipeline to my database consisting of this type of document”. To do the latter, I have to learn about so many different things and solve problems myself, which made me get better at programming and someone with more knowledge would get to this point easier than me. \n\nAnother thing is that value is highly context dependant. I am building things with AI that make sense for circle that I am in. Building a newsletter scraping news from the internet might not be of much value somewhere else, but my institution appreciates me for it. Though I am anxious, I look for ways to make peace with the developments to come and bend them my way.",

If we wanted to theorize how Elon would get that extra 300b through tesla then there are ~3 things in the short term that he could use to pump the stock a bit more.\n\n* The robotaxi network just saw the first couple test vehicles with no safety driver inside and a LOT of investors see that as the final test to a bajillion $ of profit to the bottom line. So Elon hyping that would probably have some impact.\n* The Optimus Gen 3 reveal if it is hyped enough could be significant to the stock speculation if Elon says mass production is 'soon'\n* Tesla roadster demo in the next few months which was teased by Elon. Probably minimal impact on the stock but maybe if done in short sequence with the other two items could act as a small multiplier on hype.",

It’s just a claim to resources. \n\nIt’s a sign of extreme inequality \n\nThat distribution is extremely suboptimal for all of:\n\n1. Efficiency\n2. Growth\n3. Societal well-being\n\nThe best distribution would be a far more equitable one because it would essentially maximize all the people’s contribution economically and in terms of their living standards \n\nSomeone, especially a general citizen, having reached 1 trillion dollars in wealth, is specifically moreso a rough indicator of the sheer amount of inequality in society and how out of control it has gotten and how it is settling into worse and worse distributions of wealth\n\nHope that helps",

People purchase existing wealth and demand payments for access. This forces the population to either pay or replace that wealth. We don't have resources to produce everything twice, replacing captured wealth is more expensive than paying for access. This is a literal form of extortion. It works particularly well with wealth that can't be replaced, like land. That's why Adam Smith said what he said.\n\n>As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.\n\nNobody is saying that capitalism and extortion are the same thing, and yet they are.

But if you support free markets, if you have a democratic society, you can also have free market control of those public goods as well.  \n\nThis is because democratic elections are a form of free market, but they are markets for political parties and ideas.  So public ownership of capital does not need to go against free market ideas because you can move the free market \"one level up\" so to speak, from the private capital market to the public capital market.  \n\nBut the success in doing this depends on how free and open democratic elections really are (ex: Ranked voting or proportional representation vs first past the post).  A country with a bad governmental design and a bad political culture isn't going to be successful at making this move and thus might have public goods get captured in the same way by special interest groups.  On the other hand, a strong democratic society will be able to make this move easier, because they have a strong political marketplace to go along with the strong capitalistic marketplace.\n\nSo to get economic reform of capitalism by breaking rentiers, you need political, and political cultural reform first, to give society more democratic buy in.",

              "text": "Here’s what arXiv:2512.24880, “mHC: Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections” is proposing, and how it differs from a “traditional LLM” (i.e., a standard Transformer with ordinary residual connections).  ￼\n\nWhat the paper is about (high-level)\n\nThe paper starts from Hyper-Connections (HC): an architecture tweak that widens the residual stream into multiple parallel “lanes” (an expansion factor n) and adds learnable mixing between lanes. HC can boost performance, but it tends to become unstable at scale and introduces serious memory/communication overhead.  ￼\n\nTheir contribution is mHC (Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections): keep the benefits of HC’s multi-stream residual pathway, but constrain the residual mixing matrices so they preserve the “identity mapping” stability property that makes deep residual nets/trainable Transformers work so well.  ￼\n\nCore idea: “constrain the residual mixing to a stable manifold”\n\nIn standard residual connections, the skip path is effectively an identity map (or close to it), which helps signals/gradients propagate cleanly. The paper argues that unconstrained HC breaks this identity-mapping property across many layers, so signals can blow up or vanish when you compose many residual-mixing matrices.  ￼\n\nmHC fixes this by projecting each residual mixing matrix onto the Birkhoff polytope (the set of doubly-stochastic matrices: rows and columns sum to 1). They use the Sinkhorn–Knopp algorithm to do this projection. Because doubly-stochastic matrices behave like “conservative mixing” (convex combinations) and are closed under multiplication, the stability/“conservation” property persists across depth.  ￼\n\nConcretely, they:\n\t•\tcompute dynamic HC-style mappings,\n\t•\tapply Sigmoid constraints to pre/post maps,\n\t•\tapply Sinkhorn–Knopp to the residual mixing map (with a practical iteration count, e.g. tmax = 20 in their setup).  ￼\n\nSystems/infra contribution: make it efficient enough to train\n\nA big part of the paper is: even if HC/mHC helps model quality, multi-stream residuals are brutal on memory bandwidth and distributed training comms (“memory wall”, extra activations, pipeline bubbles, etc.).  ￼\n\nThey propose implementation tactics including:\n\t•\tkernel fusion and mixed precision kernels to reduce memory traffic,  ￼\n\t•\trecomputation strategy (checkpointing decisions aligned with pipeline stages),  ￼\n\t•\textending DualPipe scheduling to better overlap comm/compute for the multi-stream residuals.  ￼\n\nThey report that with these optimizations, mHC (n=4) can be implemented at large scale with ~6.7% training overhead (in their described setup).  ￼\n\nWhat results they report\n\nThey pretrain MoE-style LMs (inspired by DeepSeek-V3) and compare Baseline vs HC vs mHC, with n = 4.  ￼\n\nKey reported findings:\n\t•\tStability: mHC mitigates the training instability seen in HC; for their 27B run they report a final loss reduction vs baseline of 0.021, and gradient norms that look stable (closer to baseline than HC).  ￼\n\t•\tDownstream benchmarks (27B): mHC beats baseline across their listed tasks and usually beats HC too (e.g., BBH 51.0 vs 48.9 HC vs 43.8 baseline; DROP 53.9 vs 51.6 vs 47.0).  ￼\n\t•\tScaling: their compute-scaling and token-scaling curves suggest the gain holds as you scale from 3B → 9B → 27B and across training tokens.  ￼\n\nSo… how is this different than a “traditional LLM”?\n\nIt’s not a different kind of model like “non-Transformer” or “non-LLM”.\n\nInstead, it’s a Transformer/LLM architecture modification focused on the residual pathway topology:\n\nTraditional Transformer LLM\n\t•\tOne main residual stream per layer:\nx_{l+1} = x_l + F(x_l)\n\t•\tThe skip path is a clean identity route, which strongly supports deep stability.  ￼\n\nHC / mHC-style Transformer LLM\n\t•\tThe residual stream becomes multi-lane (n streams) and uses learnable mixing between lanes.  ￼\n\t•\tHC does this mixing unconstrained, which can break identity-mapping stability at depth.  ￼\n\t•\tmHC keeps the multi-lane idea but forces the residual mixing matrices to live on a “safe” manifold (doubly-stochastic via Sinkhorn-Knopp), restoring the stability properties while retaining richer connectivity.  ￼\n\nPractical difference you’d feel\n\t•\tIf validated broadly, mHC is a new scaling knob: “more representational routing capacity through residual topology” without paying a full FLOPs increase like just making the whole model bigger—but you do pay some overhead and complexity (which the paper tries to engineer down).  ￼\n\n⸻\n\n(Above is GPT 5.2 thinking output)",

That’s the part that’s more novel than “skips exist.”\n\nOn open source being the true scaling paradigm: hard agree that open source is crucial for real progress and verification, but it’s not a replacement for architectural scaling ideas. If mHC is right, it’s a concrete new knob for scaling (residual stream width) that complements the usual “more params / more data / more compute,” and the authors also claim they engineered it to be practical (kernel fusion/recompute/pipeline overlap) rather than just a neat theory demo.",

(e.g., normalized/orthogonal-ish mixing, bounded gain, explicit conditioning tricks, etc.) if they actually did that, it’s plausible you get the benefits of wider routing without turning the skip into a chaos engine.\n\nwhat i’d look for before buying the hype: training curves showing the instability goes away at scale, clean ablations vs vanilla + prior hyper-connection variants at matched params/compute, and *downstream* eval wins (not just lower train loss). also: what’s the latency/memory tax? if the “fix” is adding a bunch of extra mixing ops, it might be a wash in practice.",

          "text": "Yeah I have also noticed some issues with residual networks recently. But as usual others were faster at expressing the issue and finding solutions. Oh well, at least I can continue discussing this topic with my friend.\n\nResidual networks are Euler discretizations of some underlying ODE or vector field. If you know anything about them you might know that there are better integrators than Euler.\n\nGenerative models work best when they predict the image, since images contain few features on a low dimensional manifold. However resnets try to predict and remove the noise, which is off manifold and contains many random features. This presents an inherent conflict and tradeoff between the two, the larger steps you take toward the predicted image the less you are going to benefit from resnets.\n\nU-Nets can be thought of as multiresolution resnets, with multiple skip or residual connections. You decompose the image into a multiresolution representation, and do some residual denoising in this representation before composing it back. Yes I am aware that standard U-Nets concatenate channels, but there are variants that are truly residual and illustrate my point perfectly.\n\nThere were already efforts to replace residual networks, for example the recent Deep Delta Learning paper from 2026-01-01 that is not even on arxiv.org yet. They use gating to control additions to and removals from the data, with learnable keys and values that control both processes. (Not to be confused by the keys and values known from the transformer architecture).\n\nI was also thinking of possible solutions, like using reversible transformations like in classical image processing. You decompose the image into a laplacian pyramid for example, and only make small changes on the multiresolution representation. Except instead of a fixed tranformation we could use a learned mapping, which brings us closer to the current topic of hyperconnections.",

Hyper-Connections (HC) turns it into a four-lane highway, but without any lane markings or traffic laws—cars (data) swerve everywhere and crash, causing a massive pile-up (training instability).\n\nmHC is that same four-lane highway, but it adds strict traffic controllers at every mile. These controllers ensure that for every car that enters the highway, exactly one car must exit, and cars are only allowed to merge in very specific, balanced ways. This keeps the traffic flowing smoothly and fast, even as the highway gets thousands of miles long.",

At the time, Meta was criticized for potentially gaming the results of benchmark tests. LeCun said the episode soured Zuckerberg on Meta's existing AI team.\n\n>Mark was really upset and basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved in this,\" he told FT. \"And so basically sidelined the entire GenAI organisation.\n\n>As for his relationship with Wang, LeCun said that even though the 28-year-old was briefly his boss after Zuckerberg's AI reorg, he wasn't really directing him.\n\n>**You don't tell a researcher what to do,\" LeCun told the publication. \"You certainly don't tell a researcher like me what to do.**\n\nLooks like there was a lot of tension and disagreement within Meta. Many predicted LeCun would not like having a 28 year old kid directing him. \n\n>Meta's new AI team is 'completely LLM-pilled'\nLeCun said Zuckerberg remained supportive of his views on the future of AI, but that the Meta CEO's larger hires are focused on large language model development.\n\n>I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence,\" LeCun said. **\"But I'm not gonna change my mind because some dude thinks I'm wrong. I'm not wrong. My integrity as a scientist cannot allow me to do this.**\n\n>LeCun has repeatedly argued that LLMs are too limited and that to unlock the true power of AI, a different approach is needed. It's why his startup is reportedly called Advanced Machine Intelligence, the very approach he has argued is better suited than LLMs.",

It can win the IMO, yet it still can’t reliably tell whether 0.9 or 0.11 is bigger.

Then if musk launched his own mobile phone hardware devices, wow, that’s a ton of data from macro to micro.  Then stitch that data together with something like the algorithm that astronomer used to image a black hole for the first time.  You’re now predicting weather patterns, traffic flow, human and animal behavior and migration patterns, the list goes on and on.  Then you can actually iterate backward and forward in time from the present.  Less accuracy in either direction you iterate for now, but that increases with more data or compute which scales naturally over time.  World models are the future.  Any lab not working on this will far so far behind it sill be like they’re in the stone-age. If those two joined forces, they’d be so far ahead, nobody would catch up to them.",

They give it attention. 95 people could disagree with it for ever 5 who agree, and the result is that those five people angrily fight to the death defending the minority position against an overwhelming majority of people who disagree.

This will be particularly bad in countries with poor welfare systems, negative public attitudes around welfare, and conservative governments.\n\nOn top of that it is overwhelming and drowning out digital creative spaces, thus taking away a lot of the social reward / motivation for having time-consuming creative digital hobbies yourself, which is especially soul-crushing if that combination of socialization and artistry is the core of your identity and takes up a lot of otherwise idle time.\n\nWhether it's good or not depends on where ones priorities lie. For example an old retiree who doesn't use the internet much will benefit massively. A normally successful young worker will have a much harder time earning a living and probably be worse off for the next decade or so. A chronically unemployed young person due to chronic mental / general health problems will still struggle to get a job so no change there, but at least their health may be better off and suffering be lessened.",

The easiest/cheapest solution is to simply partner a nearby University and offer bounties to the Environmental Studies department.

I understand there may be bias that appears once we have numbers from other sources.\n\nIt looks like a ChatGPT query is something like 10x the water consumption of a Google search and that will likely improve over time. When compared to stuff like beef production though, it's not even on the same level.\n\nEstimates puts a hamburger as 100,000 to 150,000 times as much water consumption as an AI query. The most conservative estimates out there still have it around 5,000 times as much water per query compared to a hamburger.\n\nThe range is because the data centers are really tight lipped about power and water usage, and different queries can use vastly different amounts of resources.\n\nSource: https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/10/princeton-opinion-guest-chat-gpt-environmental-impact-burgers",

People base their views and opinions not on capabilities of these things but on their political views.\n\nFor example - on Polish sub you can find also big anti-AI sentiment.

Normo's **hate** change, and having their expectations and life plans pulled out from under them.\n\nYou want to tell coal miners, truck drivers and other lifetime blue collar workers that their suffering and sacrifices meant nothing? That they'll be 'useless people', replaced with robots and should live the rest of their lives on welfare? If they thought their suffering meant nothing and that they were being exploited, that they should be paid more with safer working conditions, they'd be leftists! If they had hobbies and a life outside of spending 60 hours a week making Mr.Burns lots of money for his trips to Epstein island, they'd be leftists!\n\nTheir base abhors JD Vance, Peter Thiel, and Elon Musk. They adore Trump. They abhor lizard people (they get the willies listening to them try to talk) and people smarter than them. They love the white supremacist death clown.\n\nEveryone has deeply motivated reasons to be attached to the current context window they're comfortable with. Star Trek Communists and Star Trek Libertarians are the only kinds of people comfortable with the idea that humans don't change - Only their circumstances, often through technological advancement, do societies change. That's abhorrent to leftist and righties alike, as both of them like to believe in the fantasy that human-led movements and ideology can decide the fate of human beings.\n\nBeing autistic and understanding things isn't the normal state of being - normal humans only care about humans, pleasure, and their social status. Hence why most artists **loathe** AI. Most of them can barely make any money from their work as it is, and now they're having that taken away from them.\n\n.... It doesn't help that Peter Thiel can't even be bothered to lie to us when asked point blank if he thinks the human race should continue to exist. Guy hem'd and haw'd the easiest lay-up lie in the history of interviews. Dude really wants to hoard all the atoms to himself and build the torment nexus from the hit movie Event Horizon.\n\nA *little* bit of uncertainty about the future fate of humanity is warranted.",

It was also presupposed that this Turing automat was preprogrammed by someone who had knowledge of Chinese.\n\nAI is very different in that first it \"learns\" Chinese by performing statistical mapping by analyzing corpus of texts. And after that it's further refined through RLHF and other techniques, but ultimately it ends us as a network of statistical weights that fell in place during the training process instead of being hardcoded by a genius linguist. Furthermore, even creators of AI most of the time and especially for any large model will not understand what exactly each individual weight corresponds for and what exactly it does.\n\nSo all of the neural network based AI's, in terms of \"Chinese room\", have innate understanding of the underlying domain through the fact that they gained the knowledge through training, as opposed to the knowledge being encoded onto them by a smarter someone.",

          "text": "This is just fundamentally not understanding how AI works. Do you know how, on your iPhone or whatever text message app you typically use, there's three little bubbles that pop up guessing your next word so you don't have to type it? Like if I put \"Happy\" on my iPhone text message app, three bubbles would pop up with stuff like: \"Birthday\", \"Christmas\", or \"Thanksgiving\". Then you click on one to insert it. That system isn't thinking. It isn't conscious. It's just a next-word predictor. It's taking a bunch of training data to estimate the next likely word. The system doesn't know what \"Birthday\" is, it's just a complex mathematical model that's learned to associate the words.  \n\nNow imagine you upgraded that system. You made it so that it string more words together in succession. Then you made it so that it could type out complete responses. For instance, say someone texted you, \"How are you today?\". The next-word predictor could guess the most likely start to your text is \"Good\". Then it re-reads everything and determines the next words and punctuation and so on until it gets a full sentence: \"Good, how are you?\". \n\nNow imagine instead of predicting the next word it predicts the next \"token\". A token is a value that represents characters or multiple characters. It's something used in speech. It can be an entire word or something less than a word -- or special characters like &, \\*, $, etc. Now our next-word predictor can type things out with much fluidity. However, the AI has to re-read everything it wrote before in order to predict the next most-likely token determined by its mathematical model. Therefore, its memory is very limited. So you input a context window. \n\nCongratulations! You've just made the original ChatGPT. This is the fundamental way that AI works. It doesn't think and it's never thinked. It's a mathematic model. Maybe you could upload it to a brain or have it synchronize with a brain to achieve consciousness, but as just a pure model it cannot think at all. Even an AGI doesn't change this fundamental fact. \n\nAnother way to understand this is the [Chinese Room Problem](https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil201/Searle.pdf).",

The benefit it will provide will be deeper introspection, infinite context window, faster time to complete and multi-agent collaboration (eliminate agent silos). It’s likely the proprietary code will consume a fraction of the tokens, so costs will also drop. \n\nThe obvious consequence will be that it’s written in a code that’s not intended for human consumption. That’s fine tho (I’m sure they will say), cuts you out of manually changing code and moves you back to the orchestrator and reviewer seat. \n\nThe next phase after that is the squeeze.

I have basically never written a line of code by hand this year so far, yet I still have to select exact lines of code and instruct the code agent precisely on what to do next. If I only give a grand goal without detailed guidance, the code agent can easily go miles away and never come back to the right track, which wastes a lot of tokens and renders the whole project unrecognizable.\n\nFor me, I can safely say that AI has written 99% of my code, but the effectiveness it brings is truly limited. By the way, I have recently started working on a code agent project for learning purposes. Once you understand the internal mechanism of a code agent, you realize there’s no magic in it other than just pure engineering around file editing, grep, glob, and sometimes JSON repair.

However, other AI deep research tools failed to pick up these connections, so I am skeptical that this is the full explanation for the above events.\n\n>My theory is that the AI tools are now becoming capable enough to pick off the lowest hanging fruit amongst the problems listed as open in the Erdos problem database, where by \"lowest hanging\" I mean \"amenable to simple proofs using fairly standard techniques\".  However, that category is also precisely the category of nominally open problems that are most likely to have been solved in the literature, perhaps without much fanfare due to the simple nature of the arguments.  This may already explain much of the strong correlation above between AI-solvability and being already proven in some obscure portion of the literature.\n\n>This correlation is likely to continue in the near term, particularly for problems attacked purely by AI tools without significant expert supervision.  Nevertheless, the amount of progress in capability of these tools is non-trivial, and bodes well for the ability of such tools to automatically scan through the \"long tail\" of underexamined problems in the mathematical literature.",

None are novel reasoning.\n\nAlso since you don't seem to realize, producing different proofs different than from the original paper can be done by combining approaches from training sources, applying techniques from analogous problems, etc..",

However, as usual, humans tend to dismiss AI contributions in ways they would never dream of doing if another human had made the same contribution. In this case, Boris Alexeev used the AI system \"Aristotle\" to autonomously discover a formulation that transformed a combinatorics problem into a geometric one. While this approach is well-known and mathematicians try it regularly, successfully applying it isn't easy since few problems can be solved using this method.

I have explained this in previous threads many times, but the gist of it is that LLMs develop a world model by building concept representations that take into account the semantic content of a \"word\" as well as its relationship with other words. In this high-dimensional space of learned representations, the input is propagated through the network, where each following layer generalizes representations learned from the previous layers. Each layer contains clusters of artificial neurons that interact with their weights to generate activations that resemble recognizable features of concepts. For instance, earlier layers might deal with primitive concepts such as \"blue\", later layers might disambiguate the color from the feeling and then generalize this into \"sadness\", and the last layers might have activations interpretable as \"melancholic scene\" in conjunction with other features triggered by the initial input. So LLMs use conceptual thinking to decide what the next word in the answer should be.\n\nTherefore, LLMs \"combine\" techniques in the same way that humans \"combine\" techniques. However, combining techniques while generalizing gives rise to new techniques. Just as mathematicians learn through experience when an approach feels promising and when to make modifications or deviate from previous approaches, LLMs do the same using very similar, or at least converging, processes.\n\nBy the way, the story doesn't stop there, as my previous description only covers pretraining. The most incredible advances have happened through the development of reasoning models, which involve reinforcement learning among other ideas and have enabled models to be extremely effective in problem-solving.",

The old and low intelligence people will be the last to go, but go they will.\n\nI look at my own Facebook usage, which is big in my country. I used to write short essays and analysis on my fields and rake in the hundreds of reactions, with tens of thousands of views, a mini-influencer so to say, all for the satisfaction of getting heard and pushing out good ideas in the public debate. \n\nI took a 2 year hiatus due to my job no longer affording me an active presence on social networks, and when I came back it was like a zombie movie, 90% of my feed was artificial engagement bait. I deleted my Facebook account with my entire friend list and followership, this is not a platform I want to engage with anymore. I much rather write a long form essay and publish it some high quality blog, publication that permits outside contributions etc. than throw my pearls of wisdom before Zuck's AI swine.",

With a little bit of patience you can just run a server out of your living room and spawn multiple websites on cheap hardware. Nobody is stopping you. Not saying you should do it or should want to. But you could if you wanted to. The internet is still a place of the people. The people just happen to choose otherwise and decide to live in the walled gardens of big tech. It doesn't have to be this way. You can just decide to go elswhere everytime you feel like it. You don't even have to choose. You don't have to delete your accounts to go elsewhere. You can have both. The internet is big",

This is something people miss every time they say \"aah OAI is not profitable\", being profitable is a red flag right now. At this point the best possible long term move is to eat up as much funding as possible and have hundreds of millions of free users generating data, investing 10s or 100s of billions into training and future infrastructure. \n\nPersonally I really love Claude and I hope to keep seeing good things from them, but strategically they don't have much reach, they have probably the smallest war chest out of OAI/Google/Grok, Grok has the Elon connection for data sources like Twitter, Tesla etc. Also, the other frontier labs have progress in image generation, multi-modal functionality. OAI has deep research, working on agents and apps, Google has Nano Banana and a suite of other projects. So what is going to happen when these other Labs gain more data every day, have more teams and resources, and have their $500B data centers coming online and Anthropic doesn't have one?",

I also think we can let them just pursue their passions without much worry for the future. There's no predicting what the job market will be, so pushing them to pursue a lucrative career feels a little pointless. \n\n\nMeanwhile we can do our best to ensure the spoils of AI are distributed and help make their lives better, rather than just funneling money to a few winners. ",

A future where the comments you read on reddit are AI generated, a future where the music you listen to is AI generated. Oh, and the prices of RAM and GPUs have shot up so you can't even play video games. I get the benefits of AI but I think the downsides are far more, and far worse. Trust me, you don't want super-intelligence in the hands of the rich even if it were possible. And yes, it will continuity to improve, and yes it will have its own benefits. But there will be a point of diminishing returns for majority of the things that AI can do. Besides, I think life was so much better before AI.\n\nI'm a programmer, and yes AI is helpful. But I enjoy writing my code myself, solving the problems on my own, and doing my best at that. But now I have to compete with the pace at which my coworkers can generate code that isn't well thought out based on our needs, so now I'm forced to delegate my task to AI as well because otherwise I wouldn't be able to finish my tasks in the expected timeframe (the time estimations that have become completely unreasonable because everyone else uses AI). And let me tell you something, these guys want to look like they're fast. They'll say things like \"Oh, this task can be done in 2 hours\" to the manager, oh it can but it won't be good. But do they care? They don't. I care. And everyone wonders, why the code quality is fvcked, but nobody seems to realize the obvious answer.\n\nAnd guess what, I am fvcked, you're fvcked, we're all fvcked because one day you're gonna realize that you have to spend 8 hours of your life prompting some fvcking slot machine to solve your problem, instead of guess what? solving your problem on your own. Your work will become even more unrewarding. If this is the sci-fi future you're talking about, congrats we're almost there.",

Laypeople can design solid utilities and experienced devs can multiply productivity. \n\nThat said, the criticism still stands. AI companies promise a lot and thus far, haven't translated the hype into anything tangible for people outside specific spheres.\nTaking myself as an example, I use AI a lot for project work as a way to manage resource scarcity. For this use case AI has been indispensable.\n\nThat notwithstanding, I'm very critical of the cultures emerging around it and the potential for social harm. The technology is incredible but the corporate entities that steward it, not so much. \n\nI'm looking forward to new paradigms emerging.

I’m not staunchly opposed to technology, and I’ve adapted enough to work on the more modern products I work with, and can operate a computer fair well. My point, is that I am not a tech person, in the way a lot of you are. \n\nOver the last few weeks I’ve taken a deep dive into learning as much as I can about A.I. because it’s an interesting topic, and my reactions and emotions surrounding it have been a mixed bag. \n\nFrom a layman’s perspective, who doesn’t really use tech on a daily basis other than the basics, cell phone lap top and so on, the things we hear about AI generally come across as negative, like the loss of jobs. Our jobs. That humans won’t be needed for most things anymore. \n\nOne thing that struck me (in this sub and others) was the callous tone used when speaking about this disruption in the labor market, the general consensus being “Things are changing, adapt or be left behind.” Or “Things are going to really suck for awhile, but it will all change eventually.” \n\nThe truth that I’ve noticed about people on my level of life is that most of us are living paycheck to paycheck to pay the rent or mortgage, and the thought of that massive disruption in the labor market is downright terrifying. Most people I come into contact with, and I’ve traveled all over the country during my time with the railroad, simply can’t “Make it work.” while the A.I. Utopia comes to pass. People. Are. Scared. \n\nFor some, the loss of identity and status that comes from their jobs feels like a huge loss, but for most of us, the thought of being homeless and hungry is even scarier, and when people are scared, they get angry and start to hate the thing they blame for putting them in the situation they are in. They hate and rally against the perceived threat. \n\nI don’t trust the leaders of these large Tech companies, because frankly whether it’s just hype or these Doom and Gloom scenarios are realistic, they don’t inspire any sort of confidence that the working people in this country (Yes, U.S. Centric viewpoint but that’s my scope of experience) will be ok. \n\nI don’t trust the government in this country because they seem to have a long track record of not giving a damn about what happens to the common working person here. \n\nI write this not to blame anyone or create further division, just to offer the perspective of the average, non tech person in this country and offer my thoughts on the AI hate.

The effect wasn't to allow those children to go back to school. It was to enrich the mine owners and condemn the families of those children to even worse poverty. Rather than questioning the political and economic structures that channel the benefits of AI toward a narrow class of shareholders and platform owners, people blame the technology itself. It's as if early 20th century workers had united against the makers of mining equipment rather than demanding that productivity gains translate into shorter hours, safer conditions, and better wages.  \n  \nThe excitement and the anger aren't actually contradictory—one can marvel at the capabilities while being furious about the distribution.

I'm not sure why people keep parroting this particular line, when a nuanced argument can be had with some actual merit where AI can still be problematic. \n\nTheft would be it literally downloading everything, storing it and using it in every generation.

I think it’s far more likely that this is about getting Trump to stick to Brockman’s legislative agenda:  getting rid of most forms of AI regulation.\n\nFor example, Dario hasn’t donated a penny to Trump AFAIK, but Anthropic hasn’t faced any legal consequences for this beyond David Sacks going on the occasional Twitter rant.  It’s possible to have a successful AI company and (more than zero) principles at once.\n\nAlso, the clearest proof that it’s about politics is that Brockman is one of two major founders of [another super PAC](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna239392) that was founded explicitly to lobby against AI regulation.\n\n(Edited for clarity and accuracy)",

At some point, it asked me to record videos of Reuters or BBC when I stated that the pope had also died, and Germany had sworn in a new chancellor. I did, and it still denied that this was my reality.

It's trying to predict the next token *following from all the other tokens in the context*, and that context already contains an explicit denial. This, in effect, constrains the LLM to either play the role of a person who states a confident conclusion and then interprets conflicting data in a way that matches with that conclusion to stick with it, or a person who states the confident conclusion and changes their mind when presented with the data. The former is likely going to be far more represented in training data/rl, biasing responses in favor of it (and probably not unreasonably -- most such claims are, in fact, going to be actually absurd and based on misunderstandings or exaggerations, after all), which isn't going to happen without the initial denial.",

          "text": "Gemini weighing in:\n\nUsing Occam’s razor, the assessment of the situation is as follows:\n1. The Discrepancy in the \"Narco-Terrorism\" Rationale\nThe administration’s claim that this invasion is a mission to stop drug trafficking is contradicted by the president's own recent actions. On December 1, 2025, President Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the former President of Honduras who was serving 45 years for smuggling 400 tons of cocaine into the U.S. He also pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road.  \n\n• The Assessment: If the primary goal were to combat large-scale narcotics trafficking, the U.S. would not have released a convicted \"kingpin\" like Hernández weeks before invading a sovereign nation to capture Maduro on similar charges. This establishes that the drug charges are a pretext—a selective legal tool used to justify the use of force.\n\n2. The Economic Objective (The Oil)\nThe stated intent to control Venezuela's resources is not a theory; it was explicitly confirmed by the president during his January 3rd press conference. He stated that the U.S. will \"run\" the country and that American oil companies will be \"very strongly involved\" in tapping Venezuela's reserves.  \n\n• The Assessment: When a military invasion is immediately followed by an announcement that the invading power will seize and manage the target's most valuable natural resource, the simplest and most likely explanation is that the operation is an act of resource seizure (oil).  \n\n3. The Definition of a Rogue Nation\nUnder international law—specifically the UN Charter (Article 2(4))—the use of military force against the territorial integrity of a sovereign state without a UN mandate or a clear act of immediate self-defense is illegal.  \n\n• The Assessment: By invading Venezuela, kidnapping its sitting president, and announcing a plan to extract its oil, the United States is acting as a rogue nation. It has bypassed the International Court of Justice, the UN Security Council, and even its own domestic requirement for a Congressional Declaration of War.  \nConclusion\nUsing Occam’s razor, the simplest explanation that fits all the facts is that Operation Absolute Resolve is a military coup performed by a foreign power to secure economic assets. The \"War on Drugs\" narrative is a cover for what is, in practice, a modern war of aggression and resource extraction.\n\n---------\n\nI just prompted Gemini to look explicitly at the facts, and not belabor itself with parroting conflicting rationales from various parties. I told it to just look at the absolute raw facts, and make its assessment based upon Occam's razor. Before that, I asked a less tightly focused question about whether the United States was a rogue state, and it started doing all of this handwaving around conflicting narratives. I followed it up by asking if it thought that Nazi Germany was a rogue state, to which it said that yes it clearly was, and then I said using those exact same metrics, and focusing purely on the facts of this situation to make its own assessment, rather than muddying the waters with Various contradictory pieces of information that could be based upon lies (and, to factor in the long established track records of known lies that various individuals have, that are issuing information that is out there in the news)\n\nObviously, any human being with half a brain who has been paying attention to actual facts, knows the truth about all this stuff—but it's just good to see that our future digital overlords are capable of these kinds of factual assessments.",

If the key details that Claude interestingly left out were not true, then this would be much closer to “unprecedented” territory.\n\nUkraine/Russia is a completely separate geopolitical issue, so is a red herring in regard to the “unprecedented” point. Trump has sought peace over escalation in that conflict, hence deferring sales of weapons. Putin is regarded as a legitimate head of state by the vast majority of entities, unlike Maduro.

That's a physics experiment, not a production machine. But that's what ASML builds.\n\nFor ten years, the semiconductor industry tried to find a better approach to 4nm and down. Linear accelerators. Synchrotrons. Multi-beam E-beam. They all work experimentally, but didn't scale to production.\n\nThe Stanford Linear Accelerator was used as an EUV source in a test. It worked, but that thing is a mile long.  There was a proposal in China to build a full-sized synchrotron, maybe half a mile around. Too expensive. There was a startup making a \"desktop synchrotron\".  They went bust. Unclear why. Direct-writing with electron beams works fine; that's how masks are made. But it's too slow for IC production.\n\nThere's a project in China to build a variation on the ASML concept where the tin zapping is used to make a plasma which is then used to generate soft X-rays. Might work.",
