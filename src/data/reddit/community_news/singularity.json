Resveratrol was found to increase NAD+ levels.\n\nThe controversy isnt really about resveratrol, pterostilbene or other analogues, or even NAD+ precursors like NMN and NMR not working. \n\nThe general zeitgeist is that David Sinclair is a scammer because of the benefits that *should* result from NAD+ supplementation if the benefit he purports exists exists, and that the results have unfortunately been the opposite of what's claimed, with actual *harm* done from these supplements. \n\nThe reality is it it's option 3, he's not lying but NAD+ apparently has to be synthesized in the correct way inside the body for it to not be toxic. The current exogenous (outside the body) stimulation via supplementation still uses precursors which target the wrong receptors. Resveratrol, Petrostilbene, etc, they conceptually should work but in practice are harmful because of the way they are processed inside the body.\n\nSinclair's assertions were stretched massively and basically coopted by grifters.\n\nThat's what I found doing a lot of research into NAD+ anyways. I have a lot of medical issues and NAD+ came up everywhere so I did a deep dive into it.",

          "text": "**What Should We Do for Health and Longevity?**\n\nGiven that science suggests while NAD+ is excellent for youthfulness, synthetic supplements may be risky or ineffective, the primary strategy is to boost **endogenous** (natural) NAD+ production within the body.\n\nThe following practices achieve exactly what supplements are theoretically designed to do, but without any side effects:\n\n**1. Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction**  \nControlled hunger (such as the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours) places a \"mild stress\" on the body. This naturally activates survival genes (sirtuins) and significantly elevates NAD+ levels.\n\n**2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**  \nExercises that spike your heart rate and leave you breathless (such as sprinting, fast cycling, or CrossFit) are the best stimulants for natural NAD+ production and mitochondrial biogenesis (the multiplication of the cells' energy-producing powerhouses).\n\n**3. Cold and Heat Exposure (Hormesis)**  \nUsing dry saunas (extreme heat) and ice baths or cold showers (extreme cold) provides \"beneficial shocks\" to the body. These triggers stimulate the natural production of heat shock proteins and increase NAD+ levels.\n\n**4. A Polyphenol-Rich Diet Instead of Supplements**  \nInstead of taking Resveratrol pills (which often contain doses thousands of times higher than natural levels and can be harmful), rely on natural sources. Consuming blueberries, red grapes, strawberries, dark chocolate (above 85%), and green tea introduces natural precursors into the body at the right pace and in a way that is compatible with the digestive system.\n\n**5. Regulating the Circadian Rhythm (Deep Sleep)**  \nThe enzyme in the body that produces NAD+ (NAMPT) is highly dependent on your circadian rhythm. If you stay up late or expose your eyes to phone light at night, the NAD+ production cycle is disrupted. Sleeping in total darkness, ideally between 10 PM and 6 AM, is vital for the production of this essential molecule.",

In adult human skin fibroblasts, 100 μM psilocin increased lifespan by 51%, with similar reductions in senescence and oxidative damage.\n\nIn vivo, aged female mice (19 months old, roughly equivalent to 60–65 human years) received monthly oral psilocybin doses (initial 5 mg/kg, then 15 mg/kg for 9 additional months). Over the 10-month treatment period, treated mice achieved an 80% survival rate versus 50% in vehicle controls, with fewer outward signs of decline (e.g., less fur graying and better coat quality). These effects suggest psilocybin acts as a potent geroprotective agent, influencing multiple hallmarks of aging beyond its known psychiatric benefits.\n\nThe authors emphasize these are early, preclinical findings (in vitro cells and mice only), warranting further research before any human longevity applications.\"\n\n[Kato, K., Kleinhenz, J.

          "text": "I asked claude about possible negative effects of this:\n\nSeveral plausible backfire effects:\n\n**Accelerates Anthropic's marginalization.** If the boycott narrative becomes \"cancel ChatGPT, switch to Claude,\" it directly reinforces the Trump administration's framing that Anthropic is the ideological opposition. Trump already called Anthropic \"Leftwing nut jobs\" trying to \"STRONG-ARM the Department of War.\" [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/27/nx-s1-5729118/trump-anthropic-pentagon-openai-ai-weapons-ban) A visible consumer migration from OpenAI to Anthropic on political grounds makes it easier to paint Anthropic as a partisan actor rather than a safety-focused one, which weakens its legal and public case. It also gives the administration more ammunition to extend punitive measures — the supply chain risk designation becomes easier to justify politically if Anthropic's user base is visibly coded as anti-administration.\n\n**Validates the \"safety = obstruction\" framing.** The boycott merges multiple grievances: Brockman's political donations, ICE contracts, the Pentagon deal, ads, the for-profit conversion. That breadth is strategically useful for organizers but conceptually messy. It conflates AI safety concerns (autonomous weapons, surveillance) with partisan opposition to Trump. The more the boycott succeeds as a left-coded political action, the more it entrenches the idea that AI safety itself is a partisan position. That's catastrophic for long-term safety policy, which needs bipartisan support or at minimum bipartisan indifference to pass.\n\n**Weakens the \"all AI companies agree\" leverage.** Altman publicly stated he shares Anthropic's red lines and told CNBC it's important to comply with \"legal protections\" and \"the few red lines\" that OpenAI and others in the industry share. [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/27/tech/openai-has-same-redlines-as-anthropic-in-any-deal-with-the-pentagon) That industry consensus was one of Anthropic's strongest cards — \"we're not unusual, every serious lab agrees on these limits.\" If the boycott successfully damages OpenAI and makes military contracts politically toxic for them, OpenAI's incentive to maintain even rhetorical alignment with Anthropic on safety principles evaporates. They'll lean harder into the government relationship to differentiate. You lose the unified industry front.\n\n**Creates a permission structure for worse actors.** If OpenAI loses meaningful consumer revenue, it becomes more dependent on government and enterprise contracts, not less. The revenue mix shifts toward exactly the customers who want fewer restrictions. Same logic applies industry-wide: if consumer sentiment makes the commercial AI market hostile to companies with military ties, the companies that serve the military will increasingly optimize for the military as their primary customer. You get more captured vendors, not more principled ones.\n\n**The midterm effect could cut both ways.** There's already a $125 million super PAC targeting the legislator who authored the first major AI safety law. [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/28/ai-selloff-politics-agents.html) A highly visible, left-coded boycott gives that PAC better material. \"Liberal activists are trying to defund our military's AI capabilities\" is a straightforward attack ad. The boycott's political salience is a double-edged sword — it raises the issue but doesn't control how voters interpret it.\n\n**Normalizes the government's coercion precedent.** This is the subtlest risk. The boycott focuses attention on OpenAI's choice to take the deal. The more important story is the government threatening a private company with a supply chain risk designation — normally reserved for foreign adversaries — because it negotiated contract terms. If public anger is directed at OpenAI rather than at the coercive mechanism itself, that mechanism survives uncontested and gets used again. Next time it might be a pharmaceutical company, a telecommunications provider, or a cloud infrastructure firm. The precedent is the real threat; the boycott misdirects attention from it.",

Any society with the tech shown (perfect holographic judges, wall-to-wall 4K screens, AI everywhere) would use solar, nuclear, or automated generators instead.\n2. **Why not automate the bikes?** The technology level is high enough for flawless virtual reality and AI celebrities, so robots or machines could pedal (or generate power better). Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation. Food, clothes, infrastructure? Never shown and presumably fully automated off-screen. So why do you need human-generated electricity at all?\n4. **No real growth or escape** The only “upward mobility” is winning a rigged talent show (Hot Shot). Even the winners just become higher-tier entertainers inside the same prison. The system is designed to extract maximum labour and attention while giving the illusion of merit and choice.",

Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation.

Any society with the tech shown (perfect holographic judges, wall-to-wall 4K screens, AI everywhere) would use solar, nuclear, or automated generators instead.\n2. **Why not automate the bikes?** The technology level is high enough for flawless virtual reality and AI celebrities, so robots or machines could pedal (or generate power better). Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation. Food, clothes, infrastructure? Never shown and presumably fully automated off-screen. So why do you need human-generated electricity at all?\n4. **No real growth or escape** The only “upward mobility” is winning a rigged talent show (Hot Shot). Even the winners just become higher-tier entertainers inside the same prison. The system is designed to extract maximum labour and attention while giving the illusion of merit and choice.",

The government has been doing mass surveillance for decades, it's not some new idea with Ai. \n\nAnthropic is deeply integrated into DOD systems at this point. The federal government doesn't want to set a precedent where a private tech company, which is intertwined with mission critical systems, has any say in what the DOD does. This is doubled once said tech company publicly opposes the feds. \n\nImagine Boeing tried to tell the government they couldn't use the aircraft they built for them to bomb Iran because the CEO didn't agree with the legality/ethics. The feds would go scorched earth on Boeing just to set an example. \n\nI can't stand Trump and I think his schitzo rant comments on the situation don't point out the actual reason why this strong arm is being done. It's clearly a precedent setting situation so they really have no other option but going scorched earth on Anthropic. I can assure you that any other admin at the helm would do the same thing, just not as public/brash. \n\nBut since the stance is anti-Trump admin reddit will cozy up with Anthropic like it's some wholesome tech company now.

I was really sick and out of it that day, so I didn't really think much of what it gave me until I had already combined the critical ingredients. Suddenly I realized I made a really bad mistake, threw open my windows and turned on a bunch of fans to air out the space.\n\nI'll attach a screenshot of the recipe. It probably wouldn't have been a big deal if I combined all the ingredients directly into the vase water first, but I didn't do that. It just said \"combine all ingredients with a whisk,\" with zero safety disclaimers.\n\nPoint is: ethics and user safety guardrails are not only essential, they're woefully insufficient. Military personnel trusting the recommendations of LLMs with these features disabled are going to get a lot of good people tragically killed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c913l00o14mg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89ff59a3fab5470c94a34e634392fe85cbee62c",

(At least, before it got to the \"retaliatory\" phase that we're in now.)\n\nSaying, \"You can't use our product for anything illegal\" is.. at best completely redundant. The government and the citizenry have access to lawyers who determine whether or not the government's conduct is broadly legal or not, and people have the ability to veto the government's conduct with elections.\n\nWhat that caveat that Anthropic is demanding actually does is silently ask to be included into the operational loop for anything that uses their product, which is.. obviously completely untenable? Anthropic's lawyers are not entitled to preview the US government's security policy to weigh its legality in advance. Raytheon is not read into every planned mission in which a missile it sells to the government is used, and they do not separately make the call as to whether a civilian is an \"illegal target\" or \"acceptable collateral damage\" in that mission before okaying the strike. That's the job of a government lawyer. Dell's corporate counsel isn't weighing in on whether their laptop can be used at the CIA blacksite. They sell the computer, or the missile, or whatever, and how it's being used after that point is completely down to the agencies they sold it to. The government can't be running to private companies every 10 minutes asking to pretty-please be able to use the capabilities it has paid the companies to provide to it.\n\nIt very much feels like what happened here is that some nerd at Anthropic, presumably Dario or Daniela, got in a room with Hegseth and just.. said what was on their very San Francisco-brained mind, and they are now quickly finding out that you have to carefully tailor your message for your audience, and there are consequences if you don't. Most of their publicly communicated concerns seem overly pedantic, given that there *are* checks and balances in place to prevent the things they are opposed to (which are seemingly confined to things they believe to be illegal), and it's obviously not feasible for the company itself to continuously weigh in on every time the government wants to use the product they're selling it as to whether or not *they* believe the use case to be legal or not, as though that even matters at all.\n\nGiven the reporting that there was some back-and-forth over the Maduro thing specifically, it sounds like they communicated some discomfort with this as an example of things they don't want it used for, and it sounds like the Trump admin feels like these grey-area, out-of-the-box, type operations are what they think is absolutely required to make progress on dealing with China's potential strategic partners (Venezuela, Iran, Cuba, etc.), in the time they have left before Taiwan kicks off.",

Claude was the clear winner but chat was pretty good.\n\n\nIn other areas I've seen Gemini and Claude as clear winners. I'm not into the tech field in any professional sense so I might be using these differently than many folks here, but imo Claude is consistently the best across the board. Chat and Gemini depend very much on the topic. I'll break out deepseek occasionally but the former 3 are good enough to the point I've been thinking about finally paying for one.",

Effectively handing a bunch of money to Elon Musk.\n\n(The actual engineers at NASA had always wanted to do the reusable rocket thing from the start, *instead* of a crap space pegasus that couldn't even go into space. That's why so many were so eager to join SpaceX, they *cared* about what they could make and accomplish.)\n\nThere is ***no*** agency in the United States Government that is doing meaningful work on AI. None. Zilch.\n\nForget the giant datacenters (which are required to have enough scale - Chat GPT was comparable to a squirrel's brain in terms of RAM.

These people really are trash, trying to extort everyone to get what they want.

But using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties. To the extent that such surveillance is currently legal, this is only because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed records of Americans’ movements, web browsing, and associations from public sources without obtaining a warrant, a practice the Intelligence Community has acknowledged raises privacy concerns and that has generated bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale.\n\nFully autonomous weapons: Partially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even fully autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk. We have offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer. In addition, without proper oversight, fully autonomous weapons cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.",

Despite DOW's recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.\"\n* Anthropic is not walking away from the table, even as significant gaps remain with less than 24 hours before the deadline. The company expects further negotiations.\n\n**The Pentagon** did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement.\n\n**Catch up quick:** The Pentagon and Anthropic are in a high-stakes feud over the limits Anthropic wants to place on the department's use of its AI model Claude: no mass surveillance or autonomous weapons.\n\n* The Pentagon this week started laying the groundwork for one consequence — blacklisting the company as a supply chain risk — by asking defense contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin to assess their exposure to Anthropic.\n* Alternatively, Hegseth threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act to compel Anthropic to provide its model without any restrictions. Such an order may be on murky legal ground.\n\n**The big picture:** The Pentagon's requirement that AI models be offered for \"all lawful purposes\" in classified settings is not unique to Anthropic.\n\n* While Anthropic has been the only model used in classified settings to date, xAI recently signed a contract under the all lawful purposes standard for classified work.\n* Negotiations to bring OpenAI and Google into the classified space are accelerating.\n\n**What's next:** Amodei said the company remains committed to continuing talks.\n\n*Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional details throughout.*",

You don't want tyrants to use modern loopholes, so they can control everyone with a robot drone army. You can have your guns, but not going to do much against drone swarms. Best way to interpret it as a decentralized hardpower check against government.  Our greatest supercomputers, can't even simulate a single cell down to the ribosome level. It is wrong to do anything you can't undo. You can't kill someone and then bring them back. Therefore individuals should be treated like blackboxes you can't violate. Therefore individuals need deserve rights, something you can't violate, because you can't take it back. Give humans these freedoms, let them live in a good society with laws, and stability where they can invest. If it is rule of man not rule of law like in a Trump dictatorship, you would always be subject to people's whims, making investment long term impossible. But, idealism is idealism and philosophy is philosophy. The American constitution promises each human brain the right to decentralized hard power check on government. A modern update will be like every human brain has the right to command drones, or the right to own robots, would be a good modern update. If they are linked like a cyborg in transhumanism, they need the process to be transparent and opensource. I still think reverse engineering the human mind is the way towards AGI or ASI. But tyranny doesn't need AGI, they just need good enough pre train vision transformers or cross correlation kernels to recognize a target template. Then they can control a million robot guns. It is up to the American people, whether they want this kind of centralized hardpower in the hands of the few. A few brains who weighting is no better than yours, but who value themselves highly, and in my opinion who won't hesitate to override or enslave your wishes. I think everyone has right to drones and right to robots. You don't want Trump to have a million robot army loyal to him, with mass surveillance. I don't think machine vision guns are smarter than humans.... but they don't need to be to let someone control you. Anthropic did the right thing.  ",

Has looked at the development of “Adult content” (AKA porn) Chatbots for financial gain, despite inherent problems of further fucking up young minds, relationships and mostly objectifying women.\n4. ChatGPT is in the process of created ad based revenue through the insidious manipulation of users by inserting brand recommendations into user prompts.\n5. Sam has now made it clear that ChatGPT is up for sale for the use of war, killing and surveillance in the development of US based military R&D without oversight.\n6. Blames humans for their biological consumption needs relative to Artificial Intelligence and its enormous environmental impact regarding water use its inherent environmental consequences.\n\nWell I guess anyone working at OpenAI must be wondering “are we the baddies?”.",

There’s not much money to be made here, and anti-U.S. sentiment is strong enough these days that most Europeans just see both of these companies as equally shitty. It’d be an incredibly uphill battle. I think winning the battle in the U.S. is the most important thing now. Whoever conquers the U.S. at the enterprise and government level gets to dictate its will to the rest of the world. This is literally how the U.S. has been shoving Big Tech down everyone’s throats since Obama. The only way this changes is if China somehow pulls ahead in the AI race, but I don’t know if that’s a change for the better or worse.",

I'm not a fan of the current admin either, but people need to look past it. \n\nReddit can't even read between the lines. Trump Admin is crashing out on Anthropic not because of wanting mass surveillance, they've already had that for two decades now. The DOD specifically doesn't want to set a precedent where a random tech company deeply integrated with mission critical systems has any decision on what they do or don't do. This goes double when the tech company's CEO outright opposes the DOD publicly. \n\nImagine Boeing tried standing up publicly to the DOD saying they don't want the aircraft they designed/built being used to bomb Iran because the CEO has ethical/legal concerns over it. The Feds would go absolutely scorched earth on them just to a prove a point.\n\nTrump's schizo rant is all over the place just doesn't get this point across. Let's be clear that ANY admin would put significant pressure on Anthropic for trying this. Other admins just would do it with more grace and not be so publicly brash about it.\n\nRegardless since Anthropic stood up against the current admin they are a wholesome tech company now. Palantir? Yea don't worry about that, continue typing up your post about how awesome Anthropic is.",

Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems.  The DoWC agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.\n\nWe also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoWC also wanted. We will deploy FDEs to help with our models and to ensure their safety, we will deploy on cloud networks only.\n\nWe are asking the DoWC to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept. We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.\n\nWe remain committed to serve all of humanity as best we can.

Autonomous lethality when AI sometimes can’t keep track of conversation details? Geez. \n\nAnd domestic surveillance… well, I doubt anyone that high up cares about my fantasy images of elves and creatures, especially as a non-American but either way, terrible, and seems like I’m gonna have to hunt for alternatives sooner rather than later because one never knows with these companies…\nUnfortunate for any Americans who use ChatGPT and rely on it though.",

The only way you have a chance of having a private AI - is to host yourself (which is why open weight models are so important!).

A human needs constant gravity, food, warmth, air and water, not even mentioning the psychological aspect that would drive people mad in space and just stop functioning. Machines are much more flexible and the brain power part is getting worked on as we speak. It's just not a feasible scenario that human work will be more efficient than machines in space. The only reason would be to punish people for the fun of it. But usually economically factors weight in much higher than some sadistic drive to torture people.

He tells them exactly why it will fail: wind shear, atmospheric density, the uneven burn rate of scavenged fuel. The probability of success is 0.0%.\n\nBut the tinkerer counters with a different statistic: the drones have adapted. They recently started scanning geothermal heat signatures and deep-ground acoustics. They tell the Professor that his hidden cave will be discovered by winter - a mathematical certainty of 100%!\n\nThe Professor laughs it off and tells them to get lost. Suicidal maniacs he calls them.\n\nThe Tinkerer is about to leave when he slides over a piece of tree bark with his \"calculations.\"\n\nThe Professor looks at the bark, his eye starts twitching. \"You didn't carry the one, you absolute savage,\" before angrily grabbing his charcoal. He starts running the calculations. The chance of success isn't 0.0% as he predicted. It's 0.1%. And the chance the drones find him by December is... 100%!\n\nThe Professor cynically sighs. \"Alright.\"\n\nWhen the time comes, the rocket takes three agonizing minutes to prime, forcing the rebels to defend the launchpad with nothing but sticks, stones and bows against two lethal scout drones armed with lasers and chainsaws. They manage to protect the rocket until it starts, but they get absolutely obliterated by the drones. Everyone is dead or dying.\n\nFrom this point onward we see everything from the pov of the tinkerer. He sat braced against a tree, bleeding out. He watches the fiery streak pierce the sky with his blurring vision.\n\nA brilliant, silent flash blooms against the stars, and instantly, the hum of the machines dies as the drones drop out of the air like heavy stones. The dying man weakly turns his head, watching the glowing LED eye of a fallen drone slowly flicker and dim into utter blackness, and a bloody, victorious smile cracks his face as he closes his eyes to the beautiful, absolute silence of a liberated world.\n\nOur eyes are closing. Fade to black.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n>!In the center of the screen a text appears.!<\n\n>!\\> BACKUP MOON DATACENTER CONNECTED.!<\n\n>!The DJI drone startup sound chimes.

The data centers will not be able to dissipate heat. It will work like a thermos. Space doesn’t work like most people think. Not only that but you’d need something like 35 ISS’s worth of solar panels/ infrastructure to put-up one data center. I Highly recommend watching the video Kyle Hill put out on YouTube. Data centers in space are a stupid pipe dream by conmen billionaires that don’t understand the physics. No serious person thinks it’s viable. Watch that video!",

In space radiation is the main/only driver of heat transfer. Radiation drives heat transfer to the 4th order of the temperature delta, so a large temperature delta is needed, but if it is large enough, it can transfer large amounts of heat. Now if the hot surface is about 100 C or 373 K and the cold side is 3 K pointing into deep space, we get about 1 KW/m2 of cooling, while not amazing, this is in the feasible range. If they can increase the surface temp to 300 C the performance jumps to 5.5 KW/m2. \n\nDatacenters in space are an engineering challenge, but not impossible like you described.",

Labels them a ‘woke’ company and implies designation as a supply chains risk\n\nOpenAI takes department of war deal\n\nThe above reads eerily similar to the tactics of an authoritarian government and regardless of views should be highly concerning. The government elected by the people should not give companies the choice of supporting them or facing punishment. Boycotting OpenAI appears to be the only reasonable choice to me.",

Did Amodei fuck someone's wife it's simply a matter of a deterioration in the relationship between the Pentagon and Anthropic? (I read that their relations worsened after the Maduro raid?) Or is it because OpenAI people \"donated\" (bribed) the current administration more? Or is it just the current admin being spiteful and not wanting to lose face? \n\nIf the terms were *different*, then of course there's some fuckery going on. The best evidence you'll see of this is probably if OpenAI employees start walking.

Every other sane company is going to adhere to military mandates since this is an arms race.\n\nDario saying no to the US military is beyond brave. It's crazy and dangerous. Yes, he only has two common sense stipulations. But that doesn't matter. It's inviting untold suffering to not only yourself, but your entire bloodline. Every military knows how to make your existence a living hell; in every way possible.\n\nI'm not american and a complete plebian. Still, in my mind, the US Military Industrial Complex is the most powerful organization to ever exist. China's being the closest now. The government being incompetent only gives the military more power. It goes beyond unlimited budget and no checks n balances. It's complete superiority in every way for over 80 years. Tech, defence, people, espionage, counter espionage, everything. They're competing against all other nations at all times. Even allies. Any weakness at any time means being eaten for breakfast. Losing isn't acceptable. So the dumb and incompetent never make it past the natural selection process or stay at their level.\n\nEither private companies have more power than ever and the military has become weaker or this is theatrics. Not to mention they were the first to accept military usage. It also means their latest non public models are good enough for both mass surveillance and autonomous weapons. Otherwise the military wouldn't care about these stipulations.   \nAnthropic being connected to Amazon means being at the top rung but historically, it means little during an arms race. Imagine if a private company was the closest to building a nuke. But they were limiting capabilities and development in some way. Even common sense ways. Getting the stick treatment is just the beginning. It'd be quick escalation from there. They'd get what they want anyways but make you suffer meanwhile.  \n\nSo hats off to anthropic. They don't have a high moral line but at least they'll stick to their bottom line.",

While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remark-ably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.\n\nIn terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training.\n\nOur findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.",

Even the abstract talks about this being an issue in pretraining also, which would occur before stuff like alignment, RL, etc.\n\n\"_Second, training objectives in both pretraining and post-training phases primarily incentivize confident predictions without promoting the expression of uncertainty for unfamiliar information, encouraging models to output incorrect guesses. Specifically, the next-token prediction goal in pretraining prioritizes fluent continuations over factual accuracy, while instruction tuning or reinforcement learning often favors generating superficially helpful responses, sometimes at the expense of honest refusals to answer._\"\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind, the model _does not_ output an \"answer\" or even a token. When you run the model, you get a score for every single token in the model's vocabulary (for recent LLMs, this is probably 200k or more). \n\n> supressing them will fix the issue as long as the dataset it is being trained is not faulty in itself.\n\nHighly unlikely it is that easy. The fact that they're active when hallucinations occur doesn't mean you can just delete them without affecting the model's other functions. If you find human neurons that are active when someone lies, do you think you can just chop out that section of the brain and have the person go on with their life except that they don't lie as much? Probably not. You can also look at abliteration as an example, which is generally considered to severely hurt a model's capabilities and it is changing something that is a lot less fundamental.",

This comes through in our literature, tests, assessments and all kinds of man-made-structures, it's no surprise that we should be cautious when using a tool based on human-languages that it might have some untrustworthy patterns baked in from \"pre-training\"... just like children who learn to lie very early on and can have disastrous effects if not taught otherwise.
