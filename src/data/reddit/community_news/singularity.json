However, neither puts timelines on it, just that the ultimate outcome whenever it happens.\n\nEliezer position on the likelihood of extinction is widely misunderstood because it is a conditional, he does not think AI alignment is impossible in theory or in practice, and there are political solutions to buying as much time as needed. We have to get it right on the first critical try.\n\nAlmost everyone else that is prominent in the field that spoken about it puts a \\~10%-90% range. Which is mostly a sign of epistemic humility. Geoffrey Hinton estimation of his peers estimation is \\~25%, his personal is 50% but he adjusts it down to be more in line with the others.\n\nSo yes, technically, nobody that is taken seriously is saying that we are all for certain going to die imminently or within the near future. But almost everyone puts significant probabilities, double digit percent, on AI leading to human extinction in the coming decades.\n\n",

We're watching the gap between \"AI can do parlor tricks\" and \"AI is fundamentally reshaping how knowledge work happens\" collapse in real-time. What's fascinating from a technical standpoint is that we're not even at the theoretical limits of transformer architectures yet - we're still scaling up, still finding emergent capabilities at larger parameter counts, and still discovering that techniques like chain-of-thought and constitutional AI unlock behaviors we didn't explicitly train for. The o1/o3 models showing genuine reasoning improvements through test-time compute is a perfect example of how we keep finding new levers to pull.\n\nThe economic implications are starting to hit different now too. We're past the \"will this replace jobs\" debate and into the \"how fast will entire industries restructure\" phase. The interesting part isn't just that AI can write code or analyze data - it's that the cost curve is dropping exponentially while capability is rising. When you can spin up an agent that does 80% of a junior analyst's work for pennies per hour, the math changes fast. Not trying to be doomer about it, but anyone not actively experimenting with these tools in their workflow is basically choosing to compete with one hand tied behind their back.

And ultimately, those tasks are more important for comfortable day to day existence. Gotta have sinks that work, toilets that flush, lights that turn on.",

Over-engineered for simple tasks, under-optimized for demanding ones, carrying dead weight features in every deployment. That's before we even talk about the tragic human design. \n\nAnd here's the deeper problem: nobody actually wants a universal humanoid except the vendor. Of course vendors want to maximize market share, but universal human platform is not where the markets are headed[.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Fordism). Not even close[.] (https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/4/1/28)\n\nWhy would Walmart want a robot that also works at Burger King? They wouldn't. Burger King capabilities are dead weight in a retail context. Businesses want custom solutions optimized for their specific workflows -- that's why enterprise software is never off-the-shelf, it's tailored to proprietary operations.\n\nConsider this. The US airforce tried making a universal cockpit -- It failed catastrophically[.] (https://polkas.github.io/posts/cursedim/index.html) Short pilots couldn't reach controls, tall pilots were cramped, and even average-height pilots had compromised positions. Performance degraded across the board because they optimized for an abstraction -- an 'average pilot' that didn't exist in any real cockpit.\n\nThe humanoid form is poor answer to an even worse asked question about universal applicability. If/when we do get a universally applicable robot design it will not be human-shaped because, to do so, it wouldn't inherit the exact same limitations of the human form. ...Unless the goal is replacement of humans, then that's a different conversation from this one.\n\nIn summary, universal robot agent? Not entirely stupid. Humanoid robot design to achieve this? Stupid. Engineer a platform designed to be customized not one that can do all. \n\nAs for your last point, you live on reddit, you are the autism.",

However, fine motor control for hands which involves new motor designs, new sensors, and whatnot is really difficult. It's really hard to beat the design for a human hand or even copy it while making sure it's scalable. Even Boston Dynamics opted for a way different design",

And you do nothing but insult it because you expect something out of Star Trek when the tech is nowhere there.\n\nJust close your eyes and stay away from these videos for now if their pace of development offends you so much.

How we treat others (which includes animals and AIs) shapes who we become. Morality emerges from relationships, and treating others kindly is important, because we are formed through those interactions. This also applies if the other party is not a moral subject worthy of moral consideration, because it still habituates certain behaviors. Put differently, if you want to be a kind person, you have to practice kindness.",

Even things that seem insanely simple.  \n\nNow try to recreate a global supply chain / on a planet with no materials,  only things you fly in at the cost of like 10k a pound or whatever.   \n\nIt’s likely physically not possible - even with robots that don’t need to breath oxygen- they still rely on things like lubricants that don’t exist.  They still rely on metals that can’t be fabricated.   And how are you even going to run a furnace in space - fire requires oxygen.   \n\nI’m not sure it’s physically possible to recreate a society on the moon or mars even if that society is specifically to keep “robot life” alive.   Computer chips take a year start to finish and insane clean rooms that require atom level percussion - the most complicated devices in the universe.

It is nasty, charged glass but calling it a \"nonstarter\" ignores twenty years of engineering. We aren't using Apollo tech anymore. \n\nWe now have electric shields that zap dust off solar panels and microwaves that melt that sharp dust into smooth, solid roads.\n\nFuture habitats also use \"suitports,\" where space suits dock on the outside, so the dust never actually enters the living space.\n\nMars dust might be rounder from wind, but it’s chemically toxic. You’re basically trading sandpaper for poison. It’s a headache, sure, but it’s a solvable problem, not a dead end.\n\nReferences: \nhttps://www.perplexity.ai/search/the-moon-is-a-nonstarter-you-c-pY7kztmzROiB8UYCAKaTdA",

              "text": "What difference does it make for humans versus artificial life to leave for the stars? One is more efficient to keep “alive” than the other but any life leaving the solar system is wild. \n\nI would not really worry about that event until self replicating and physical autonomous self sustainment of systems are achieved. So basically in a few years the question of extraterrestrial existence should be debated. \n\nIn my opinion, the universe is already a madhouse. And maybe it was nature’s madhouse and it was perfect because nature made it that way, but nature also lead to life’s existence. If nature wasn’t meant to be changed by life, then nature wasn’t made right because we exist. If life’s existence can change nature then it is life’s duty to change nature. If we decided not to change nature, but could have changed nature then we are a waste of nature. The next iteration of life elsewhere will then make the same paths for itself as we did, and the same choices will have to be made. We don’t know if this time and place that life exists is good enough to change nature, but it would be a shame if it was and we held back. The other occurrences of organized life might not be as lucky in time and place. Fyi, by change nature I mean alter the course of macro cosmic events. We know the big bang was N years before our existence, and at some point we think the existence of all this can’t be as conducive to life spontaneously being created for some reason (ie heat death, Big Crunch). We don’t know how long it will take before life can alter cosmic events and we don’t really know how long before conditions make life not possible. Let’s make the most of this occurrence of life. Fuck it.\n\nMaybe the point of nature is for life to spontaneously happen over and over, and by altering nature we are ruining it. We might make it so life doesn’t spontaneously happen as much. But I would argue any life forms are just as likely to self improve and organize systems for cosmic change as others, so why not ours. Is the existence of other life forms just as painless as ours? What if we save them pain when we alter the course of cosmos in ways that prevent them experiencing life? If we reach other spontaneous forms of nature I’m sure we will have an option to some extent on whether we contact them or let them be. We could help other life forms meet the their or our goals. With how we think life came to be here and the amount of other places with similar conditions, odds are pretty good other life exists. Maybe it is nature’s destiny for multiple life instantiations to meet each other and for repercussions to come from it. Maybe we meet up and oppose each other and cancel each other out, or maybe we meet up and multiply our efforts and alter cosmic effects twice as fast. By not leaving the solar system the amount of possible futures is just less. \n\nHonestly I don’t blame humans or creations of humans when or if they leave the solar system. We are just surviving, and that’s all we can do and it’s our prerogative to do so if we choose.",

They will focus all resources & energy into living forever and physiological augmentation, and then once they've achieved that, they'll set their sights on obtaining ever greater dominion over the universe (e.g. by going into space). The rest of humanity will be left to fight over scraps.\n\nBut some time in the middle of this, they will lose control over AI, and an ASI will emerge that will eliminate the elites (and probably all humans). What happens after, is anyone's guess.\n\nThe only way I can see a stop being put to this is if everyone in the world (or at least in the US and China) united against the elites and cast them from power, and a new, more powerful UN is formed to regulate the development and usage of AI for the benefit of all.

From there you'll be able regenerate scenes with instruction on what to change until it's to your liking. The concept of a greenlight will be gone, replaced with the difficulty of uploading a youtube video. From there, one can try and collect ad revenue, but the competition will be fierce. \n\nImo that will be the new model for a little while, but eventually, the computer is going to take the movies a person likes and measure their response with biofeedback sensors while they watch, and generate movies specifically tailored for them. While movies will always be a thing people enjoy, the real money in the film industry is going to be transferred to the tech industry. A five year old will be able to click a button and produce films that compete with what are currently hundred million dollar budgets. In other words, from a career/money perspective, it's kinda over.\n\nI won't end on a super sour note like that. Imo there is a way to still live your dream in this field, but it has nothing to do with competing as a filmmaker. Own assets. Our labor in general is gradually, then suddenly, becoming worthless to capitalism, and the only thing left is to be an owner. If you love true filmmaking, and don't want to press a button, but want to deal with cameras and real human beings, and to tell a story, imo the only way forward long term is to control enough income paying assets to be able to afford it as a hobby. The hobby may pay down the road, there might still be value in human created art, especially as training data, but the bar to being able to participate will increasingly move higher as the market becomes saturated. So like, there is a way, but it has much more to do with being financially literate than it does filmmaking, unfortunately. \n\nI fucking love painting, film, music, etc., but I solidly see the endgame here, so instead of trying to do what I love and getting punished for it, I've been studying finance and putting every dollar I can into something that pays, so I can continue to participate regardless of the environment",

We will probably see the first crew led AI strikes and industrial action this year because of it. New clauses are being drawn up to either compensate the person if affected by AI, or to guarantee some level of human presence. \n\n\nLet's not forget the big A-list stars that still have a major pull on the public. A lot of these actors refuse to act against green screen, preferring real locations, real light, and real practical effects to act against. They will be unlikely to accept any kind of AI involvement in their contracts. \n\n\nFor independent creatives, and regular folk with big ideas, this is really exciting and opens up so many possibilities. \n\n\nAnd my prediction is that there will be a duality, they will sit alongside each other just like theater and movies do now. Both involve acting, sets, directors, lighting, costumes etc but both are very different experiences for the audience.\n\n\n AI generated content vs traditionally shot content will sit side by side. It's a bit like what happened with file sharing and digitization in the music industry. It was hugely disruptive, and many predicted the end of the industry. Fast forward about ten years and all of a sudden there's a huge vinyl revival as people wanted a more analogue experience, higher fidelity and something tangible and real. \n\n\nThe medium is the message, as they say. ",

(Just like some directors today don't even use CGI, but even more so given how divisive AI is.) Plus, \"background greenscreen\" is a very large category where consistency often matters a lot.\n\nBut those are the right cinematic categories to look for adoption, to be sure, alongside purely commercial applications (ads, inflight entertainment systems, etc.).",

People are looking for whole movie generators from one sentence. All they will get is slop. \n\nThe point is a tool, just like codex/claud code. So many low budget directors and indie studios can have the option to include specific AI shots to elevate their movies not replace their movie. \n\nHere’s a simple example. You take an explosion shot by a indie film studio so then gives it to a video model and it turns that exact explosion into a Hollywood blockbuster size explosion with shattered glass and everything. \n\nAnother Example is gun muzzle flashes which are done in post edit by VFX team. That can be done by AI,",

Calling these \"zero-day\" seems to imply that either the author doesn't understand what they're trying to report on or they're being purposely misleading. A lot of these seem to be \"malformed PDF could make the reader crash\" and the like. They're bugs in the sense that the programs shouldn't be doing those things but no one is using them to compromise your system.\n\n**EDIT::**\n\nReading [the original blog post](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/) the phrasing appears to come from Anthropic which implies to me them deliberately forming the messaging that way.  Reading through it though, what Claude did was interesting but not sensational because one the bugs appears to be identifying when _a human being_ identified a bug with certain function usage and just looked for other areas where that function is used to determine whether or not that check was always used with that function. That is useful but you can't assume that just because a security check doesn't exist that the code is more vulnerable. At a certain point you have to consider things like attack vectors to determine whether or not you're just adding more CPU instructions and lines of code.\n\nAnd this is something developers take into account when making determinations. For instance, LD_PRELOAD could potentially be a security risk but it only becomes an issue if you're writing security sensitive code and don't take precautions to account for the existence of LD_PRELOAD (such as happens with `su` and `sudo`). Which is just another way of saying \"we allowed ourselves this flexibility because there just wasn't an attack vector.\"",

In other words, a pixel in the latent represents an 8x8 block of pixels in the decoded video and one frame in the latent represents 4 frames in the video.\n\nA SoTA model like this is highly unlikely to be using lower values than that. So it would be really surprising if it wasn't already doing better than what you suggested. The amount of data the model needs to process still adds up really fast because you have `height * width * frames * channels`. Even with spatial and temporal compression, that's a lot and most models would use 16 or more channels. Wan uses 16, LTX-2 uses 64 as a reference.\n\nYou also can't meaningfully generate keyframes without actually understanding (or whatever you'd call the equivalent for a video model) what is happening in between the frames. Then there's the issue of interpolating. Your AI interpolator can't just do something like look at _just_ four frames and expand that to eight because interpreting those four frames correctly depends on knowing the context of the video and events that occurred before those four frames. So you're back to the model needing to deal with large amounts of data.",

But Anthropic is trying to appeal to the tech workers who make 250k a year, and have a huge office budget because the profit per employee is like 1 million. So throwing huge stacks of money at AI to make it work better and faster, is just a minor operating expense.\n\nThat's the direction they are going... And frankly, it makes sense. They aren't going to be able to beat Google and OpenAI in this race because they simply lack the infrastructure. But they can appeal to the upper market by offering luxury and convenience at a price.",

It’s cheaper, more security competent, handles larger codebases better. And keep in mind that the number of users that use GPT compared to Claude is basically the same comparison as the Empire State Building to a 1 person home.\n\nNot to mention how misanthropic is so against open sourced models and hasn’t released not a single product for the open source community.
