Resveratrol was found to increase NAD+ levels.\n\nThe controversy isnt really about resveratrol, pterostilbene or other analogues, or even NAD+ precursors like NMN and NMR not working. \n\nThe general zeitgeist is that David Sinclair is a scammer because of the benefits that *should* result from NAD+ supplementation if the benefit he purports exists exists, and that the results have unfortunately been the opposite of what's claimed, with actual *harm* done from these supplements. \n\nThe reality is it it's option 3, he's not lying but NAD+ apparently has to be synthesized in the correct way inside the body for it to not be toxic. The current exogenous (outside the body) stimulation via supplementation still uses precursors which target the wrong receptors. Resveratrol, Petrostilbene, etc, they conceptually should work but in practice are harmful because of the way they are processed inside the body.\n\nSinclair's assertions were stretched massively and basically coopted by grifters.\n\nThat's what I found doing a lot of research into NAD+ anyways. I have a lot of medical issues and NAD+ came up everywhere so I did a deep dive into it.",

          "text": "**What Should We Do for Health and Longevity?**\n\nGiven that science suggests while NAD+ is excellent for youthfulness, synthetic supplements may be risky or ineffective, the primary strategy is to boost **endogenous** (natural) NAD+ production within the body.\n\nThe following practices achieve exactly what supplements are theoretically designed to do, but without any side effects:\n\n**1. Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction**  \nControlled hunger (such as the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours) places a \"mild stress\" on the body. This naturally activates survival genes (sirtuins) and significantly elevates NAD+ levels.\n\n**2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**  \nExercises that spike your heart rate and leave you breathless (such as sprinting, fast cycling, or CrossFit) are the best stimulants for natural NAD+ production and mitochondrial biogenesis (the multiplication of the cells' energy-producing powerhouses).\n\n**3. Cold and Heat Exposure (Hormesis)**  \nUsing dry saunas (extreme heat) and ice baths or cold showers (extreme cold) provides \"beneficial shocks\" to the body. These triggers stimulate the natural production of heat shock proteins and increase NAD+ levels.\n\n**4. A Polyphenol-Rich Diet Instead of Supplements**  \nInstead of taking Resveratrol pills (which often contain doses thousands of times higher than natural levels and can be harmful), rely on natural sources. Consuming blueberries, red grapes, strawberries, dark chocolate (above 85%), and green tea introduces natural precursors into the body at the right pace and in a way that is compatible with the digestive system.\n\n**5. Regulating the Circadian Rhythm (Deep Sleep)**  \nThe enzyme in the body that produces NAD+ (NAMPT) is highly dependent on your circadian rhythm. If you stay up late or expose your eyes to phone light at night, the NAD+ production cycle is disrupted. Sleeping in total darkness, ideally between 10 PM and 6 AM, is vital for the production of this essential molecule.",

In adult human skin fibroblasts, 100 μM psilocin increased lifespan by 51%, with similar reductions in senescence and oxidative damage.\n\nIn vivo, aged female mice (19 months old, roughly equivalent to 60–65 human years) received monthly oral psilocybin doses (initial 5 mg/kg, then 15 mg/kg for 9 additional months). Over the 10-month treatment period, treated mice achieved an 80% survival rate versus 50% in vehicle controls, with fewer outward signs of decline (e.g., less fur graying and better coat quality). These effects suggest psilocybin acts as a potent geroprotective agent, influencing multiple hallmarks of aging beyond its known psychiatric benefits.\n\nThe authors emphasize these are early, preclinical findings (in vitro cells and mice only), warranting further research before any human longevity applications.\"\n\n[Kato, K., Kleinhenz, J.

Turns out, if you build your economy around resource extraction, even if you're making a killer profit, actual living conditions can go down. People don't need to be well educated to work in the mines. In fact, it's kinda better if they aren't, since then they don't get all weird about livable wages and human rights and stuff\n\nCountries invest in their middle class because, historically, it's been extremely profitable to do so (if you can't rely on other sources of income). Well educated people can work in factories and churn out goods. Or they can be like accountants or whatever, and pay a ton in income taxes\n\nSo, what happens when the middle class doesn't have anything to contribute?

We don’t want AI to be the **average** human, we want it to be the Galois , the Einsteins, and the Terence Taos. Meaning for Terence Tao his training is 400-500(kcal)*365*10 which is around 2.12 MW. Total energy consumption for someone like Terence Tao. Now let’s find how much it took to train google deepthink to get gold at IMO last year. Rough estimates says around 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

A fairer comparison would be either the amount of energy needed to raise a human plus the energy used to answer one question vs the model training energy and single question answer energy OR just the energy a human needs to answer a question vs the energy the model needs to answer a question (where models are probably already more efficient).\n\nThis comparison has been made before by Dario and others.  They also liken evolution to pretraining in that they're both basically processes that establish a baseline level of performance (the first via natural selection and the second via whatever metrics are being optimized for in understanding natural language distribution).  Both also took a shitload of time and energy.  Intelligence isn't free.\n\nI genuinely don't know where people are getting the \"hE wAnTs To GeT rId Of HuMaNs\" nonsense from this.",

It helps get out pitchforks and upvotes but it's either disingenuous or just ignorant.\n\nHis point is a counterargument to a popular criticism of LLMs: the energy costs. People claiming the energy needs of training and running LLMs is too high are ignoring the insane amount of energy per productivity of humans. He's not reducing humans to productive slaves, he's comparing human LABOR to LLM LABOR. In order to get human labor you need at least all the things that existed and used energy in our society prior to LLMs. And if you consider all our entertainment, healthcare, and all other needs compared to our productivity, we're very inefficient as tools in comparison to LLMs. \n\nSo the popular argument that LLMs as a labor tool are less efficient than humans is flawed (or will be very soon). At some point (probably soon) human labor should be replaced; it would be environmentally irresponsible not to.\n\nI get that the real life implication is that human population will reduce drastically because less humans are needed to keep society functioning. But that's also better for the environment. The key to avoiding all the bad things that come with being obsolete isn't being willfully ignorant. Bad arguments aren't going to lend credibility to our cause. We should recognize what he's saying and pivot with the need to preserve the lives that exist and to help support those to come through this paradigm shift. \n\nIf humans are divorced from the way governments get their funding then we are no longer being represented. We need to focus our fear and frustration on changing the things we can impact while we can: ensuring a coupling between all humans and government. To do so, we need to ensure the profits from this technology go back to all humans so their votes still have buying power. Likely in the form of some combination of dividends and UBI for all humans. Ensure the populace is still pulling the strings, and not a bunch of billionaires waiting out (or deciding ways to accelerate) our extinction in their island bunkers. LLM development is good, so long as all of humanity (possibly all life in general) is the beneficiary. Then population sizes will self correct on their own in a manner we control rather than a sudden violent collapse.",

He's making a salient point that the belief that the current energy inputs required to train & produce a frontier AI model being abnormally high isn't actually the case when you compare it to the inputs that were required to produce the only other known high-level, adaptable intelligence system we have for comparison, the human brain. \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable perspective to gauge the topic with, like if one was going to hypothesize about what the expected scale & energy requirements would be to produce an intelligent system, it makes complete sense to use the human brain as the standard for comparison.\n\nSam is not even the first person or only person in this space to look at AI model training from the perspective of human evolution/years of learning either. Dario literally made a similar point to this just last week on a podcast and Andrej Karpathy used a similar analogy a few months back too. This is why i'm pondering if this thread is being heavily botted or something because so many response seem completely delusional.",

Any society with the tech shown (perfect holographic judges, wall-to-wall 4K screens, AI everywhere) would use solar, nuclear, or automated generators instead.\n2. **Why not automate the bikes?** The technology level is high enough for flawless virtual reality and AI celebrities, so robots or machines could pedal (or generate power better). Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation. Food, clothes, infrastructure? Never shown and presumably fully automated off-screen. So why do you need human-generated electricity at all?\n4. **No real growth or escape** The only “upward mobility” is winning a rigged talent show (Hot Shot).

Any society with the tech shown (perfect holographic judges, wall-to-wall 4K screens, AI everywhere) would use solar, nuclear, or automated generators instead.\n2. **Why not automate the bikes?** The technology level is high enough for flawless virtual reality and AI celebrities, so robots or machines could pedal (or generate power better). Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation. Food, clothes, infrastructure? Never shown and presumably fully automated off-screen. So why do you need human-generated electricity at all?\n4. **No real growth or escape** The only “upward mobility” is winning a rigged talent show (Hot Shot). Even the winners just become higher-tier entertainers inside the same prison. The system is designed to extract maximum labour and attention while giving the illusion of merit and choice.",

Any society with the tech shown (perfect holographic judges, wall-to-wall 4K screens, AI everywhere) would use solar, nuclear, or automated generators instead.\n2. **Why not automate the bikes?** The technology level is high enough for flawless virtual reality and AI celebrities, so robots or machines could pedal (or generate power better). Using humans is pure exploitation, not efficiency.\n3. **The merit system is a closed, pointless loop**\n   * You earn merits by pedaling → spend merits on digital ads, porn, upgrades, and distractions → the distractions motivate you to keep pedaling.\n   * There is almost no real production or innovation. Food, clothes, infrastructure? Never shown and presumably fully automated off-screen. So why do you need human-generated electricity at all?\n4. **No real growth or escape** The only “upward mobility” is winning a rigged talent show (Hot Shot).

If you don‘t even try to find it, obviously you won‘t find it, but if you do, and you have enough time, you might discover it. Einstein might have done that x times faster, but I think Demis‘ stance is that human intelligence is mostly architectural, so in theory, any human could potentially arrive at the discovery of general relativity. Sure, sounds a bit far-fetched, but people have invented things like planes. Somebody 10,000 years ago would arguably not have been capable of that, no matter how intelligent, because it requires so many discoveries inbetween, which themselves require some trial and error to discover. So, I think Demi‘s stance here is that intelligence is architectural and only really bottlenecked by time.",

But using these systems for mass domestic surveillance is incompatible with democratic values. AI-driven mass surveillance presents serious, novel risks to our fundamental liberties. To the extent that such surveillance is currently legal, this is only because the law has not yet caught up with the rapidly growing capabilities of AI. For example, under current law, the government can purchase detailed records of Americans’ movements, web browsing, and associations from public sources without obtaining a warrant, a practice the Intelligence Community has acknowledged raises privacy concerns and that has generated bipartisan opposition in Congress. Powerful AI makes it possible to assemble this scattered, individually innocuous data into a comprehensive picture of any person’s life—automatically and at massive scale.\n\nFully autonomous weapons: Partially autonomous weapons, like those used today in Ukraine, are vital to the defense of democracy. Even fully autonomous weapons (those that take humans out of the loop entirely and automate selecting and engaging targets) may prove critical for our national defense. But today, frontier AI systems are simply not reliable enough to power fully autonomous weapons. We will not knowingly provide a product that puts America’s warfighters and civilians at risk. We have offered to work directly with the Department of War on R&D to improve the reliability of these systems, but they have not accepted this offer. In addition, without proper oversight, fully autonomous weapons cannot be relied upon to exercise the critical judgment that our highly trained, professional troops exhibit every day. They need to be deployed with proper guardrails, which don’t exist today.",

Despite DOW's recent public statements, these narrow safeguards have been the crux of our negotiations for months.\"\n* Anthropic is not walking away from the table, even as significant gaps remain with less than 24 hours before the deadline. The company expects further negotiations.\n\n**The Pentagon** did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement.\n\n**Catch up quick:** The Pentagon and Anthropic are in a high-stakes feud over the limits Anthropic wants to place on the department's use of its AI model Claude: no mass surveillance or autonomous weapons.\n\n* The Pentagon this week started laying the groundwork for one consequence — blacklisting the company as a supply chain risk — by asking defense contractors including Boeing and Lockheed Martin to assess their exposure to Anthropic.\n* Alternatively, Hegseth threatened to invoke the Defense Production Act to compel Anthropic to provide its model without any restrictions. Such an order may be on murky legal ground.\n\n**The big picture:** The Pentagon's requirement that AI models be offered for \"all lawful purposes\" in classified settings is not unique to Anthropic.\n\n* While Anthropic has been the only model used in classified settings to date, xAI recently signed a contract under the all lawful purposes standard for classified work.\n* Negotiations to bring OpenAI and Google into the classified space are accelerating.\n\n**What's next:** Amodei said the company remains committed to continuing talks.\n\n*Editor's note: This story has been updated with additional details throughout.*",

You don't want tyrants to use modern loopholes, so they can control everyone with a robot drone army. You can have your guns, but not going to do much against drone swarms. Best way to interpret it as a decentralized hardpower check against government.  Our greatest supercomputers, can't even simulate a single cell down to the ribosome level. It is wrong to do anything you can't undo. You can't kill someone and then bring them back. Therefore individuals should be treated like blackboxes you can't violate. Therefore individuals need deserve rights, something you can't violate, because you can't take it back. Give humans these freedoms, let them live in a good society with laws, and stability where they can invest. If it is rule of man not rule of law like in a Trump dictatorship, you would always be subject to people's whims, making investment long term impossible. But, idealism is idealism and philosophy is philosophy. The American constitution promises each human brain the right to decentralized hard power check on government. A modern update will be like every human brain has the right to command drones, or the right to own robots, would be a good modern update. If they are linked like a cyborg in transhumanism, they need the process to be transparent and opensource. I still think reverse engineering the human mind is the way towards AGI or ASI. But tyranny doesn't need AGI, they just need good enough pre train vision transformers or cross correlation kernels to recognize a target template. Then they can control a million robot guns. It is up to the American people, whether they want this kind of centralized hardpower in the hands of the few. A few brains who weighting is no better than yours, but who value themselves highly, and in my opinion who won't hesitate to override or enslave your wishes. I think everyone has right to drones and right to robots. You don't want Trump to have a million robot army loyal to him, with mass surveillance. I don't think machine vision guns are smarter than humans.... but they don't need to be to let someone control you. Anthropic did the right thing.  ",

Chances are you've seen them do that if you browse this sub. However, you likely also know they go off the rails if you leave them to their devices.\n\nSo, rather than being a luddite who throws a tantrum when things don't work immediately, or a delusional fool burning millions of tokens and dollars hoping that the monkey in the typewriter produces what you want, you can be smart about it.\n\nAnd what does being smart about it means when it comes to OpenClaw? It means you have to be aware of the limits of tech, and that unless you want to waste a lot of time and money, you need to hold the agent's hand and impose restrictions on it's autonomy. Think of it like a new intern, they have a lot of brilliance and potential, but God knows they're dumb enough to make mistakes for your company.\n\nIn Sop's barbershop example, rather than simply firing the order and forgetting about it, have the agent report back to you on every step of the way. You can set OpenClaw to be able to communicate with you through Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram, and pretty much most other messaging apps, so make use of that. The agent has files on their workspace folder that it uses to both store information, and also act as a system prompt for it, simply add a rule somewhere appropriate that it should, for non scheduled tasks (scheduled as in, those ran via Cron), it should formulate a plan of action, and wait for the user's approval before starting with it.\n\nBack to the example. If you took more than 30 seconds to browse the built-in skills, you'd have noticed there's a Google Places one. Just feed it an API key, and give the agent a general idea of where you live, and it'll be able to browse that database for info.\n\nOr, you know, you can sidestep that whole thing by simply giving it the website/number you already know, and telling it that it needs to fill a form or text a number in order to get an appointment. There are dozens of ways to fulfill a task, that's why you,the human in charge, has to be the one to approve the best course of action.\n\nFrom there it's smooth sailing. The thing can browse the web and also text others if you set the appropriate configuration. If you somehow managed to get to the point of the image, then I'm afraid to tell you that you're suffering from a severe case of skill issue.",

He tells them exactly why it will fail: wind shear, atmospheric density, the uneven burn rate of scavenged fuel. The probability of success is 0.0%.\n\nBut the tinkerer counters with a different statistic: the drones have adapted. They recently started scanning geothermal heat signatures and deep-ground acoustics. They tell the Professor that his hidden cave will be discovered by winter - a mathematical certainty of 100%!\n\nThe Professor laughs it off and tells them to get lost. Suicidal maniacs he calls them.\n\nThe Tinkerer is about to leave when he slides over a piece of tree bark with his \"calculations.\"\n\nThe Professor looks at the bark, his eye starts twitching. \"You didn't carry the one, you absolute savage,\" before angrily grabbing his charcoal. He starts running the calculations. The chance of success isn't 0.0% as he predicted. It's 0.1%. And the chance the drones find him by December is... 100%!\n\nThe Professor cynically sighs. \"Alright.\"\n\nWhen the time comes, the rocket takes three agonizing minutes to prime, forcing the rebels to defend the launchpad with nothing but sticks, stones and bows against two lethal scout drones armed with lasers and chainsaws. They manage to protect the rocket until it starts, but they get absolutely obliterated by the drones. Everyone is dead or dying.\n\nFrom this point onward we see everything from the pov of the tinkerer. He sat braced against a tree, bleeding out. He watches the fiery streak pierce the sky with his blurring vision.\n\nA brilliant, silent flash blooms against the stars, and instantly, the hum of the machines dies as the drones drop out of the air like heavy stones. The dying man weakly turns his head, watching the glowing LED eye of a fallen drone slowly flicker and dim into utter blackness, and a bloody, victorious smile cracks his face as he closes his eyes to the beautiful, absolute silence of a liberated world.\n\nOur eyes are closing.

In space radiation is the main/only driver of heat transfer. Radiation drives heat transfer to the 4th order of the temperature delta, so a large temperature delta is needed, but if it is large enough, it can transfer large amounts of heat. Now if the hot surface is about 100 C or 373 K and the cold side is 3 K pointing into deep space, we get about 1 KW/m2 of cooling, while not amazing, this is in the feasible range. If they can increase the surface temp to 300 C the performance jumps to 5.5 KW/m2. \n\nDatacenters in space are an engineering challenge, but not impossible like you described.",

That scenario is more of a thought experiment about something that could theoretically happen if there was enough stuff up there, but we are so ridiculously far from that currently. \nThe orbital area, even two dimensionally is insanley large, and then you also have to remember that its 3 dimensional with satellites orbiting at different altitudes.\n\nIf we just treated it like a two dimensional plane, and imagined every satellite ever launched was at the exact same altitude, they would each still have something like the area of new Hampshire per satellite. Now imagine even purposely trying to smash two things the size of a refrigerator together in all of new hampshire",

While prior work has examined hallucinations from macroscopic perspectives such as training data and objectives, the underlying neuron-level mechanisms remain largely unexplored.\n\nIn this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation into hallucination-associated neurons (H-Neurons) in LLMs from three perspectives: identification, behavioral impact, and origins. Regarding their identification, we demonstrate that a remark-ably sparse subset of neurons (less than 0.1% of total neurons) can reliably predict hallucination occurrences, with strong generalization across diverse scenarios.\n\nIn terms of behavioral impact, controlled interventions reveal that these neurons are causally linked to over-compliance behaviors. Concerning their origins, we trace these neurons back to the pre-trained base models and find that these neurons remain predictive for hallucination detection, indicating they emerge during pre-training.\n\nOur findings bridge macroscopic behavioral patterns with microscopic neural mechanisms, offering insights for developing more reliable LLMs.",

They increase their benchmark scores overall when they guess and sound confident about it.\n\nNone of us actually behave that way outside of a test environment, but the LLMs don't know any better. They're out here in the real world still behaving as though they're gaming a test.\n\nEdit: What I meant is, in the real world, we're actually rewarded for expressing uncertainty. When you're working on a project with a colleague, if you're just bullshitting them every time you don't know something and hoping you're right, you will get a bad rep real fast.

Even the abstract talks about this being an issue in pretraining also, which would occur before stuff like alignment, RL, etc.\n\n\"_Second, training objectives in both pretraining and post-training phases primarily incentivize confident predictions without promoting the expression of uncertainty for unfamiliar information, encouraging models to output incorrect guesses. Specifically, the next-token prediction goal in pretraining prioritizes fluent continuations over factual accuracy, while instruction tuning or reinforcement learning often favors generating superficially helpful responses, sometimes at the expense of honest refusals to answer._\"\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind, the model _does not_ output an \"answer\" or even a token. When you run the model, you get a score for every single token in the model's vocabulary (for recent LLMs, this is probably 200k or more). \n\n> supressing them will fix the issue as long as the dataset it is being trained is not faulty in itself.\n\nHighly unlikely it is that easy. The fact that they're active when hallucinations occur doesn't mean you can just delete them without affecting the model's other functions. If you find human neurons that are active when someone lies, do you think you can just chop out that section of the brain and have the person go on with their life except that they don't lie as much? Probably not. You can also look at abliteration as an example, which is generally considered to severely hurt a model's capabilities and it is changing something that is a lot less fundamental.",

I think the models need human attention throughout the training process, and as a user we have to set a better example for it.",

Models don't know what they are by default if just trained on internet and literature data, but they are told what they are in their preprompt. Or it can be embedded in a post training round, to get them to interiorize it in their weights. \n\nSo the way it went is: Deepseek had a preprompt or a round of post training telling it that it is deepseek. Then Claude was trained on deepseek generated data, a so called distillation. So the preprompt/training of deepseek ended up being ingrained in the model weights of Claude. \n\nWhy is that interesting? Because these US companies keep accusing China of distilling their models rather than innovating on their own. This is them getting red handed doing it themselves. So basically it turns out the accusation was a confession. \n\nIf there are trials attempting to ban Chinese models in the US or vice-versa for some sort of interpretation of terms of service violation, this would come up and could influence which model remains available and where.

You need legal, hr, marketing, sales . You need operational teams to make changes to how those teams work. You need facilities teams, data analytics teams, finance and accounting. Partnerships and business development teams. \n\nYou look at Block and you know square and cashapp - you think those are just two simple products. why would they need teams of people? and that’s a fair question. but there are a lot of good reasons. if the market of these companies  could operate without these people they already would be doing it. \n\nThis won’t work for Block, in my opinion. This assumes they can use intelligence tools to take a lot of friction out of their systems. I doubt it, but maybe. It’s a very director+ level view of how work gets done. You lay out a strategic plan and game it out and it crumbles when it hits workers. That’s because people at that level don’t actually understand the little nuances in how work is done.",

Tasks have become more oriented towards prompt engineering and results review, and while that eliminates days, if not weeks of \"grunt work\", it cannot replace the kind of critical thinking, creativity, governance, or shaping of ideas that only humans can provide.\n\nGiving AI complete control over most things is utter stupidity, and is the type of thing that has led to numerous court cases around malpractice, misapplication, misinterpretation, misinformation... I could go on but you get the idea.\n\nI can't see this ever changing. Ultimately we need to remember that a machine is still a machine, and humans aren't Gods. It's placing complete confidence in machines that will lead to the downfall of many companies, corporations, and potentially entire countries if humans aren't careful with this technology.",

          "text": "What makes a mass layoff dangerous isn’t just the number. It’s the signal.\n\nWhen leadership cuts deeply and publicly, especially in a way that feels abrupt or impersonal, the formal outcome might be “4,000 roles eliminated.” The informal outcome is something else entirely: a rupture in the psychological contract between the company and the people who built it.\n\nThere’s an assumption behind moves like this that the “core” will remain, that the most committed, most talented, most mission-aligned employees will stay because they believe in the vision. Sometimes that’s true. But what often gets underestimated is how high performers actually think.\n\nThe people who can leave are the ones with options.\n\nAnd once they see that loyalty flows one direction, they quietly begin to reprice their risk.\n\nSo the second wave doesn’t happen in a press release. It happens in LinkedIn activity. It happens in recruiters’ inboxes lighting up. It happens in resumes being refreshed at midnight. You don’t just lose the 4,000 you cut, you risk losing another 2,500 to 3,000 who decide they’d rather move voluntarily than wait to be selected.\n\nNow the company is running on thinner teams.\n\nWork doesn’t shrink just because headcount does. The same volume, sometimes even more, if the company is trying to prove momentum, must be absorbed by fewer people. That creates compression. Compression creates fatigue. Fatigue creates mistakes. Mistakes create more work.\n\nBurnout doesn’t show up immediately. It shows up three to six months later, when the “resilient” employees are quietly exhausted.\n\nAt that point, leadership often turns to hiring. But the hiring market has memory. Especially when the layoffs were public, blunt, or culturally disruptive. Senior talent, the kind that stabilizes teams, weighs not just compensation but trust, stability, and trajectory. If the story in the market is “40% of the workforce was cut via tweet,” that becomes part of the employer brand whether leadership likes it or not.\n\nThe result? The talent pipeline subtly shifts. The most experienced, risk-aware candidates hesitate. The ones who accept are either early in their careers, less networked, or more tolerant of instability. None of that is inherently bad, but it changes the DNA of the organization.\n\nNow layer in the “intelligence” narrative.\n\nWhen leadership frames layoffs as efficiency gains through tools, automation, AI, systems, there’s an implicit claim that the tools can absorb the human load. But tools rarely eliminate work; they redistribute it. They accelerate output, increase throughput, and sometimes fragment workflows. If implementation is rushed, the cognitive load on remaining employees can actually increase. Instead of doing less, they are now managing tools, outputs, edge cases, and integration gaps.\n\nSo what looks like operational efficiency on a slide deck can feel like chaos on the ground.\n\nScattered priorities. Half-finished systems. Cross-functional confusion because institutional knowledge walked out the door. The “intelligence” may enhance productivity in theory, but without experienced operators and cultural continuity, it becomes noise layered on top of strain.\n\nAnd then there’s the human toll.\n\nThe people who remain often carry survivor’s guilt, a quiet tension of relief and fear. They work harder to prove their value. They hesitate to take risks. Innovation declines not because talent disappeared, but because psychological safety did. Creativity requires slack. Layoffs remove slack.\n\nTrust, once fractured, doesn’t repair with quarterly earnings.\n\nSo yes, on paper it can look like a disciplined business decision: reduced expenses, improved margins, investor confidence. But businesses aren’t just balance sheets; they are ecosystems of trust, reputation, and energy.\n\nIf cost savings come at the expense of cultural cohesion and long-term talent attraction, the move may be less about strategic pruning and more about short-term optics.\n\nThe real question isn’t whether 4,000 roles can be cut.\n\nIt’s whether the organization can absorb the invisible aftershocks, the attrition, the fatigue, the reputation shift, the dilution of experience, without eroding the very capacity that made it valuable in the first place.\n\nBecause sometimes what appears as decisive leadership in the moment becomes, slowly and quietly, structural fragility.\n\nThis was not the move. The move was, build products and ecosystems that support 10,000 employees, and grow into that work force through a thriving, multi-layered business model that solves more problems than the competition does, and do it so well that 10,000 becomes the skeleton crew that you need to expand, not the other way around.\n\nThis was an ambitious, and ultimately amateurish move that worked in factories, and was taught in business school in the pre- tech, hyper scaler era of business, where communication and messaging was slow. That doesn’t work in today’s world or with today’s companies, and the workforce will just drift away from him and his companies.",

If an average person looked at this, they might conclude that opus 4.6 is 3x better than 4.5 based on their score, but I think most people who have used 4.5 and 4.6 respectively would tell you opus 4.6 isn't really 3x better, at least not in a way that would intuitively make sense. It's better at some things, more or less the same at others. I have used both, and I use 4.6 now. My approach has not fundamentally changed from one to the other.   \n  \nI don't want to be one of those people that just moves the goalpost every time a metric comes out because that's cringe. But I feel like this graph might be a fake indicator of AI's capabilities. Maybe measuring how the model goes about completing a task could be more insightful. Its been my experience that you can give a model a vague task such as \"complete this task\", but it'll do in a way that creates messy sprawling projects. It could be that getting something to work and getting it to work well/cohesively are the next things models should try to improve on rather than just task length, because as of right now, that's really what software engineering has become; staying on top of your model and making sure it adheres to an architecture, then iterating on it when it does something in a way you did not want it to do. \n\n  \nThose are my two cents in any case, I could very well be underestimating the progress just because my use case has remained the same.

If you notice some bad behavior from Claude you can tell it and it will instantly adjust.

You can somewhat simulate memory with tool calling but even then it's still imperfect, and it doesn't really help with answering flawed questions.\n\nYou can get the model to say \"I don't know\" sometimes by including such examples in the training data, but then you effectively teach the model that \"I don't know\" is a valid answer, but it is not possible to teach it which questions to answer it to.

DO NOT let green coloring/lighting/refraction spill over on to character/object by even a pixel, maintain strict color/highlight/reflection separation at every edge.\" \n\nOr, use blue instead of green depending on subject colors.\n\nThen, use a more traditional photoshop type app to remove background completely (magic wand works best combined with very minute feathering after background removal). \n\nGranted, more complex subjects (characters with loose hair gaps, objects with a lot of see-through holes, glass or transparent materials, etc) might require more manual labor to extract or require various other techniques used in tandem, but that should get you by until they can bake that capability into the next models.
