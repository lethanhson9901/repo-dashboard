The infobox tallies two main sources for this\n\n1. 3,000 in Illinois [according to NBC Chicago](https://www.nbcchicago.com/investigations/could-ice-have-lost-3000-immigrant-arrestees-in-chicago/3844220/).\n2. 1,200 in Alligator Alcatraz according to the [Miami Herald](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article312042943.html) and [AOL](https://www.aol.com/articles/hundreds-detainees-reportedly-missing-ice-180733751.html).\n\nNote that the framing of the tweets is prone to misinterpretation, as show in this thread. There is currently no evidence of systemic murder/extermination, rather these people are made \"missing\" to strip them of their legal rights. This allows the government to detain them, deport them, and imprison them in foreign countries like El Salvador without a legal justification and a proper trial.

It is not really a surprising development, but it does clearly display the reality of unconstrained power. \n\nIf our government claims the right to kill American citizens in cold blood in the street using poorly trained masked heavily armed \"immune from prosecution\" secret police (they are masked), why would any American citizen believe that votes in upcoming elections will be honestly counted?",

A 300 kWh pack is \\~4100 lbs.  It lives underneath in otherwise wasted space - the whole bottom of the vehicle is an aluminum plate, then a plastic skid plate to protect it.\n\nCharging can be really fast - a vehicle like this will be able to charge at almost a megawatt.\n\nAnd most critically, a 200 kWh pack, at $20 a kWh, is only 4k.  (on a 50k-80k vehicle).  They will be cheap, the vehicle itself can sell for less than the ICE vehicle, and it *also* saves you money the first month on fuel, if you can charge at home.",

However, just because a battery is in an EV, doesn't mean that it is going to be great.\n\nKeep in mind that this is based on these first-run sodium ion batteries.

Has to be one, right?\n\nThe HUGE drawback nobody really talks about.\n\nLFP is like 3.18 volts at 10% and 3.33 volts at 90%. \n\nSodium is 2.55 volts at 10% and 3.74 volts at 90%.\n\nOur inverters and electronics can't handle that type of swing. Can you design things to work with that? Sure. I'm not sure we're going to be using the full depth of sodium batteries. Kinda like lead acid. We don't use the bottom 50% of a lead acid battery. So if we only use 50% of a sodium battery. If sodium batteries are half the cost. They really cost the same. Then again, if sodium has twice the lifetime and twice the cycles. They're the half as cheap again. \n\nThe weight & volume of the batteries become a problem if we can only use 50% of the battery. If they're already more heavy and now you've got to carry twice as much. That adds up. If we can put them in a car and use 10-90% like other lithum batteries. The weight really isn't a problem. We've got heavy SUV's in the USA. Its really the rest of the world that will struggle more with their tiny vehicles with the volume of sodium batteries being larger. I'm guessing they'll just have the driver sit a couple inches higher and solve the issue there. \n\nCould I be wrong about all this? Sure.",

As if this argument doesn't apply to basically the entire developed world. \n\nAs if none of the technological or medical advancements we enjoy should exist because we have not yet reached an egalitarian world in which these benefits are universally available. Like it's the technology that's bad rather than the social system.\n\nThe goal is to develop beneficial technologies, and push to disseminate their benefits to the most people. Not halt technological progress because we *assume* it's benefits will not be available to some people.\n\nIt really gets tiring after a certain point. We can sit around forever dooming about a Cyberpunk dystopia every time any news comes out about somebody working on some new technology, but is that really what we're about here?",

He would claim it's a very recent experiment he performed on his own child first. (actually he first did it forcibly on his home's manservant who was also child at that time).\n\nYou ask to see approval of this practice from royal society > he doesn't have it.  \nYou ask the opinion of other doctors in the town > They call him a quack/fraud  \nYou read the existing literature on this medical treatment > the very thought has never occured to anyone !\n\nAt this point you grow very very mad and attack him like a reddit commentor using advanced slurs that would later be re-discovered in the 21st century, and threaten to expose him by reporting him for conducting illegal experiments on children.\n\nHe totally refuses to administer normal medicine beyond the standard palliative care administered in hospitals as he already knows that you ain't going to listen and decides to go back to his workbench to work on his own thing.\n\n1 month later you're dead and Jenner has been appointed Physician Extraordinary to King George IV.\n\nIn this case you are a Sam Altman hater. Why ? because he did kind of similarly bad things like Jenner and his illegal experimentals, (he literally didn't use any verifiable epidemiological models/provable statistical frameworks) as well as Jenner owning a child as slave. For example, he is doing similar things to mark zuckerburg and his introduction and handling of social media. Pure Evil !\n\nBut Sam releasing ChatGPT or having established MergeLabs is just like Jenner being responsible for billions of people today having survived covid. Those calling ChatGPT useless would still act as hypocrites who would agree that using AI today is like saying that once you look at how 720p looks you can't go back to 480p and once you know 1080p you can't go back to 720p and so on till you look at 8K through VR and can't ever shake that feeling away again.\n\nHis exact value to human society is neither negative nor null. It might not be as good let alone great, but his very existence has definitely been a key milestone in the overall evolution of homosapiens everywhere !\n\nHomo habilis > Homo rudolfensis > Homo ergaster > Homo erectus > Homo antecessor > Homo heidelbergensis > Homo rhodesiensis > Homo neanderthalensis > Denisovans > Homo sapiens > Homo sexual > Sam Altman",

Is different than enhancement or optimization.\n\nAt the same time, it’s a slippery slope. Once the tech exists, the pressure to expand its use is inevitable. Even if intentions start good, capability tends to outrun ethics and regulation, especially when money is involved.\n\nWhat worries me most isn’t the science itself, but who gets to decide what counts as a “defect” and how quickly that definition could narrow human diversity, including forms of neurodivergence that also bring creativity, insight, and value.\n\nI don’t think a total ban is realistic (bio-tourism and black markets would exist regardless), but pretending this is ethically simple is just untrue. This needs extremely tight guardrails and global coordination\n\nThat all being said, this interests and excites me and I’ve been looking forward to when research/humanity would take us here.",

Do people steal things in star trek universe? Yes. But the technology makes it so stealing something is veeeery discouraged: unless you have stealth technology, the person could simply ask the ship (which monitors EVERYTHING, a very important fact) and ask who took it. They could also just print a copy if they wanted.\n\nSo, while making it illegal to replicate real people within the holodeck could be a guardrail built in, they don't see any purpose because social media doesn't exist in star trek: anything you do at the holodeck doesn't affect anybody outside of it (sci fi tropes excluded). And the reality is that the dangers of AI attachment are well known. You couldn't make deepfakes about someone interesting because... anyone else could have done the same thing. It is not special, it is not scandalous, it is just creepy. And if it wasn't for our current social culture, making a deepfake of someone becomes so trivial at some point that it is not any special, it is just harassment, if is used for that reason.\n\nJust like someone can already masturbate thinking of whoever they want, picturing them in their mind, AI allows one to do the same with a \"real\" picture. Our moral conundrum happens because we find it immoral and  unethical AND because of it we want to control it via laws. Stealing in the universe of star trek is still wrong, and quite likely would get someone in trouble with the law depending on what was stolen, but the behavior wasn't controlled via law enforcement and instead through culture and peer pressure for morality adoption.\n\nNaturally, this only exists in a world where technology allows it, but we literally went through the same transition when pictures and videos became ubiquitous technology: there was nothing in the law, until then, about taking pictures of people in private, or in the street, etc. Paparazzi are still a huge problem and have been for decades. We even had one implicated in the death a very liked royal princess.",

They think that AI is actually somewhat aware of what it's saying, that it can reason, that it has 'thoughts' and opinions, generally that it forms 'ideas' similar to how a person does. And if you attach a recognizable voice and face to an AI, forget about it; they will quickly fall into the trap of thinking they're actually speaking with that person. Even though they know they're not, they assume it's acting the same way that the real person would have. \n\nThey don't understand that it's nothing like a person. It's more like predictive text on your phone. It doesn't know anything or think anything. It has been fed tremendous amounts of data and then finds patterns in that data. When you give it input, it will return the closest matching pattern of the response that it can match based solely on the data it has been trained on. \n\nE.g. normally when someone says, Good morning, one of the most common responses is, Hi good morning how are you? Most AI's will have been trained on data that includes this interaction somewhere in some form. So if you say good morning to it, it will respond in kind as you would expect.

And I believe the idea of having someone sycophantically pandering to me, despite it not being true, has always made me very uneasy.\n\nIt's hard for me to imagine someone deriving a sense of love and safety from false adulation.\n\nI'm curious to know what you think. Do you think that it's potentially a step on the way to self-love for a lot of people? Do you think that having someone treat you like an infallible idol is a move in the right direction? Because alarm bells ring for me, but maybe it's just because I was raised by parents that never, EVER want to admit fault, and truly wanted to live in a reality where they were treated as flawless. So it really does give me the creeps.",

When Geordie prompts the computer he accidentally uses a slightly different wording in his prompt when he sais \"create a character capable of defeating data\" instead of \"create a character capable of defeating sherlock holmes\" and the only way the computer can do this is to make Professor Moriarty conscious of the world outside the holodeck and the ship itself which is why this holodec character ends up trying to take over the ship.

Also, the AI here is limited to the holodeck. It's not the ship, per se. So here, no, the ship could not solve the problem.\n\n_Could_ they put a controlling, monitoring AI in place? Sure. But thst's not what the society in these stories does: so no, not a problem with either SF or trek in specific.\n\nYou want problems with trek, start with the ridiculous \"whoosh\" the spaceships make from an outside observer's viewpoint. :)\n\nMeanwhile, here and now, we're not smart enough to elect capable people to lead us and see to our society's most critical needs. Instead, we are being told we \"need\" to have Greenland. Not healthcare, climate remediation, adequate food and housing, vaccinations, security in our homes... ugh. \\[_throws hands up_\\]\n\nWe _already_ have problems stemming from these systems being inserted in decision-making and surveillance loops: misidentifications, unjustifiable employment rejections,  gross judicial case mishandling, etc. The whole \"we'll let the AI do it\" thing is an _incredibly_ bad idea for any human social or legal issue at this point in time. Imaging that it will be a good thing in the future _is_ SF right now, too. That question remains profoundly open. Which makes answering it in different ways in SF pretty much a proper core value in designing premises _both_ ways.\n\nWe should only be so fortunate to make decisions as reasonable as are common in trek. But here we are.",

Relationship only has value if person is real which has flaws.\n\nNo, this is already an throughly explored concept in both psycology and many religious lessons. Even if someone, say an AI that is very very complaint and obedient, people will still find the difference in agreeableness between different events and experince them as lows and highs. \n\nThe bad thing that having relationship with AI is not that its fake and \"bad\" in itself or the relationship is bad. It is that it makes the person have higher standard for agreeableness that might not exsist in other humans. Though it is only a pure negative for the 3rd party.\n\n2. Criminality/ morality of copying someone’s likeliness.\n\nThis allready exsist. If you made love to a cardboard printout of a celebrity, in most countries, thats not something that would be illegal. As for morality, most people have an genetic intuitions on moral right and wrong, but most cant logically define it. Well, it is defined, watch the video by Veratasium on Game Theory, to understand it. \n\nThere is nothing morally wrong with what leforge did. The video presenter thinks its morally wrong because he feels that its degrading to the orginal owner of the likeness, because impersonation is inherently wrong. However in this case it is not used to be inpersonating nor purposefully degrading.\n\nAnother case could be made at the victim's reaction to feeling violated at \"being used like this\". It is really intresting that you would find some to think its fine to have their digital recreation to be violated and some not. More inrestingly you will find that its almost always the male to not care, while the female does. Ex, Keanu thinks it be cool if people made love to his digital game character while Carrie Anne thought it would be gross, in an invertview about video game appearances. This is also something that is genetically instinctual, as personal image of \"chastity\" or \"pureness\" is not as important to the social status of boys vs girls, which uh.. is important in survival and reproduction. \n\nSo in the age of logic and reason. Perhaps it should be an personal choice. That the computer be programmed to only be able to reproduce holograms of people that have consented to being reproduced. But at the same time, anyone can take a picture of you and jerk off to it and what the fuck does it matter if nobody knows.\n\nFinally, in the context of rights to personal likeness, it especially matters to people whos likeness is important to their carriers or professions. Celebrites or public figures rely on their persona, the look of their face as an important factor of their livelihood. Which should have obvious protections. However it could also be argued that any face that is produced by a human belongs to humanity, and should be freely used as long as its not damaging to the original.\n\nAnyways, the guy is just another sudo intellectual with the classic overly animated hands and crazy eyes trying to convince the view of something with the way that he talks, not the content of what he says. This is why I never look at ticktok or reels or whatever sub 5min video format, aside from cute animals ofc lol",

                  "text": "Not to get on a solipsism debate but other humans only have the appearance of sentience and I just assume they actually are. If we are sentient then it seems to be an emergent property of neurons which themselves are not seemingly sentient. When I say sentient, I mean the waking state of being self aware, although to define more strictly is a bit difficult. If causality holds and at least one mind is sentient then there is something causing that sentience, if there is something causing it then theoretically it can be reproduced. Given that there seems to be 8 billion sentient people around, sentience seems pretty reproducible. Of course it may be the case that causality doesn't hold which would also mean science, technology, engineering, really any inquiry would be useless as there is no further understanding, it is because it is and that's that. I find that to be unlikely and unfitting of all the other bits of reality we have come across so far.",

The MC being new to that world still questions if the machine intelligence's are happy with their life, and what is their purpose. They said that they're happy, and their purpose is love, to spread love, to record love, and to experience love. \n\n\nThis happened is because a majority of the training data from all the humans was porn and dating simulators with many humans desiring AI girlfriends.\n\n\nI'm personally leaning towards that reality happening.",

Directed by Connie He, the film follows Ada, a sleep-deprived woman whose frustration with noisy neighbors spirals into surreal, expressionistic hallucinations.\n\nThe project is a collaboration between veteran animators and Google DeepMind researchers, with a core goal: **use AI to amplify artists’ creative control, not replace it**.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* **Artist-first pipeline:** The creative vision came first. Storyboards, character designs, and painterly styles were fully defined by human artists before AI entered the process.\n* **Custom-trained models:** Researchers fine-tuned Veo (video) and Imagen (image) models on the artists’ own artwork, teaching the AI highly specific visual styles and character rules from just a few examples.\n* **Video-to-video over text prompts:** Instead of relying on text prompts, animators created rough 2D or 3D animations in familiar tools (Maya, TVPaint). AI then transformed these into fully stylized shots while preserving timing, motion, and performance.\n* **Iterative, film-style workflow:** Shots went through dailies, critiques, and multiple revisions. New tools allowed localized edits to parts of a frame without regenerating entire scenes.\n* **AI as a collaborator:** The models handled hard-to-animate expressionist styles, improvised creative details when guided (like extra hair tufts), and scaled shots to 4K while preserving artistic nuance.\n* **Mutual learning:** Artists gained new expressive capabilities; researchers gained hands-on experience shaping AI as a filmmaking tool.\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThe film demonstrates a hybrid future for animation where generative AI functions like a powerful new brush or effects pipeline—guided tightly by human intent, integrated into existing workflows, and used to unlock visual styles that would be prohibitively difficult with traditional methods alone.",

Because they are treating the model as essentially a \"compiler\", but where as code compiler is 100% deterministic, these models will never, something over thousands of frames is going to be \"wrong\". In one scene the color of the shirt is going to be one hex number and in another slightly different etc. And then the artist has to go and manually edit over the final footage which is a really bad and clunky way of altering stuff, you are painting over 10 layers instead working with just the layer you want to alter.\n\nFor animations, for AI to get as broadly adopted as in programming, instead of giving sketches and getting final result, it would be better if AI could instead spit out a composition project file that you would open in software like Nuke, it would have all the layers, all the animations, and then when you need to alter something it would be very quick and easy. The reason I don't see that  happening anytime soon, is that the biggest problem is that, unlike trillions and trillions of lines of programming code you can find on the internet to train the models, there isn't much of that on the internet. There are just very few open source animation projects. And even with closed source, how many digital projects someone like Disney has? Maybe few thousands? Tens of thousands? That's nothing. Someone will eventually make it, but it's not going to be anytime soon, slop models are so much easier. ",

The benchmarks imo don't really reflect real world usage, and while its ok, I still have my GPT, Grok, Gemini subscriptions. \n\nI was impressed with Deepseek R1. It had many innovations and was impressive. I am keenly waiting for V4. It sounds very impressive, and able to do things that previous Chinese and Opensource models weren't really good at. \n\n Deepseek V4 seems to have people keen in anticipation even without benchmarks. It rolls in in February, and is meant to create frameworks that other free models like Kimi will use in the future. Im hoping its good enough that I can replace GPT-120b oss as my local model, and get rid of 2 cloud subscriptions.",

Copy paste a random math contest question from AOPS and ask the model to identify the exact contest it was from without websearch and nothing else)\n\nKimi K2 some months ago took forever, because it wasn't following my instruction and started *doing* the math problem, and eventually timed out. \n\nKimi K2.5 started listing out contest problems in its reasoning traces, except of course those contest problems are hallucinated and not real (I am curious as to if some of those questions it bullshitted up are doable or good...), and second guesses itself a lot which I suppose is good, but still confidently outputs an incorrect answer (a step up from a few months ago I suppose!)\n\nGemini 3 for reference *confidently* and I mean *confidently* states an incorrect answer. I know the thinking is summarized but it repeatedly stated that it was *absolutely certain* lmao\n\nGPT 5.1 and 5.2 are the only models to say word for word \"I don't know\". GPT 5 fails in a similar way to Kimi 2.5. \n\n\n\nI do wish more of the labs try to address hallucinations.\n\nOn a side note, the reason why I have this \"test\" is because last year during the IMO week, I asked this question to o3, and it gave an \"I don't know\" answer.

I do not expect it to identify the problem and frankly I don't *want* the model to identify the problem. The ability to say this in of itself is what's important. \n\nOf course there can be tests where this is true even with websearch turned on, but those prompts would usually be very complicated and a model like GPT 5.2 Thinking would probably be spending 10+ minutes on it. This test is supposed to be relatively quick. \n\nhttps://x.com/i/status/2012204446864834613\n\nAnyways surely you can see why it's important to test for hallucinations? Looking into the reasoning traces is also important. Whether the model seems to be confidently incorrect, or whether it *knew* it doesn't know but chose to lie anyways, etc. \n\nNow in practice for why you may want to turn internet off, with recent progress on Erdos problems, if you give say GPT 5.2 Pro internet access and ask it to do an Erdos problem, it will usually identify the problem from the internet, then comment on how it's an unsolved open problem and make no attempt on actually doing the question. If you turn internet access off, it *doesn't* actually recognize this specific problem and can actually *try* to do the problem (and recently, occasionally succeeding).",

As such, there is typically a clear short thesis. Understanding this short thesis is crucial to identifying potential squeeze candidates. I would like your help with my research. It is crucial that you dig through public releases, news articles, reports, and SEC filings to paint me an accurate and complete picture of the security. It is also crucial you inform me on the stocks history, such that i can understand how it ended up heavily shorted. Many of the securities i look into have a clear bankruptcy risk. I need to know the likelihood that security is going to go bankrupt. It is up to you to determine this and support your evaluation with a logical evidence-backed explanation. Another important area of consideration is potential near-term catalysts. These are events or anticipated filings or announcements with the potential to drive price movement in the security. Lastly, I need to understand the security's potential for dilution. Many have outstanding dilution instruments or upcoming dilution via capital raise. It is crucial that i understand the whole picture for a stock as it relates to dilution. Ultimately, I need you to be an expert researcher and analyst.

Of course he's not alive, he's no smarter than my toaster! \n\nWe've used the 'item talking back' as shorthand for 'magic' for so long, we're going to have a weird time explaining to anyone born after 2025 why that's important.\n\nWARGAMES will be similarly meaningless. It's basically a 'dumb' AI at this point. \n\nShort Circuit will be a movie about a robot that's broken. It did follow commands, as robots do in 2025, then it was hit by lightning and stopped following commands. That's it. That's the story. \n\nWarGames is a movie about an old AI that was too dumb to know a game from reality. Kids might even believe we had that back then! \n\nin 2035, a ton of movies from 1980-2010 just won't make any sense.\n\nIt'll be like watching a science fiction show about a magical vehicle with an 'internal combustion engine', that goes DOZENS OF MILES PER HOUR! Each episode will center around a secret agent that catches criminals on horseback. There will probably be an episode where it even outruns a train, after acquiring some special fuel that makes it go 40 Miles per hour! (can you even imagine!). \n\nI can't think of any other technology that was science fiction where we've leap-frogged the entire concept so completely.",

It's that they won't understand why it represented something so incredible that you could base a 90 episodes of television around it.\n\nWe were in awe of the implications of a technology for decades.

And some of these steps cross the threshold from cool that's interesting to OK yeah it actually works. This isn't something that you can point to a benchmark like SWE Verified or Pro and say oh when the models cross the 80% this is what's going to happen. Maybe you could in hindsight but not before. \n\nEither the model can, or the model *can't*. Few people use the models seriously when it's in the middle. Once they reach the threshold, then everyone starts using it. The only question is when do we reach these inflection points across all other domains?",

If the change in coding is really as dramatic as going from 20% to 80% agentic in a few months for very experienced devs then it seems coding has had its emergence from combination of the right harness (claude code) and model (opus 4.5). \n\nI think what happens in the world of SWE is going to be a prelude for the rest of the economy given how much time and resources is being put into SWE by the major labs. It is a very cognitively difficult task, no? So theoretically if SWE can be fully or near fully automated in the next year like Dario is saying then the rest of knowledge work shouldn’t be too far behind.",

That's why Claude Cowork was made. I've had many discussions with people here claiming how OpenAI is disclosing benchmarks of a model that Plus users don't have access to (xHigh), when Plus has *never* had access to \"High\" much less \"xHigh\" in the past, but now Plus actually *has* access to xHigh if you just go to codex. \n\nThey then tell me that they don't code. \n\n...\n\nCodex isn't just for coding. Claude Code isn't just for coding - everything Claude Cowork can do, Claude Code could have done. I like to think of it as, ChatGPT the app/web interface is well \"chat\", while codex is \"work\". It's simply an interface that gives the underlying model access to your computer and can do *work*, which may or may not be coding related. \n\n2 months ago I asked codex xHigh to organize my gigantic downloads folder as a test (you know... someone who just kept everything in downloads...). It sort of worked and mostly didn't, because it didn't access all the files in there properly so it misplaced them (many were PDF scans with non descriptive titles that you either knew what was the file, or you had to look at it visually). But it was *sort of capable*! It also took my entire week's usage limit lol\n\nI also had it look up restaurant reviews and summarize all its findings into a webpage and exported into a file system that can be imported into Google maps. Recently my parents asked about retirement plans (I'm just gonna assume the status quo rather than the whole AGI thing), so I gave codex the task to build something up where I can input some parameters and it can spit out several different models of what the retirement plan and taxes will look like. I wanted this whole thing to be built more robustly than when I just asked ChatGPT Thinking on the web, and also displayed in a manner where your older parents could understand. I had codex redact PDFs, split some 40 ish PDFs by page content, etc. \n\nSomeone close to me recently (in Jan) switched jobs in the pharmaceutical field and was complaining about how her new company does things. The software they used was apparently ancient (and also *made* by their boss ages ago). A lot of forms and documentations took *ages* to make using this software (which was super easy at her old job), including some forms that were essentially duplicates except a couple of fields, but she now has to do it twice manually because the software sucks donkey balls which took like an entire afternoon just for 2 forms. While listening to her, I was just thinking, wow you could very easily have codex or Claude Code just... remake this software in an afternoon probably. Or just have those AI's just *do* what the software used to (privacy not withstanding). And then I'm thinking... either this speeds up productivity at this company drastically, or it means they need less than half the people to do the same work. \n\nAnyways at the end of my rambling, I think the current agents can actually do a lot of non SWE work but people don't realize it. They're calling this a massive overhang in model capabilities and the whole drag in the world adopting it. Its *already* quite capable. Newer models will likely be significantly more so. It's just the normal people don't realize it yet. \n\nI think there will be a mixture of being this inflection point in capabilities, but I think it'll also need some sort of \"viral\" moment where people are made *aware* of these capabilities.",

Let's step back a bit.\n\nMany programmers work in a larger context, with product managers, user interface designers, data scientists, program managers, salespeople, digital artists, etc.  And, ultimately, there are customers, the people who will use whatever the programmers create.\n\nHere's a question that interests me:  within that larger context, one group of people-- programmers-- are suddenly accelerating by like 10x.  So what are the consequences for the larger ecosystem?\n\nWe're going to find out in 2026, and I think it will be... stressful.\n\nFor example, when coding something took a year, folks working on artwork, the user interface, product specifications, etc. could reasonably take a few months.  But now programmers can deliver in a week.  So product development time pressure will intensify on people in those other roles:  \"PLEASE just pick a UI by the end of \\*today\\*, so AI can code the application over the weekend, and we can ship the product on Monday...\"  What was previously delivered in months will now be demanded in days or hours.\n\nAs a special case, how customers deal with acceleration is an open question.  Complex applications have a learning curve, so there is a limit to how fast people can absorb new software.  Some software packages roll out UI changes over years, because coding takes time and customers have to adapt.  But what if that messy UI in Blender (or whatever) could, in principle, be rewritten as fast as it could be designed?  Now customers learning to use the new UI is the bottleneck.",

The build, design, validate, and ship cycle will be much more iteratively agile if devs can deliver in days instead of months because the stakes are so much lower. Devs will get a lot more comfortable with throw away code as we throw shit at the wall to see what works. So much our current and past workflows are determined by the high-risk cost associated with a developer spending time on something. With that constraint removed, product and ux should be empowered to move much faster. Devs might be doing some of the design lift, designers might be doing some of the dev lift too.

I agree with your 100%, most of the incredible things we want to do as humans we would do if we had the tools require a vast amount of physical world labor and physical materials and energy.\n\n*But*...robots can build each other, and almost all of the earth's resources (both underground minerals and energy through solar) is untouched.  Same for the solar system.\n\nAnd the doubling rate is likely somewhere in the range of 6 months to 2.5 years, where robots, using solar energy and minerals these robots mine with tools that robots have built, manufacture all parts used in themselves including the tooling to manufacture those parts.\n\nThat gets crazy pretty fast - the 'bootstrapping' phase of the Singularity would redirect a large percentage of the industrial output of China to make the first robots.  So you reach a production rate of \"1 china\" in 5 years.\n\nSay it's 1 year doublings.  Then \"2 china\" at year 6, \"4\" at year 7, \"8\" at year 8, \"16\" at year 9.\n\nThis process continues until you hit a bottleneck, such as we have covered the entire land area of all developable countries on earth with solar panels.\n\nSimultaneously though there's the Moon and asteroids and...\n\nConclusion : if you think 10-20 years until productive output rates that are 100s of times today's are \"slow takeoff\" then yes, you are correct.\n\nThen once you have 100s of times the resources, you solve the prototyping problem with brute force.  You build \"organoids\" - partial mockups of human bodies - by the billions to study disease and potential cures.  You build starship engine prototypes by the tens of thousands in parallel (different designs), fusion reactors the same way.",

No, because its super intelligent.\n\n2. Singularity is not from a super intelligence. It's from our inability to comprehend something that's too complex which gives us the illusion of a super intelligence.\n\nIm rather laying towards the 2nd scenario because it's very real, given the classic example of people being convinced their phones spy on them even when not actively used, because they were later recommended a product they were thinking or talking about.",

That task may seem impossible at first (and it obviously currently is due to the sheer complexity that it carries), but we are talking about automating a great deal of the whole CompSci field, which is responsibly in great part of all the cool things that we have nowadays (videogames, saas apps, mobile apps, digital music, digital art and pretty much all that you can think digital).\n\nThis in term should enable commonfolk to create bigger and better products. What is really scary though, is that you're most likely not going to be owner of the infra required to tackle such big projects, so if you want to create a custom slack-copy for you client, you're going to have to pay a big chunk of money...",

That's billions and billions of searches that the thing activates, and it's entirely free. And I guarantee you google is spending fraction of what OpenAI was spending at the time. There is so much to gain per fixed unit of compute with distillation and other optimization techniques that it has made \"pretty good\" models basically free for everyone, which is wonderful. But that doesn't mean we are seeing same optimization gains on the other side of the spectrum. In many areas, like creative writing, the gains of top models have stagnated, we are not seeing meaningful immediately obvious jumps.",

We haven't yet seen the bulk of hardware scaling occur (this will kick in this year and next year with the new data centers coming online).  We'll likely see multiple orders of magnitude increases in the late 2020's between these two.  These next few years are really the only time this can happen (as eventually you hit hard resource and financial barriers to hardware allocation). Algorithmic improvements (not even true step change ones like transformers, but constant small efficiency improvements) will contribute another few orders of magnitude.\n\nPerformance has always tracked this effective compute closely.  We haven't yet seen anything in training to really refute that.  It would be very shocking to see a 3 to 4 order of magnitude increase without a corresponding huge increase in model capability.",

And it’s a lot worse at writing code than most people think.  AI is a great tool for helping a programmer work, but can only handle small, isolated problems.   It cannot build complex systems, and I don’t think it will ever be able to.  \n\nI don’t see how AI could ever become good at writing code using inference alone.

It's more likely the same thing will happen to all white collar jobs as happened when automation was introduced to airliner cockpits.\n\nThere used to be three crew members in the cockpit: two pilots and a Flight Engineer. The FE monitored the plane's health, the pilots flew the plane. The automation took over a large portion of both roles. The FEs lost their jobs, because the self-monitoring capabilities of the automation combined with [the simplified display of information about the plane's health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cockpit) meant that they were no longer needed. The pilots kept their jobs, but the meaning of \"piloting an airliner\" changed profoundly, and their primary responsibilities changed from actively flying the plane to:\n\n1. Inputting the appropriate data into the automation so that it can fly the plane\n2. Monitoring the automation to make sure it flies the plane as expected\n3. Stepping in whenever the automation doesn't fly the plane as expected, and try to fly the plane themselves while simultaneously figuring out what's caused the automation to throw a wobbly\n4. Performing a couple of critical activities the majority of the time they're needed, which the automation *could* probably be left to always do, but the potential impact from it cocking them up makes it too much of a risk for anyone to stomach\n\nThe same thing will happen to all white collar jobs, including programmers. 1/3rd of us will lose our jobs, the other 2/3rds will experience a profound change in what our job title actually means, and pivot from actively doing the work to configuring and monitoring automation which will do most of the work for us, and which will present us with a simplified overview of the health of whatever metaphorical \"plane\" it is we \"fly\" for a living, for us to intently watch while we wait for each weekday to end.\n\nWe've got some [interesting psychological effects](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5633607/) from all this to look forward to, but 2/3rds of us will still have jobs, because someone who has been trained how to \"fly the plane\" themselves still needs to be watching the automation and waiting for it to cock something up, so that they can do (3), and they'll still need to be around to do (4) and manually \"takeoff\" & \"land\" the \"plane\" so that it doesn't \"crash\" and \"kill everybody on board\".",

It's been a while since I read about it in much detail (I'm not in aviation by trade, but I did my master's dissertation on a few air disasters) however I'm fairly certain that some major airlines and both Airbus and Boeing are/were actively lobbying to reduce the 2 pilots to 1, and to change the regulations of whichever Air Authorities will cave in to allow fully automated takeoffs.\n\n\nI believe the reason those efforts have been unsuccessful is because the regulations are based on some fundamental survival instincts telling us \"Er, no, hang on, we need a few trustworthy hands on the controls just in case\"\n\nThe repositioning of humans as monitoring & redundancy measures for automation is gradually going to be extending to a lot of different fields, and it carries a not insignificant risk, because the one thing you can guarantee that the owners of companies will always want to do is pay fewer humans a salary. \n\n\nAnd the fewer humans available as automation redundancy measures, means the higher number of automations which a dwindling number of humans have to monitor, remember how they work and what they're meant to do, and be ready to rapidly step in when the automation suddenly fails, to utilise manual skills which they're not practising regularly because of the highly automated nature of their workplaces.\n\n\nIt's not an insurmountable risk, but it involves actually taking the time to understand and consider the psychological impact of what this change means for the people it's been made to, rather than just the efficiency or financial benefits to the people who dreamt it up.

As amazing as it is that these models can apparently learn a world model complex enough to imagine/render realistic scenes, wouldn't it be wiser and more efficient to also integrate tools that they can call to map imaginary worlds? Perhaps it's already done to some extent - I'm not familiar at all with the domain - but I'm just wondering if forcing the model to do all this visual reasoning on its own is the most efficient.\n\nA very naive toy example: A vision model could use something like Blender to aid itself in keeping scenes consistent and remembering the state of the world.",

Their models are top tier, do actual productive work, and dominate productive work next to Gemini thru vertex AI, etc.\n\n\nOpenAI on the other hand is entirely reliant on hype because they've gone all in on general user apps, and need to keep raising money just like other startups that rely on scale from huge numbers of people making small payments. Think about how long Uber did the exact same shit.\n\n\nThe companies making their money thru API use are playing a B2B game while OpenAI is playing a B2C game. Their API is expensive and sub par compared to others, and only used by people that aren't aware of the other options or by those with brand loyalty. \n\n\nIt's also why Elon keeps hyping grok, cause they're in a similar position. Whenever you see Sam Altman or Elon talking their usual shit it's cause they're trying to convince investors they're about to end everything and they're days away from gigawatt training facilities and AGI and if you don't invest now you'll miss the train.\n\n\nAnthropic I think still plays hype games but they're sneaker about it. They post misleading articles about how Claude was used to autonomously hack leading corporations, or how none of their employees write code anymore, etc. There's a clear distinction in the kind of hype cause they're getting their money from people trying to do work. Sam/Elon are trying to get money from investors.",

AGI I normally see defined as being able to perform at the human level for \"all cognitive tasks\". If it cannot, for example, look at a screen and tell you if the color it sees is red or blue, but it can just write some python that reads the hex code and tell you, that might be functionally a similar outcome, but it clearly cannot perform the cognitive task of \"observe the color\"",

Many economists can't even conceptualize what's coming as they seem to suffer heavily from normalcy bias. Most of the systems we have today were born out of necessity and both AGI and especially the subsequent ASI would either remove these necessities compleatly from the picture or provide a solution which would turn \"keeping the current systems\" into nothing but a liability (and yes, this includes even money as a tool for resource distribution). I heared many of these economists talk about the subject matter and it's pretty much always some flavor of \"disbelief that the technology would be that impactful\" or \"we'll magically drag new jobs out of the ether cause that's how it has always been\".",

          "text": "Ah, the arrogance of ignorance of your own biases.\n\nAGI is defined in terms of human cognition and abilities.  The problem is that there is a logical leap being made that there is a straight line from AI to AGI that is not philosophically valid.\n\nThere is an assumption that idealized or abstracted models of some parts of biological brain functions somehow will result in equivalent or better cognition than humans.  The assumption is just that, a “trust me bro and keep paying me” hunch.\n\nWithin philosophy it’s well understood that abstractions and idealizations are products of our brain’s limitations and don’t capture the fundamentals of reality, they just simplify representations to a low enough level to enable us to reason about the surface aspects of reality.  Throughout history, many of our abstractions, and the science around them, turned to dust when faced with the noisy empirical data of reality.\n\nThere is a conceit in thinking that our models of cognition are remotely anything like real cognition.  Our representations of neurons throw away the real details and we claim our abstractions are boosting the signal over the noise like that is a good thing, effectively biasing the patterns our models detect and predict.  This is the mistake made with every generation of technological progress.  Our models of cognition are always described using the latest technology of the day. Last generation it was “electrical brains”,  this generation it’s “computational brains”, next generation it will be “quantum brains”.  The idealized abstractions keep coming but we’re still waiting on human-like cognition.\n\nWe ignore the fact that biological neurons are just one biochemical expression of what all cells in our body are doing and that inferencing occurs between most cells.  We deny the interconnectedness of body and cognition as though one works without the other and that either one can be replaced by a mechanism.  Despite the fact the biological cells are an expression of evolutionary survival in an infinitely complex universe, something for which our fragile models have not done the hard miles.\n\nAGI is not coming soon.  Proper AI might finally arrive if we are lucky, and we will have to settle for that.  LLMs and their Deep Learning ilk are not really AI, they’re a magic card trick played with lots of tensor representations.  LLM cognition is all in the eye of the beholder and the hundreds of thousands of human post-training data curators, and not in the mechanics of the trick.  LLMs might get us to functional AI once all of the many overlooked (and handwaved) problems are resolved in a few years time. But AGI? Pah!  Might as well say that you can grow real strawberries out of the word “strawberry”.",
