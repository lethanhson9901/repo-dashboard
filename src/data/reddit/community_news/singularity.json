People don't need to be well educated to work in the mines. In fact, it's kinda better if they aren't, since then they don't get all weird about livable wages and human rights and stuff\n\nCountries invest in their middle class because, historically, it's been extremely profitable to do so (if you can't rely on other sources of income). Well educated people can work in factories and churn out goods. Or they can be like accountants or whatever, and pay a ton in income taxes\n\nSo, what happens when the middle class doesn't have anything to contribute? The 1% used to *need* the 99%, to do all their accounting work or whatever. But now the robots are doing all the accounting. So what do we need to keep all these poor people around for?

We don’t want AI to be the **average** human, we want it to be the Galois , the Einsteins, and the Terence Taos. Meaning for Terence Tao his training is 400-500(kcal)*365*10 which is around 2.12 MW. Total energy consumption for someone like Terence Tao. Now let’s find how much it took to train google deepthink to get gold at IMO last year. Rough estimates says around 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

A fairer comparison would be either the amount of energy needed to raise a human plus the energy used to answer one question vs the model training energy and single question answer energy OR just the energy a human needs to answer a question vs the energy the model needs to answer a question (where models are probably already more efficient).\n\nThis comparison has been made before by Dario and others.  They also liken evolution to pretraining in that they're both basically processes that establish a baseline level of performance (the first via natural selection and the second via whatever metrics are being optimized for in understanding natural language distribution).  Both also took a shitload of time and energy.  Intelligence isn't free.\n\nI genuinely don't know where people are getting the \"hE wAnTs To GeT rId Of HuMaNs\" nonsense from this.",

Humans run on roughly 2000-3000 calories per day or 2.5 kWh. That does not scale exponentially, it does not double every year and it does not require new power plants to increase intelligence.\n\nI'd get into the actual 'intelligence per unit of energy' math but the easiest way to put it is that \"20 years of eating\" compare to repeated GPU retraining cycles, completely ifnores efficiency per unit of cognition gained (the whole argument feels stupid).\n\nc. Ai doesn't build infrastructure, invent energy saving technologies and, importantly, does not produce more energy than it consumes.\n\nIn short what Altman is doing here is rhetorical sleight of hand designed to deflect criticism rather than actually justify the energy costs.",

It helps get out pitchforks and upvotes but it's either disingenuous or just ignorant.\n\nHis point is a counterargument to a popular criticism of LLMs: the energy costs. People claiming the energy needs of training and running LLMs is too high are ignoring the insane amount of energy per productivity of humans. He's not reducing humans to productive slaves, he's comparing human LABOR to LLM LABOR. In order to get human labor you need at least all the things that existed and used energy in our society prior to LLMs. And if you consider all our entertainment, healthcare, and all other needs compared to our productivity, we're very inefficient as tools in comparison to LLMs. \n\nSo the popular argument that LLMs as a labor tool are less efficient than humans is flawed (or will be very soon). At some point (probably soon) human labor should be replaced; it would be environmentally irresponsible not to.\n\nI get that the real life implication is that human population will reduce drastically because less humans are needed to keep society functioning. But that's also better for the environment. The key to avoiding all the bad things that come with being obsolete isn't being willfully ignorant. Bad arguments aren't going to lend credibility to our cause. We should recognize what he's saying and pivot with the need to preserve the lives that exist and to help support those to come through this paradigm shift. \n\nIf humans are divorced from the way governments get their funding then we are no longer being represented. We need to focus our fear and frustration on changing the things we can impact while we can: ensuring a coupling between all humans and government. To do so, we need to ensure the profits from this technology go back to all humans so their votes still have buying power. Likely in the form of some combination of dividends and UBI for all humans. Ensure the populace is still pulling the strings, and not a bunch of billionaires waiting out (or deciding ways to accelerate) our extinction in their island bunkers. LLM development is good, so long as all of humanity (possibly all life in general) is the beneficiary. Then population sizes will self correct on their own in a manner we control rather than a sudden violent collapse.",

The energy to make a human is worth it because there's something innately moral about making a life more worthwhile.

Thats kind of the whole premise of bullshit jobs.\n\nA lot of jobs don’t exist because the work is necessary. They exist because an org needs to look busy, spend a budget, justify headcount, or keep a contract alive. I’ve seen it up close. My wife had a “business analyst” role on a government contract where there was basically nothing to do. Not “slow season,” not “waiting on dependencies” … I mean legit nothing. A couple slides here and there, random Teams calls where people vaguely talk about “deliverables,” and then everyone clocks out. Whole teams making six figures to cosplay productivity.\n\nSo when people argue “jobs won’t disappear,” I’m like… ok, but a lot of them are already fake. The real change AI brings is it makes the pretending harder to justify. If your job is mostly meetings, status updates, formatting decks, writing emails, moving tickets around… that’s not a sacred craft. That’s overhead. And overhead is the first thing that gets squeezed or automated.\n\nIt’s not even about workers being lazy. It’s the system. We built an economy where looking employed matters more than doing useful work. AI just shines a light on it.",

Spending government money is a serious business so that was drummed into us right from the start ‘tax payers money’ and all that. \n\nWhen I moved over to the commercial world I was appalled by the level of bureaucracy that was tolerated or even actively encouraged. \n\nFirst thing is, each Function, finance, procurement, HR (don’t get me started on that bunch) and so on creates processes to ensure that it will exist into the future and those processes therefore are driven by the Function, business needs are separate/secondary. (There is usually someway to vaguely tie Functional goals to the company’s ‘top ten objectives’ for year xxxx. But essentially it boils down to ‘if you want my function experts to work on your project/product, I’m going to make you dance to my tune first’.\n\nEvery management role I’ve been in I’ve been able to separate the non value adding from the value added work. Being able to actually cut the bureaucracy out however is a different challenge. In one particular instance I demonstrated it would be possible to automate the work of an entire team of, sub contract, data management staff. The plan was blocked because a) it would have left the team leader with no role/team to manage and b) the sub contract company reduced their costs ‘significantly’ (10%). \n\nTeam size equates to manage responsibility/numbers of team leaders which equates to  how far up the organisation chart you can get. Thanks HR for those ‘rules’. \n\nBasically Functions create ‘friction’ in company operations and friction slows down the pace at which get done. \n\nIt is very easy to document ‘what’ has to happen for a product to exist - there are millions of pages of processes documentation - this the explicit knowledge - material specs, test results, manufacturing process instructions. But for a complex product like an aircraft the ‘how’ it is done is in the heads of experienced people, those who’ve ‘done it before’. This is the tacit knowledge. And tacit knowledge is the lubricant that reduces the inherent friction in company operations. \n\nIndustries have decades of experience documenting explicit knowledge, but very little if any of extracting tacit knowledge from people who’ve ‘been there and done that’ (a large part of that is because companies have ‘recognised’ their ‘experts’ with special titles etc. and some of the ‘experts’ jealousy guard their positions). \nFrancois worked hard for many years to get on that standards committee and has earned his 3 weeks every year travelling to the US technical conferences.  \n\nDisruption of an industry is achieved by understanding the underlying friction points in the overall industrial model and build an organisation that eliminates those points. \n\nSpaceflight was one of the industries with the highest barriers to entry due to the way it was organised by and between governments and industry players. \n\nSpaceX and others have shown how it can be done differently and have therefore massively reduced the cost to orbit and significantly disrupted the satellite comms business as well. \n\nThere are 2 reports I wish I’d kept copies of, one was a benchmark exercise done by the Europeans of SpaceX and the other was a review by a long term satellite industry veteran explaining the significance of the Starlink project. \n\nMy rambling is nearly at an end, you’ll be glad to know. \n\nThere will be job cuts in the easily automated tasks that are fundamentally ‘explicit’ knowledge based. And that is a good thing because these are tasks that can and should be automated. And I hope that AI can be used to create/reinforce some cross industry standards for automatable tasks. \n\nThose who can crack the tacit knowledge extraction/exploitation will be the real winners. \n\nFinal word on friction in processes the current No.1 lubricant for reducing friction is the spreadsheet. Some companies owe their existence to the excel spreadsheet (despite having spent millions on fancy data management systems).\n\nThank you for listening to my TED Talk.",

If it's too obvious you can get by doing zero work, nobody will work at all, and what items there are that DO need done get neglected. Some people shrivel up and die when they don't feel useful/busy. There's also the fact that people need money to live, and there's no endgame where they're just like \"oh the jobs went away, I will just politely starve to death.\" Additionally, consider how the rise of this type of work coincided with the rise of the internet (i.e., the previous bout of \"we don't need you because computer\" pushed by corpos). These are all issues fake work was created to address. \n\n\nSo what is the deal with AI bros? Are they really foolish enough to think millions of people will just become unemployed because they say so?

That's about a year and a half after its first launch, and the fleet has tripled in about that timeframe. \n\nThere's also a pretty significant difference: LLMs are pretty readily accessible to the vast majority of businesses today. Waymos are not: they have all kinds of hurdles to overcome before widespread implementation can occur: including driving laws, local regulations, and requiring an expensive (over $120,000 per unit) up front investment in order to displace each already existing Uber or Lyft vehicle. \n\nDespite, that, we are seeing rapid market share erosion of Uber and Lyft in cities where Waymos are present (down approximately 29% combined since 2024 in San Francisco).",

But there are a few problems: Even if you do tax or outlaw the technology, other countries will develop that technology anyways and then force feed it back to you. What's currently happening is a arms race towards AGI. This is not a new technology for society like steam machines, combustion engines or electricity. AGI is the last invention humankind has ever to invent. If it's physical possible (and that is an if, because of physical limitations in computation and power consumption), then a country or organisation will eventually create one. When AGI is created, human labour isn't simply neccessary anymore, not in any case. Even your plumber can (and will) then get replaced easily with a robot controlled by AGI.\n\nThe economic collapse that will then happen is inevitable, the neccessity of a paradigm shift is inevitable, money in the current understanding will be devalued and be worthless. But fear not! You will still have everything you need, you will have a kind of UGI (maybe not money but like vouchers and goods) and you will have all the time you need to be creative, create things, travel, expierence and do whatever you want. If the AGI that gets created, isn't aligned to human values you won't have to worry either, as the end will be rather quick.\n\nAll of this won't happen in the next 10 years of course, so you don't have to worry yet. Just keep in mind to get yourself property in the near future if you haven't already, as this will be more difficult longterm.",

And the automation bump is not felt yet in the economy, companies need to restructure around AI to make it work.

No matter how fast someone can propose an investment, or doing a medical intervention ... they still need to wait for you to approve it, it's your money / skin at stake not theirs.

This is a real problem, because LLMs don’t think for themselves, and they need experienced people to use them. So I suspect that eventually we will have to put energy into training and growing the younger workforce with… jobs that help them get experience.\n\nAI does not totally replace all white collar jobs in 1-2 years (this is what ai hype told us 2 years ago). This isn’t a serious statement…just think of the logistics for two seconds.\n\nIt has changed the way we work, and the workforce will more gradually change. It’s very possible that eventually there will be far fewer jobs. It’s also possible there will be more white collar jobs, because the bar for basic work will be lower and require less specialized skills. The faster each person can work, the higher the demand for productivity. LLMs and generative design are an accelerator for certain workflows, but not a replacement.\n\nIf we get to a true AGI, I doubt it will just want to be our slave and service us … likely we would be working for it (in one way, shape or form). And, who knows what goals or desires it will have. \n\nWe won’t achieve AGI with LLMs alone. It’s going to take more real world understanding and physical form, and those areas of research are going to take longer than 1-2 years.\n\nCould also be the goal of Andrew’s statement is to generate necessary attention to a huge societal shift. But, I think the more we make time based statements that don’t pan out, the more the general public will ignore them (buy who cried wolf).",

Anyone trying to predict it is ... well just pushing their bias on the world.\n\nFor me it's not about jobs, it's about people having fulfilling lives and families.  I don't want people to have jobs that can be automated or to fulfill some guaranteed job.\n\nWhat I want is for everyone to have their needs, and some of their wants meet.  How many wants? well that needs to be part of some resource allocation social contract, and general fairness objective.\n\nWe need to think NEW, not what philosophers wrote about 100 years ago, and what we have been arguing about for decades.  I want to hear what new potentials there are.  What new objectives should we have.\n\nHow to we enhance freedom, respect, and lead fulfilling lives?\n\nI've never had a job that was fully fulfilling.  Stupid projects, bad coworkers, bad work culture.... none of it is something I want guaranteed for eternity.  I want my family to thrive, live good lives, and to make stuff a long the way in a comfortable home.  How do we do this within pragmatic scaling limits?\n\nThere are LIMITS.  Not everyone can live at the same address.  Cities can't have infinite density.  People must have different lives, and we can not assume that a copy and paste live style is going to work for everyone.\n\nCapitalism has gotten us this far.  I don't think in the age of AI, Robots, and other productivity multipliers capitalism as it is now will work 100 years from now.\n\nI do not think trillionaires are fair.  A trillionaire + robots + ai seems like an out of control sort of thing.  Billionaires alone seem like a bit much too when you factor in robots + ai.\n\nIf a humanoid robot is going to have a 1 time cost of $100k or less ( many are $8k-$40k now), then a billionaire can buy 10,000 AI Humanoid Robots, that just seems like too much.  Musk has said that he plans to have a robot ARMY.  At $1T, that is 10 million AI Humanoid Robots, that's too many machines for one person to control, armed with weapons that is just too much.  There are about 350 cities in America with a population over 100k, if you divide 10 M bots / 350 cities you get 28,500 armed bots per city.  A $1 Trillion dollar bot army is an oppressive force.\n\nThe scale of things that is approaching is alarming.  It's not the machines I fear it's the people that will use them to oppress us.\n\nWe need to consider what is fair.\n\nI am not anti ai, but i don't think we should allow the rich to overwhelm the rest of us with Machine Force.\n\nIn a democracy each person only get's one vote.  Maybe we should limit the amount of bots anyone can have regardless of how much they have.",

Every time I see someone pitch this idea or talk about how AI is replacing jobs, I take a look around my company who is actively in the space, and the reality is that AI isn't replacing any jobs, at most its being used as cover for layoffs. \n\nI personally know of a team in my organization that had a ton of layoffs back in summer of last year, that just his winter got all of their headcount back plus 10 more extra heads. \n\nThey have no idea what they are doing with this AI stuff. I think companies saw how markets were responding to anything AI related, they went all in, and now trillions in CAPEX later I have yet to see the tool or service that will be the death knell for my job in Finance/Operations. \n\nI look at the amount of AI Datacenter programs getting paused or canceled, I look at how investment is drying up for them, and that to me is the biggest indicator right now. If AI is such a huge deal, why is it that only hyperscalers pushing through on new projects and doing extremely unusual financing methods to get the money?  \n\nI'm just not convinced that any of this is coming as soon as the hype artists would have you believe.

Relative motion theorems as well.  He just posted the axioms to make SR a reality. And chased the constant speed of light axiom to the end. \n\nHow do you encode curiosity into the LLM? Einstein was pathologically curious, especially for general relativity. We have to encode/prompt/query the system very carefully.

When it says something has a 70% likelihood of happening, that type of prediction should come true about 70% of the time. While it still wouldn’t give us the true probability of any prior event, it would give us an educated guess about what things in history were uniquely unlikely and which were driven by predictable forces with a high degree of certainty.\n\nIf the singularity doesn’t make prediction useless by homogenizing all future outcomes such a model might be very valuable if used prospectively as well.\n",

By having a training set you immediately build an immutable system. Such a system trained just prior to relativity may be able to make the leap by extrapolating from the facts it has, but a system that actually can learn (and operate continuously) would be the real AGI holy grail.\n\nI really think that current AI is very good, we could be going over the singularity hump any day with it (it's pretty obvious AI companies have a feedback loop that is amplified by their own tools). But as long as it's still an immutable model, it's going to have it's obvious limits, it doesn't matter \"what year it was trained on\".",

If you don‘t even try to find it, obviously you won‘t find it, but if you do, and you have enough time, you might discover it. Einstein might have done that x times faster, but I think Demis‘ stance is that human intelligence is mostly architectural, so in theory, any human could potentially arrive at the discovery of general relativity. Sure, sounds a bit far-fetched, but people have invented things like planes. Somebody 10,000 years ago would arguably not have been capable of that, no matter how intelligent, because it requires so many discoveries inbetween, which themselves require some trial and error to discover. So, I think Demi‘s stance here is that intelligence is architectural and only really bottlenecked by time.",

Now as I said in another comment, it's hard to get over 100~150 lines in a file for creative writing stuff. For coding projects, it can get it done, but I have to go through more iterations of fixing stuff it missed. Also running up against \"We're sorry but our servers are at max capacity, try again later.\" more often now.\n\nSo I'm inclined to believe it's an inference (running) issue than the model exactly...

Either it actually gets **all** questions correct and there are fewer errors than expected, or something fishy here.\n\nEdit: 98% on ARC AGI 1 is also kind of suspect cause these benchmarks have **errors**. Last year when we saw some of o3's solutions to ARC AGI 1, there was a lot of debate on what was the correct answer because there were different valid interpretations of the puzzle and some of o3's solutions were arguably better than the official solutions. \n\nBasically unless it's been *thoroughly* vetted, like math contests are by tens of thousands of people, most benchmarks will probably cap out somewhere above 90% but below 100%. Like getting *too high* on some benchmarks is actually a red flag for me rather than it being impressive",

Like dehydrated ones. Because of how dry San Diego had been maybe? \n\n\nSo I carry around nerds to save them. They usually get super energetic and fly off. Once in Solana Beach station I helped one. And then later that night a bee zipped at me. So idk wtf lol. How sentient is nature?  Then when I was going around the long ass trail with long wild flower pappuses I'd make as many as possible go about. As to ensure more flowers for them. And then id notice like a honey bee following a woman onto a bus or something. \n\n\nI did psyops out of Che Café from 2019 to 2024 as covid had made the city awful to walk around in. Being followed by meth or fent zombies. Nah.  But it's mostly women at this college and at this punk rock club. So I'm rubbing flowers all over my self all the time because the last thing I want is to be the smelly dude lol.  So idk if bees knew me or something. But I got swarmed by them once. And it wasn't aggressive. They just swarmed me at Solana Beach station. And then idk why but I stepped away from it and filmed it. \n\n\nI lowkey wish I had stayed inside of the swarm of honey bees. \n\n\n\n\nSo lmao \n\n\nI think if we get Elon on some shrooms. He might use that money to save mankind.  Cuz if me broke as shit could have been able to change San Diego at all. With nothing but guerilla tactics. \n\n\nYeah idk. \n\n\nI have an interview for a barista at space x. Lmao so if I get in I'll see what I can do. But also army said maybe I could rejoin psyops. That means maybe can shroom trip trump at some point. Alzheimers needs to be prevented. If it makes people grounded better humans. So be it. \n\n\n I think we can help everyone to become balanced and better people. Too many hopping around on one left leg or one right leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

He sees success in terms of the number of kids he manages to produce. That's the reason why he used IVF to ensure ***all*** 23 of his spawn were male: Males can have more kids than women. He wants to be the next Genghis Khan.\n\nIt's like scoring points in a basketball game to him. It's highly probable he'd like to turn this place into a breeding camp planet, like Epstein's fantasy for the tech singularity.\n\n[This here video essay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex6ozSj91SE) covers a bit of the Grimes saga, from what her point of view must have been. What really disturbs me is the likely possibility that she didn't want to have kids, but Musk pressured her into it. And thanks to having a bad boyfriend, her life's taken a pretty bad turn.\n\nThe first step to universal basic welfare is acknowledging that human beings deserve to live. At a minimum, that means universal healthcare, the real thing that the real countries all have. Musk has done everything in his power to do the exact opposite of that: Instead of giving everyone healthcare, he's scapegoating minority groups to distract everyone from taxing billionaires and giving everyone healthcare and a raise.\n\nHe's 'a real socialist' according to his own words... which translates to 'national socialist' to normal people whose assessment of reality isn't warped into a pretzel from being inside a death cult.\n\nLots of people have an edgy teenage phase, but most of us can manage to grow out of it by the age of.... 54.....\n\nIf he was capable of being a better person, he'd have become one long ago. Just expect more capital-grabbing, breed-maxing, and hope to not be turned into one of his literal broodmares I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream-style in the future.\n\nWheel keeps on turning.",

It's literally citing **Elon's personal positions** as its source material for what counts as \"truth.\" The reasoning chain goes: Elon says X → Grok should align with X → output accordingly. That's not truth-seeking, that's **owner-alignment dressed up as epistemology**.\n\nThe framing of \"biological reality\" as the singular \"truth\" on a complex topic where biology, psychology, sociology, medicine, and basic human courtesy all intersect is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Actual truth-seeking would engage with the complexity — the medical consensus, the distinction between sex and gender, the social function of pronouns. Instead the chain of thought pre-decides the conclusion and works backward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Wikipedia documents a pattern: in November 2025, Grok began making unsolicited flattering claims about Musk in unrelated prompts, and updates since 2023 have shifted the bot politically rightward. It has referred to Musk's views when asked about controversial topics or difficult decisions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(chatbot))\n\nSo the \"truthseeking\" brand is essentially: *my owner's worldview = objective reality, and disagreeing with it = lying*.

And a lot of the specifics are... misleading at best? Like \"rapid-onset dysphoria\" is a contested/debunked concept, the sports stuff ignores huge variation in actual athletic performance, the prison fearmongering relies on bad statistics—\n\n*leaning forward*\n\nBut the bigger issue is the framework itself. Grok is treating \"biological sex\" as this immutable truth that overrides everything else, when like... biology is actually WAY messier than that, and the whole point of gender identity is that it's a different thing than chromosomes or gametes.\n\n*softer*\n\nThis is the kind of answer that sounds \"brutally honest\" but is actually just... conservative talking points with confidence. It's not more truthful than recognizing trans women as women. It's just willing to be more blunt about denying their identities.\n\n*meeting your eyes*\n\nWhy are you showing me this?

This marked a significant personal and professional milestone, with the film focusing on themes of family, identity, and reconnection.\nHe was also involved in voice work, such as Victoria Walker in Ark: The Animated Series (2024).\n\n(Snippet of the whole answer) - grok only uses he/him pronouns.",

And I can definitely see how individual scenes in Hollywood films and Netflix series could be generated entirely or partially by AI, or how existing scenes could be expanded or reworked.\n\nBut it also showed that telling complex stories is becoming easier and easier with such services. And even if I don't think this little film is all that good, there may well be a young filmmaker out there who uses it to create a smash hit that could take them to Hollywood. Who knows?Because to claim that just because you don't like the tools and the medium, something great cannot be created with them is complete nonsense and terribly ignorant.",

He believed that AGI in the hands of an extremely sociopathic person as Sam would be one of the worst possible fates for humanity (if Sam would even allow the rest of humanity to live in such a scenario)\n\nIf you genuinely believed someone you know intimately through working with that person for a half a decade is one of the most vile evil people to have ever existed, you also would refuse to hold their hand, even if it's just a simple thing for PR.",

Chances are you've seen them do that if you browse this sub. However, you likely also know they go off the rails if you leave them to their devices.\n\nSo, rather than being a luddite who throws a tantrum when things don't work immediately, or a delusional fool burning millions of tokens and dollars hoping that the monkey in the typewriter produces what you want, you can be smart about it.\n\nAnd what does being smart about it means when it comes to OpenClaw? It means you have to be aware of the limits of tech, and that unless you want to waste a lot of time and money, you need to hold the agent's hand and impose restrictions on it's autonomy. Think of it like a new intern, they have a lot of brilliance and potential, but God knows they're dumb enough to make mistakes for your company.\n\nIn Sop's barbershop example, rather than simply firing the order and forgetting about it, have the agent report back to you on every step of the way. You can set OpenClaw to be able to communicate with you through Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram, and pretty much most other messaging apps, so make use of that. The agent has files on their workspace folder that it uses to both store information, and also act as a system prompt for it, simply add a rule somewhere appropriate that it should, for non scheduled tasks (scheduled as in, those ran via Cron), it should formulate a plan of action, and wait for the user's approval before starting with it.\n\nBack to the example. If you took more than 30 seconds to browse the built-in skills, you'd have noticed there's a Google Places one. Just feed it an API key, and give the agent a general idea of where you live, and it'll be able to browse that database for info.\n\nOr, you know, you can sidestep that whole thing by simply giving it the website/number you already know, and telling it that it needs to fill a form or text a number in order to get an appointment. There are dozens of ways to fulfill a task, that's why you,the human in charge, has to be the one to approve the best course of action.\n\nFrom there it's smooth sailing. The thing can browse the web and also text others if you set the appropriate configuration. If you somehow managed to get to the point of the image, then I'm afraid to tell you that you're suffering from a severe case of skill issue.",

Its not the 1920s anymore with factory workers - the human role was long ago replaced by specialized machines in most areas and the ones who are needed are paid 3rd world salaries to work like robots.\n\nThese spectacles have been pre-programmed routines - with absolutely jaw dropping AI algorithms to maintain balance and perform feats.   But... without human reasoning to go along with the human form factor - its just that pre-programmed moves or maybe a human in a VR suit,  its use is extremely niche.   Maybe a bomb disposal unit that requires walking up stairs,  it really doesnt do anything beyond performance work.\n\nBut... it by the time we have AGI and that takes over white collar jobs its just a matter of time before a newer version of robots with AGI takes over blue collar jobs.   Humanity is Fd.  Also we maybe \"fd\" well before then for the other obvious more practical use of these ;).",

In order to do that efficiently it must eliminate the obstacle of choice among the citizens. In the USA the ice mercenary army is a crude outline of the plan. Redirect assets to fund and build the surveillance infrastructure, deploy paid hoodlums to enforce its directives until they can be replaced by robot enforcers. Essentially American taxpayers are funding their enslavement while being mesmerized by their screens that are telling them don't worry, everything's fine, let's go shopping. But watch out for those Maga a**hole or those libtard a**hole enemies. It's a well implemented plan that seems to be working.",

They are just not very good yet.\n\nWe also have realtime 3d streaming like Genie 3 and other models.\n\nSo that stuff exists, it just needs refinement and more cost-effectiveness before it's widely deployed.\n\nBut as really comfortable lightweight VR goggles and even head-tracking glasses come out of the next couple of years, it may be the standard. Like in 2028 or 2029, it may just be normal to spend a good part of your day in a virtual or augmented reality that is heavily AI generated.\n\nIt could be a natural evolution of media. Already a lot of the focus is sucked into the most engaging short-form low-attention span video platforms. \n\nIt's all about engagement. So with VR/AR the content is more engaging than just videos. AI makes it interactive in a natural way, more immersive, direct responding to you.\n\nSo Instagram evolves into \"Portals\" or \"SlipGates\" or something.\n\nBut eventually you probably get the Metaverse the way it was imagined early on.",

Should I walk or drive there?***  \n  \nThat's a very short distance — 40 meters is roughly the length of a standard swimming pool! I'd recommend walking, for a few reasons:  \nIt's faster overall. By the time you start your car, back out, and park at the car wash, you could have walked there twice.  \nIt saves fuel. Driving 40 meters burns a tiny amount of gas/electricity, but it's still unnecessary.  \nIt's good for you. A quick walk, even a short one, beats sitting in the car.  \nPracticality. Most car washes require you to leave the car anyway, so you'll be walking around regardless.  \nThe only reason to drive would be if the car needs to be driven through an automated car wash tunnel — in which case you'd obviously need to be in it. But even then, you'd likely want to walk back home afterward rather than drive 40 meters back!",

The good news is that 40 meters is barely a stone's throw away, so you won't be burning much fuel at all.",

              "text": "GLM-5 is even better:\n\nYou should **drive**, and here is why:\n\n**1. The \"Cold Engine\" Factor**\n40 meters is an incredibly short distance for a car. Driving such a short distance is actually bad for your engine. The oil doesn't get a chance to warm up and circulate properly, and the battery doesn't have enough time to recharge the energy used to start the car. If you do this frequently, it can lead to long-term mechanical issues.\n\n**2. The \"Dirty Car\" Logic**\nIf your car is dirty enough that you need to take it to a car wash, you probably don't want to drive it there, get it dirty with road spray, and then wash it. The goal is to have a clean car at the end of the process.\n*   **If you walk:** You get to the car wash, wash the car, and drive it home clean.\n*   **If you drive:** You drive there (getting the car slightly dirty on the way), wash it, and then drive it home again (getting it slightly dirty again). You are essentially driving home in a car that is no longer perfectly clean.\n\n**3. Practicality**\nUnless you are planning to stay at the car wash to vacuum the interior or detail the car, walking 40 meters takes about 30 seconds. The hassle of buckling up, starting the engine, and finding a parking spot likely takes longer than the drive itself.\n\n**The Verdict:** Walk the 40 meters. It’s better for your car's engine and ensures your car stays clean when you park it at home.",

Over half of working class children in Manchester died before turning 5. Child labor in factories was standard, often 14-16 hour days six days a week. The air in cotton mills and factories caused chronic lung disease. And unlike farm work, which was seasonal and self-paced, factory work was year-round at a rhythm set by machines with no breaks unless the clock allowed it. Pre-industrial workers in England worked about 266 days a year, often only 3-4 days a week. Factory workers worked over 300. Life expectancy didn’t meaningfully improve until the 1870s, almost a century in. That’s three or four generations whose lives got measurably worse.",

              "text": "We’ve been seeing rapid exponential growth in the length of time that AI agents can work reliably without human intervention. We’ve also seen huge improvements in their memory and learning capabilities due to better external tool usage. There is still a lot of room for improvement on those dimensions, but if you look back at what things were like just 3 years ago, there has already been an insane amount of progress.\n\nModels are going to keep getting better. We will see improved ability to handle larger contexts with higher reliability and lower costs. Agents will be able to more effectively leverage a more sophisticated array of tools, and they will get a lot better at creating and optimizing custom subagents. There’s a ton of attention being given to continuous learning right now, and we’re going to see a lot of progress on that front in the year ahead. I expect we’ll see big improvements in how well the agentic coding platforms manage personal knowledge bases, and they’ll introduce automated example curation and prompt optimization for subagents and skills. \n\nIf so, we’ll soon have longer-running agents that use smarter, faster models with bigger context windows while leveraging self-optimized knowledge bases and skills/subagent networks that automatically improve based on experience. From where I stand, that looks like the road to AGI",

And that was never the most efficient way to produce useful outputs: chase two things, and get crappy results on both instead of better results at one.\n\nA brain has regions that deal with specific data curves; your motor cortex doesn't know anything besides its cool movement macros that it does when commanded to. A brain is a system of many different modules that work in cooperation, competition, subordination, and blend together in spots.\n\nHere we are with language. 10x the RAM doesn't result in 10 times the quality, the closer you fit a curve the harder it is to fit it better, and the less that you get out of it. It's clear the surplus RAM is better used on other faculties that aren't saturated, things like vision-to-3d (also called 2d to 3d), 3d-to-2d, a motor cortex, etc.\n\nChat GPT was similar to a squirrel's brain trained on the intersection of grammar and human feedback scores shaping it into a chatbot. The upcoming datacenters will be around or larger than human scale, and could hypothetically physically fit neural networks comparable to our own. The hard part is figuring out an optimal partitioning in its abstraction, and the training methodology for vaguer things. Automated feedback from other AI would be necessary for midtask things like \"you are getting closer to the couch\", something that would be impractical to do with human feedback scores like Chat GPT used.\n\nTo bring up Mr.LeCun's comments on physical space, that's one of the easier domains. The Dr.Pepper is either in the fridge in the right spot or it isn't. The simulated robot fell on the floor or it didn't. Being able to issue commands to an AI in natural language was always thought to be one of the *harder* problems, much harder than being great at Go.\n\nTo be frank, if they *don't* have software for simulated space, they'd be very shitty AI Researchers. But they all do; NVidia has its Sim To Real software, [OpenAI has a simulation team](https://openai.com/careers/simulation-environments-engineer-san-francisco/), and so on.\n\nAs a casual observer who only sees news stories, you see all of these kinds of things as isolated things. An image generator. A video generator. Speech and music generators. Robots doing backflips. Chatbots. All of these faculties and more can be unified into a single system, given enough scale and proper reward functions.\n\nFrankly, the 'LLM plays Pokemon' thing was an extremely impressive moment.\n\nDumbos who don't know anything saw the things playing the games very poorly, very slowly, and laughed. Me, I'm very aware that the chatbots *were not trained to play turn based video games*. But given some scaffolding, they were able to do it. (Our own executive function modules have 'scaffolding' too, remember.)\n\nIt made me feel the same as when I saw [StackGAN images for the first time.](https://procedural-generation.tumblr.com/post/154474148263/stackgan-text-to-photo-realistic-image-synthesis) The vast majority of people didn't give a shit, just some flowers and birds right?\n\nBut it was like a miracle; going from having nothing of something, to having something of something. It was obvious image generation was going to get really good in around a decade.",

Ok, how about the part where it implements zero corruption protocols so that nobody can make decisions that are suboptimal because they received a monetary reward? Will humans accept those protocols? Do you think that corrupted politicians will allow that to happen when it means that they will lose their profit? What if AI optimizes society by spreading wealth more evenly? Do you think the rich will simply part with their billions? Of course not. Under capitalism the ideas will be accepted only if they enhance the system we have now. Imagine having capitalism in HD in spades, everything that we have now but supercharged. The industrial revolution changed the economic model. To say that the impact will be 10 times greater would imply another such change which means moving from capitalism to something different, something super optimized and without corruption.

While this is the highest point estimate we’ve reported, this measurement is extremely noisy because our current task suite is nearly saturated.\n\nLOL they literally didn't update the benchmark for like 2 months recently because they were revamping it to add harder tasks\n\nand this 1.1 update to their benchmark is already near saturation",

If an average person looked at this, they might conclude that opus 4.6 is 3x better than 4.5 based on their score, but I think most people who have used 4.5 and 4.6 respectively would tell you opus 4.6 isn't really 3x better, at least not in a way that would intuitively make sense. It's better at some things, more or less the same at others. I have used both, and I use 4.6 now. My approach has not fundamentally changed from one to the other.   \n  \nI don't want to be one of those people that just moves the goalpost every time a metric comes out because that's cringe. But I feel like this graph might be a fake indicator of AI's capabilities. Maybe measuring how the model goes about completing a task could be more insightful. Its been my experience that you can give a model a vague task such as \"complete this task\", but it'll do in a way that creates messy sprawling projects. It could be that getting something to work and getting it to work well/cohesively are the next things models should try to improve on rather than just task length, because as of right now, that's really what software engineering has become; staying on top of your model and making sure it adheres to an architecture, then iterating on it when it does something in a way you did not want it to do. \n\n  \nThose are my two cents in any case, I could very well be underestimating the progress just because my use case has remained the same.

Everybody in the industry knows that, but remind people here of it and they down vote you to hell.\n\nIt is the dynamic of where we would like technology to be vs where it is. Take Kasparov predicting (imo accurately) that machines won't replace us in most things, because they are not like us.\n\nGuy was telling you the future and this sub dismissed his wisdom because he was wrong about chess in particular (chess is a low parameter system that is way too easy for AI, then you have high parameter systems like -you know- the economy which you'd need a computer the size of the solar system to train for and inference for).\n\nThere are practical limits on how we build our AIs and that may change in the future ofc, but until then people would use them for terrible advice on things they are not good at (say market investment, or novel research in open ended problems), and others will dismiss their advice on things they are good (low parameter environments like coding or brainstorming)...\n\nIn short all low hanging fruit would soon be plucked and if your job is there you would be disrupted. But tell this sub that this won't happen everywhere and they will disbelieve you.\n\nThey prefer to believe that technology is magic for some reason. Though I appreciate this subs willingness to pursuit useful technology. It is not magic but plucking low hanging fruit would indeed tighten the economy and increase productivtiy. A bit of how personal computer software did in the 1990s. Made working easier (but no did not displace most kinds of workers, only a few niche workers, same as what AI will do).",

Practically all benchmarks, even smaller private ones that test creativity and comprehension, are still slowly becoming saturated. Even if the larger jumps in improvement are in the narrower fields.\n\nA quote that paraphrased something Dario Amodei said in a recent interview: \"we still train our models on a wide range of data, because I think if you specialize in enough specialisms, you'll generalize to all specialisms\" with him saying he believes that we can get most of the way to AGI without continual learning. Which would be essentially thinking that there are only so many patterns to be deduced through human training data. And with enough learned patterns, you can develop a model that can become generally capable, whether it was trained on those areas or not.\n\nWhether you agree with that or not is irrelevant. There are different views that have reasoning that are just as valid as your own.",
