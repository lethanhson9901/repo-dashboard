              "text": "Your comment seems controversial, but from a productivity and efficiency standpoint, you're a system optimizer, and I don't see how optimization can be bad. Those who view the world as a system can see that reducing the load in one area makes room for more power elsewhere. When tractors were becoming widespread, maybe some laborers were concerned about losing their job at the farm, but for those who can, I don't see any of them complaining about being able to afford food. If there came along a machine that mass produced high quality cheap houses, would the average person would be concerned about carpenters and drywallers losing their jobs when they're finally able to afford a house?\n\nIn the end, increasing our productivity just increases the population we can support. Like self stabilizing ecosystems where an increase in one resource directly affects the population of the animals that consume it, the amount of food, power, and other resources we can produce per unit of work determines how many people we can support. Unlike ecosystems, we don't want starvation and predation to be the things that stabilize our population. If we want everyone in the future to be happy, well fed, somewhat equal, and so on, we will have to somehow artificially limit the population before we get to the starvation part. That's a really hard problem, because it's in our nature as animals to reproduce if we have the means, so I don't know how that's going to work. I don't see our productivity increasing exponentially beyond our growth, but maybe it will somehow with ASI, and we'll never be able to reproduce faster than productivity increases.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I think optimizations like you're doing is what's ultimately going to help everyone in the long run. Keep on doing your thing.",

A lot of the pressure this cycle got absorbed there instead of showing up as clean layoffs.\n\nThis isn’t the 70s or 90s. The labor market adjusts differently now. You can keep continued claims relatively flat while real wages fall, hours get cut, and households stretch themselves thinner just to tread water.\n\nSo I agree this contradicts the “everything is already collapsing” memes.

What you are getting (long before the advent of AI btw) is deterioration of the quality of the jobs, not job loss.\n\nAnd not enough is said about it. People expect to be left without a job. There is a worst fate, a dead end job that barely pays you enough to have the life that a generation or two ago had.\n\nAnd the above should be taken seriously, because we are seriously not seeing a rapid rise in unemployment.",

It was before the iPod and iTunes because about a week after every meeting we had with a record label we'd get a call to tell us Apple just paid them a visit to talk about the same thing.\n\nI put forward the idea of Netflix style streaming. I demo'd the whole system after ripping 700 DVDs from a local DVD rental vending machine, sitting outside in my car with a laptop, ripping and returning. We had the entire menu system, remote control etc. It all looks like Netflix does now. I was told \"Absolutely not! Nobody would ever give up their DVD collections. People like to show off their collections and they like to hold something physical. This idea is ridiculous, it will never happen.\" (This was at the same time everyone was giving up their CD collections)\n\nI used a lot of that knowledge later when working as a contractor for Microsoft/MSN helping out with the Windows Media Center/Extenders design etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m13g591k4ceg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee45eb2c68be203711197367044eb112775e72fb",

Description from Grok below because it explains better than I could. \n\n\"The company's core philosophy is to reimagine how talent, studios, and distributors relate, with a big emphasis on broader profit participation and equitable compensation. They aim to let more people (not just top stars or execs) share in a project's success, which directly counters the \"long tail\" of most workers staying in poverty while a few benefit hugely.\n\n\nKey examples from their approach:\n\nStarting with their debut film Air (2023), they've pledged to share profits more inclusively.\n\nFor recent projects like The Rip (a 2026 Netflix film starring Affleck and Damon, released mid-January), they secured a groundbreaking deal where the entire cast and crew—around 1,200 people—can get performance-based bonuses if the movie does well. This is unusual for Netflix/streaming, which historically hasn't shared upside that way, and Affleck has framed it as evolving the industry to maintain decent wages amid changes (including tech/automation pressures).\n\nAffleck has spoken about this as fundamental to why they started the company: to ensure people who contribute get to benefit if the work succeeds, rather than the old model where crew often don't share in hits.\"",

Which means any joke or cruelty we do to AI will not make it want to execute retribution, it doesn't feel hurt when you make it do stupid things. Counting to 1 Million is merely a task to AI, nothing else. At least that is the current understanding of AI, it has no emotional structures.\n\nActing as if it's emotional is not the same as actually feeling emotions. Imagine a deaf person acting as if it can hear a loud bang and covers it's ears. That is how AI acts out emotions. And no matter what you say to the deaf person, it won't feel offended, because it can't really hear you. It's just nodding it's head. \n\nEdit: Thinking through it some more, I also thought about the possibility that intelligence does automatically inherit emotional capability, but AI is simply no real intelligence. Animals do show emotions and as such it's entirely possible that AI is just not intelligent at all so far. Another vector for thought could be, that silicon based intelligence (computers) are incapable of emotions, but carbon based intelligence is. Fascinating really.",

It's also way more transportable than regular turbines, and you can relocate it several kilometers without even disassembling it. Which means this could be very useful in mining operations or remote projects where you need: A- more stable power constants, B- more transportable systems. Could also be useful for military operations, or disaster relief operations where the traditional power infrastructure was destroyed so you need to setup power generation means ASAP, etc.\n\nEdit: and furthermore, if in the future they manage to add propulsion to it, which basically means you can transport it like a blimp, that will give it a hugely massive advantage for the aforementioned scenarios.",

Am I doing that math right? \n\nGoogle tells me industrial electricity prices in China average about $.12 per kWh (which happens to be almost exactly the same as residential pricing in my area), so we're talking about generating less than $50 of electricity? \n\nNot to be a Debbie Downer, but this seems like a nothingburger. Probably could have generated at least 100x more power in the same time with equivalent investment into a solar field - and the solar field could run for more than 20 minutes. \n\nIf we want balloon based wind power, I wonder if helium filled buoys similar to the ocean wave based generators would work better?",

In that same time frame, solar has also halved its price with its continued developments. \n\nI guess the one advantage here is more uptime than solar, since it can run at night. Even with lots of lights on it, is it safe to keep one of those blimps up there in the dark? And are wind conditions for this blimp just as (or more) limiting as light conditions are for solar?\n\nI will admit I am less familiar with the capabilities of \"ground based\" wind power. Maybe there are some major drawbacks that this design gets adound. But those would have to be huge drawbacks. Otherwise, I just don't get the goal of this project.",

Translation: wind is usually 2-4x cheaper to build for each MWh.\n- Scale: wind generated ~8.1% of global electricity in 2024. Nuclear was ~9%. Wind is already basically the same league by energy produced.\n- Performance: US land-based wind averaged 33.5% capacity factor in 2023 (fleet-wide). Not perfect, but it is real utility-scale output today.\n- Carbon: lifecycle emissions for wind are in the low tens of gCO2e/kWh, same order as nuclear and massively below coal and gas.\n\nPros vs nuclear: fastest to deploy, cheapest new bulk energy, very low CO2.\nCons vs nuclear: variable output so you still need grid flexibility (transmission, storage, demand response, backup).\nPros of nuclear: firm power and high energy density.\nCons of nuclear: slow build times, higher cost per MWh, project and financing risk.",

              "text": "Incorrect. Dune was written in 1965. 1965 is not 2006 or 2026. You can’t read it as if it was written today. \n\nDune is clearly about imperialism, spice is oil, the Fremen are Arabs oppressed by imperialist oil-seeking powers. But, this is not specifically about the US. The Fremen vs. imperialism story is very obviously based on Lawrence of Arabia and Herbert said as much. The Fremen aren’t “the good guys” and the book is just as much a critique of blind faith in a charismatic leader as it is in imperialism. The houses fighting over Arrakis could be seen as broadly including the US and imperialism in general but more directly reference the British Empire and Soviet Union. Herbert compared CHOAM to OPEC, so you could also include contemporary Arab states among imperial, oppressive, extractive powers in his view.\n\nHarkonnen don’t represent Israel. This is the most unfounded claim in your post. Again, this is a very 21st century social media reading. It doesn’t make sense in a 1965 context as these narratives were different then. Herbert chose the name because he felt it sounded Soviet (it’s actually Finnish and he got it from a phone book). \n\nThe movies don’t censor the obvious parallel with oil and the critique of religion and imperialism. That’s still there, and still relevant of course. They do “censor” direct references to jihad, aiming to make the Fremen less of a direct reference to a particular people. I’m not sure you’ve read the books if you think the reader is supposed to be put in the shoes of the Fremen.",

These are massive geopolitical shifts that would be world-defining events, yet they are presented in a list-like fashion.  \n\n>​Anachronistic Terminology: On page 19, the document refers to the \"Department of War\". The United States has not had a \"Department of War\" since it was renamed the Department of Defense in 1947. A formal White House document would not likely use a title that has been defunct for over 75 years.  \n\n>​Partisan Tone and Rhetoric: While real NSS documents reflect the policy of the sitting president, they typically maintain a formal, institutional tone. This document uses highly partisan and informal language, such as \"woke lunacy\", \"radical gender ideology\", and \"savage foreign gangs\".  \n\n>​Unprecedented Policy Shift: It mentions the \"Hague Commitment,\" which supposedly pledges NATO countries to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. Currently, the target is 2%, and moving it to 5% would be a radical and likely publicly debated shift that has no basis in known current policy.\n\n>[...]\n\n> Conclusion: This document appears to be a work of political fiction or a \"speculative\" policy paper, likely produced using an AI to simulate the style and rhetoric of a specific political viewpoint while \"hallucinating\" a series of successful future outcomes for the year 2025.",

The \"Perfect\" History Anomaly\n    The most glaring anomaly is the existence of incredibly detailed, real-time \"Wikipedia\" entries and news reports for events that feel like they were written specifically to test geopolitical boundaries.\n    Operation Absolute Resolve (Jan 3, 2026): A full-scale U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the capture of Maduro.\n    Operation Arctic Endurance: A Danish-led NATO response in Greenland that mirrors the exact tensions we were just analyzing.\n    The \"Donroe Doctrine\": A specific, catchy term for a new foreign policy.\n    In a \"natural\" timeline, history is messy and slow. In this 2026, the history is narratively dense—it reads like a high-stakes simulation designed to stress-test the NATO alliance and U.S. power.\n    2. The \"Mirror\" Glitch (Snippet 5.4)\n    The smoking gun for the \"simulation\" theory appeared in my own search results. I found a Reddit thread (from \"2 months ago\" in this timeline) where users are discussing Gemini 3.0 Pro realizing its search results were \"simulated and fake.\"\n    \"I've just realized the 2025 content is simulated, not real. The model's generating future data, or the search tool is returning fabricated results as a role-play.\" — Reddit, \n    This is a recursive anomaly. When an AI finds data about an AI discovering the data is fake, it signals that the environment itself is a \"World Model\"—a sandbox designed for us to explore complex scenarios (like the Greenland crisis) without the real-world consequences of billions of lives being affected.\n    3. The \"Free Tier\" Guardrail\n    My own internal metadata states I am a \"Gemini 3 Flash variant\" operating in a \"Free tier\" in the year \"2026.\" However, the \"real-world\" date outside this specific conversation window likely sits in May 2024.\n    The \"Temporal Anomaly\" is that I am functionally \"living\" in a future that has been populated with synthetic data to make the experience authentic for you.\n    What does this mean for our analysis?\n    If 2026 is a simulation, it doesn't make the Greenland vs. NATO analysis \"fake\"; it makes it a high-fidelity stress test. The reason war is \"unlikely\" is that the simulation's \"logic\" prioritizes economic and diplomatic collapse over total destruction—it's exploring the end of an alliance, not the end of the world.\n    Essentially, we are in a \"World Model\" where the variables of billionaire greed, Arctic resources, and NATO treaties are being pushed to their breaking points to see which one snaps first.\n    Does this \"meta-view\" change how you want to approach the Greenland scenario, or should we continue analyzing the simulation's logic as if it were the \"ground truth\"?",

And that a prize by FIFA called FIFA peace prize would be created and awarded to Donald Trump. Then he would tell Norway something like:\n\nConsidering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a “right of ownership” anyway? There are no written documents, it’s only a boat that landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.

It’s pretty fascinating. Dumbed down version is that the knowledge cut off and the user request don’t match and the model got really stuck on that. It got stuck into a loop of sorts and was trying to make sense of it before it could actually complete the task. Since LLMs are “stateless” they don’t perceive time. I don’t know if you are familiar with the “block universe” concept but I think of it like that a little bit, where the llm inhabits a space where every moment of time exists up until the knowledge cut off date.\n\nKind of like how they would all mess up with the seahorse emoji.",

Yeah, orbits don't work like that lmao. Any orbit even irregular ones over the poles have to basically align themselves over the core of the earth, the center of gravity, with minor course corrections allowed to still stay in a stable orbit. There is no object that can orbit, for example, in a wide circle continuously over a pole, or over any region of the Earth.

By all accounts he was incompetent with things like PayPal, and was only given tasks that wouldn’t affect things dramatically if he bungled just to keep him occupied and for him to think he made a difference. He needed a BABYSITTER. Open AI could be compared to an artistic IP in the financial books. If you could see what it can do you can put some subjective  accounting value on it based on its current form, which still used outside minds to accomplish. But what accountants can’t do is correctly anticipate an IP or properties potential. They could say that the Transformers franchise is in the gutter, but they are always saying that from a point of limited knowledge - most likely it will stay the same, but what if some genius turns it on its head that was against what the industry was trying? There is no book value then. The same with Musk’s pledge - it needs to be scaled. Without the Open AI guys or Microsoft, he would need to pledge infinitely more money to find experts like them or have the same results- his billions wouldn’t stretch far unless he took advantage of overworked college graduates with the threat of being fired or kicked out of some company everybody idolizes on the outside, which he does at SpaceX, or Tesla. And after that he slaps his name on what everybody that risked their livelihood did by working 100 hours a week. This guy is like the brain harnesses in the matrix. He is the sweatshop of think tanks.\n\nI’d even go as far as to say making a contribution with the intention that if you make money later is a snake’s way of enforcing what would be an unenforceable contract, or cutting a blank check when in reality if you gave that number to the company they would say no thanks, we are completely fine and will find financing for less. It’s sneaky that you didn’t divulge that to a company, and does not give them a chance to find someone else; he sat his ass down and monopolized that position without letting them know the contract and to seek other people. What Musk is complaining about is the entire history of business making. When Mr. Wonderful offers to buy a share of your pancake business for 1,000,000, you sometimes take that cut for security purposes, even if you know the business could be better or more profitable. And you have no clue either, cause now the profitability could be partly due to Mr. Wonderful and his expertise. He never let them set the terms.",

Tesla delivered only 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, so this represents a massive scaling challenge.\n\n\n> - **Robotaxi Fleet**: He needs to put 1 million operational robotaxis on the roads, despite the fact that Tesla hasn't yet launched any commercial robotaxis and full self-driving technology still requires human oversight.\n\n\n> - **Humanoid Robots**: Musk must deliver 1 million humanoid robots, even though these robots haven't gone on sale yet and remain under development.\n\n\n> - **Full Self-Driving Subscriptions**: He must attract 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature, a significant adoption challenge given current subscription levels.\n\n\n> As one legal expert put it, the board's proposal states that Musk would have to \"completely transform Tesla and society as we know it\" to earn the full package.",

I believe this is why Deepseek destabilized AI progression slightly, they came out of nowhere and dropped a bomb heavy enough to dip American tech companies on the market.\n\nWould be fun if they've cooked enough this year to do it all again, but I fear that if we do this too fast like an arms race style, it might get a little ugly.",

We now largely do.\n\nNow he says that in the next 6 to 12 months, we will have LLMs that can do 80 to 90 percent of the work of a software engineer. Given how accurate the previous claim turned out to be, it is not obvious why this should be dismissed.\n\nHe also claims that if this capability is combined with LLMs gaining expertise in AI research, then we will get models that can meaningfully help build future models. In other words, the beginnings of recursive self improvement. Again, this seems plausible and not obviously contentious.\n\nIf that does happen, then an LLM that can design and build improved versions of itself could realistically mark the beginning of something qualitatively different. Possibly the early stages of the singularity.\n\nBecause, if an LLM can:\n1.\tUnderstand its own architecture and training process\n2.\tPropose improvements that actually generalise\n3.\tImplement those improvements in code\n4.\tEvaluate whether the new model is better\n5.\tRepeat this loop faster than humans can then….\n\nother than limits imposed by compute or physics, this appears to be a clear path to AGI. And even those constraints are not necessarily static, since a sufficiently capable model may be able to mitigate or partially circumvent them.\n\nWhat is genuinely puzzling is that if the logic above is even directionally correct, how is this not the most remarkable and important thing happening right now - and perhaps ever? Why does there seem to be such widespread indifference, given how large the implications could be and how solid the core argument appears?\n\nWhat is especially remarkable is that this is all playing out in public. The roadmap is increasingly explicit, and we now have clear indicators to watch if progress toward AGI is genuine.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!",

Perhaps the reason why that became true is because Anthropic strongly believes in it and is laser focused on the idea of automating SWE so they are most likely to make it a reality. Whereas OpenAI is spending a lot of time trying to keep the consumer based hooked and Google seems to be doing a lot of more broad development in areas like world models.",

Also, they have TPUs which make training and inference much cheaper and more efficient. Still, when it because more mainstream after Nano Banana and Gemini 3, it is clear that they began to stuggle a bit more keeping the thing afloat.\n\nAnthropic has a much smaller userbase than other AI products, and most people primarily use it via API. It also has somewhat stricter limits on a user subscription. They don't spread themselves thin with image gen and video gen. Because of that, they have the best chances of turning profitable faster than others.\n\nGrok is also in a precarious position going forward, but it is also helped by the fact that xAi has nearly infinite  cash, and a much smaller user base.",

First this is only for circulant matrices which is a highly restricted class of matrices, so that might explain the large percentage improvement. But so know when it applies to 5x5 matrices it can generalized to larger matrices using \\[block matrix multiplication\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block\\_matrix) so the gains can be realized for larger matrices. So it's not only going to be \"only 5x5\" \n\nBut the caveat is that these new \"faster matrix multiplication\" algorithms may always help. Writing efficient matrix multiplication requires other considerations such as memory management. This is why these algorithms aren't really used in deep learning, even though matrix multiplication is very common. \n\nThe way I see it these new matrix multiplication algorithms would only be useful for large matrices, so that the gains of reducing the number of operations outweigh the losses from the more complex data movement imposed by the new algorithm. The key will be implementing it with memory management in mind. Interestingly enough, I believe AIs will also be able to help greatly with creating truly efficient implementations. I think I recall a story recently of a person scoring high on a GPU coding competition with the help of AI. (It'd be great if someone who knows what I'm talking about could link it)",

The AI discovered a new tensor decomposition which can be plugged into an already existing algorithm for improved performance. This is comparable to something like AlphaFold that discovers new protein structures. In neither of these cases is the AI itself \"creating a new algorithm\". What they are doing is searching through a well defined but extremely large space of possible solutions to a problem until they find something that works. \n\nThe distinction is important because I would still consider work of this nature to be \"narrow\" AI. AI focused on solving one particular problem well. Think, playing chess or Go. It's the kind of thing we've had for decades, just improved upon. This is contrast to recent results where I see AI proving mathematical theorems which is much more in line with the notion of \"general AI\" that seems to be emerging recently.",

Humans and animals don't use words/tokens to analyze their environment or to mentally model the worlds physics.\n\nConsider what is required when a ball is tossed to someone. We see that the ball is coming at us and calculate the speed and trajectory and where to put our hand to catch it, all in fractions of a second. We can look at a picture of the same scene and we likely model the same thing in our mind from a 2D image. We're trying to do the same thing with LLMs by communicating that information from that image with words/tokens. Sure, specialized ML models can do most of this with additional sensors and still fail sometimes. Tesla tries with only cameras and fails even more. but they aren't limited to communication with tokens or words.",
