              "text": "Your comment seems controversial, but from a productivity and efficiency standpoint, you're a system optimizer, and I don't see how optimization can be bad. Those who view the world as a system can see that reducing the load in one area makes room for more power elsewhere. When tractors were becoming widespread, maybe some laborers were concerned about losing their job at the farm, but for those who can, I don't see any of them complaining about being able to afford food. If there came along a machine that mass produced high quality cheap houses, would the average person would be concerned about carpenters and drywallers losing their jobs when they're finally able to afford a house?\n\nIn the end, increasing our productivity just increases the population we can support. Like self stabilizing ecosystems where an increase in one resource directly affects the population of the animals that consume it, the amount of food, power, and other resources we can produce per unit of work determines how many people we can support. Unlike ecosystems, we don't want starvation and predation to be the things that stabilize our population. If we want everyone in the future to be happy, well fed, somewhat equal, and so on, we will have to somehow artificially limit the population before we get to the starvation part. That's a really hard problem, because it's in our nature as animals to reproduce if we have the means, so I don't know how that's going to work. I don't see our productivity increasing exponentially beyond our growth, but maybe it will somehow with ASI, and we'll never be able to reproduce faster than productivity increases.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I think optimizations like you're doing is what's ultimately going to help everyone in the long run. Keep on doing your thing.",

A lot of the pressure this cycle got absorbed there instead of showing up as clean layoffs.\n\nThis isn’t the 70s or 90s. The labor market adjusts differently now. You can keep continued claims relatively flat while real wages fall, hours get cut, and households stretch themselves thinner just to tread water.\n\nSo I agree this contradicts the “everything is already collapsing” memes.

What you are getting (long before the advent of AI btw) is deterioration of the quality of the jobs, not job loss.\n\nAnd not enough is said about it. People expect to be left without a job. There is a worst fate, a dead end job that barely pays you enough to have the life that a generation or two ago had.\n\nAnd the above should be taken seriously, because we are seriously not seeing a rapid rise in unemployment.",

It was before the iPod and iTunes because about a week after every meeting we had with a record label we'd get a call to tell us Apple just paid them a visit to talk about the same thing.\n\nI put forward the idea of Netflix style streaming. I demo'd the whole system after ripping 700 DVDs from a local DVD rental vending machine, sitting outside in my car with a laptop, ripping and returning. We had the entire menu system, remote control etc. It all looks like Netflix does now. I was told \"Absolutely not! Nobody would ever give up their DVD collections. People like to show off their collections and they like to hold something physical. This idea is ridiculous, it will never happen.\" (This was at the same time everyone was giving up their CD collections)\n\nI used a lot of that knowledge later when working as a contractor for Microsoft/MSN helping out with the Windows Media Center/Extenders design etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m13g591k4ceg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee45eb2c68be203711197367044eb112775e72fb",

Description from Grok below because it explains better than I could. \n\n\"The company's core philosophy is to reimagine how talent, studios, and distributors relate, with a big emphasis on broader profit participation and equitable compensation. They aim to let more people (not just top stars or execs) share in a project's success, which directly counters the \"long tail\" of most workers staying in poverty while a few benefit hugely.\n\n\nKey examples from their approach:\n\nStarting with their debut film Air (2023), they've pledged to share profits more inclusively.\n\nFor recent projects like The Rip (a 2026 Netflix film starring Affleck and Damon, released mid-January), they secured a groundbreaking deal where the entire cast and crew—around 1,200 people—can get performance-based bonuses if the movie does well. This is unusual for Netflix/streaming, which historically hasn't shared upside that way, and Affleck has framed it as evolving the industry to maintain decent wages amid changes (including tech/automation pressures).\n\nAffleck has spoken about this as fundamental to why they started the company: to ensure people who contribute get to benefit if the work succeeds, rather than the old model where crew often don't share in hits.\"",

That’s why the fix is process, not \"AI code is instant tech debt.\" Process could be like: test-first where possible, observability, static analysis, and requiring the model to explain tradeoffs and link changes to requirements.\n\nAlso, if the codebase is “AI-native” (typed, linted, consistent, high test coverage), it becomes easier for both humans and AI to maintain. Yeah, it can become debt fast, but that's simply in the hands of the wrong people. In the right hands, it can become incredibly valuable if you treat it like a junior engineer that types at 10x speed, not some omnipotent SWE. \n\nThe funny part is humans can create the same kind of tech debt, they’re just slower at producing it. I’ve seen plenty of spaghetti code written entirely by people. The differentiator isn’t “AI vs human,\" it’s whether you have processes like specs and tests; without those, anyone can ship tech debt; with them, AI just makes the good process a lot faster.\n\nI dislike appealing to authority, but according to Boris Cherny (who created Claude Code), they’re writing Claude Code using Claude Code. That only works because the process is rigorous.",

And then if it works, does it matter? \n\n\nDon't get me wrong I'm a stickler for good code too - and prefer things to be DRY as possible. The inefficient code AI generates aches my little developer heart. But if it works and if noone but an AI would need to maintain it, what does it matter (besides the tremendous amount of energy input).\n\n\nIf a bug happens in a forest but there is no developer around to hear it, does it make a sound?\n\nI think the remarkable point here is the scale at which they've made progress. I would not yet have expected this amount of working code/features being built autonomously to go anywhere this well. it's likely a giant pile of slop, but somehow it's managed to make things this size work together, demonstrating it likely had a large amount of bugs to resolve by itself in the process.\n\nI've always been with the assumption that enterprise level software development will be safe from AI disruption for a long time, in part, thanks to limitation of context window size and business critical elements that need clear observability.

However, there are some major issues with TTC, first it is very expensive, and two past a certain point it stops working and can actually become failure prone. This might actually be why they didn't let the browser finish because they knew if it went on longer it might regress. Though I change my opinion all the time, I was sure it was over when they hit the scaling ceiling then they figured out TTC. So it is 100% possible they might figure out better methods than TTC.\n\nOr maybe when all the developers accept their demise, and we finally admit to having a good run, we can't figure out how to get any further and we end up like this giraffe: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOlOyV7OkwY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOlOyV7OkwY)",

We'll still have *things to do* to keep us occupied, and perhaps we'll still be *compensated* for that, but will they be **jobs**???\n\nIf you told a farmer from 300 years ago that our work is to make spreadsheets on a computer, then they would have said that that isn't a \"real job\".

There are plenty of people right now who \"don't get it\", and think streaming \"isn't a real job\". \n\nWill we call what we do in the future a \"job\"? Because I think what's going to happen and what Altman has implied over several interviews is that there's going to be a merging of hobbies and jobs. In fact with the comparison with streaming, it may simply be a continuation of what's already going on in the last decade. There will be things to keep us occupied that we will be compensated for, but they may be more like games than jobs.

This tells me it is now possible to scale up 10x or more. But there is one important difference - the Cursor Browser project was based on excellent docs (web standards) and had Chrome as a target for comparison, a normal project is not well thought out from the start or have a reference implementation, so you need to manually test or supervise agent writing tests.\n\nIn the last month I saw a number of people showing how they organize their work with coding agents. The elements they had in common were 1. very careful preparation of specs and requirements, and 2. extensive testing, about 2..3x more LOC in tests than code itself. Specs and tests. This is the mantra.\n\nDivision of work - you have a Planner agent, a Coding agent and a Judge agent (code review). They work in a loop, planner looks at specs and test results, produces instructions for the Coding agent, which implements code and tests. Then the judge agent reviews the code and tests. This can be parallelized if you have a CLI tool to manage specs, plans and tests.\n\nIt's really fascinating, the whole process of writing software is changing in a couple of months more than in decades.",

What usually happens is that you get stuck with a code base that no-body understands and with several small errors that compound to the point where you can't vibe code yourself out of it.

However, Omegle.com shut down in November 2023 and is now replaced with Ome.tv. How can a dude who blew up in 2025 still be impressing girls on a site that shut down in 2023?\n\nThe clip at 5:57 was also clearly cut from one of Spanish streamer Kostyxd's old Omegle streams on YouTube. Kostyxd added Spanish subtitles to all of his old streams since his viewers were mostly from Spain at the time. Why else would this fake influencer randomly add Spanish subtitles to a conversation he's having in English, and only for this one clip out of all the clips he posted in that video? Clearly a stolen video and fake identity.",

At some point in their adult life this often becomes a problem but at that stage it's super hard to change something about it.\n\n\nOn the plus side if you have good character you'll likely have a much richer life. And getting fit and healthy not only transforms your body but also your face and overall looks: most people can improve 2-3 points if they invest in their health which also ups self-esteem which in return ups looks. If you're a 4 now you can become a 6 or even 7. And you'll appreciate it much more than someone who's born a 7 and likely won't be bound by looks.\n\nThis can btw also be observed when it comes to brains: smart people often have above average (top 10%) but not top tier (top 1%) income because they reach a 'good enough' level without much effort.\nSuccessful opportunists often are not the smartest people. Above average but not top causes you to take bigger risks more often, which at some point pays off eventually.\n\nPopular media renders all of this unfair. Truth is: most of us have a chance to have a good, fulfilling life. But you have to live the life that works best for you and not chase the life you see others have. I guess that's what religion often calls 'fate', and imo there's a grain of truth in it.",

These people are not qualified to influence anyone or anything. \n Buddha said \" anyone who says they're the Buddha isn't the Buddha\". \n I'm not saying that influencers make the claim that they're the Buddha but they absolutely insinuate that their world view is qualified enough to influence you to think as they do. \n\n Never is that the case. You will go down in flames at some point if you follow all but 0.5 of people in this world. Which is unlikely. Educate yourself daily. Use critical thinking. Abandon influencer culture completely.",

Which means any joke or cruelty we do to AI will not make it want to execute retribution, it doesn't feel hurt when you make it do stupid things. Counting to 1 Million is merely a task to AI, nothing else. At least that is the current understanding of AI, it has no emotional structures.\n\nActing as if it's emotional is not the same as actually feeling emotions. Imagine a deaf person acting as if it can hear a loud bang and covers it's ears. That is how AI acts out emotions. And no matter what you say to the deaf person, it won't feel offended, because it can't really hear you. It's just nodding it's head. \n\nEdit: Thinking through it some more, I also thought about the possibility that intelligence does automatically inherit emotional capability, but AI is simply no real intelligence. Animals do show emotions and as such it's entirely possible that AI is just not intelligent at all so far. Another vector for thought could be, that silicon based intelligence (computers) are incapable of emotions, but carbon based intelligence is. Fascinating really.",

Luckily our entire industry landed on an equilibrium of not using it. \n\nWe built our own system of terms for distributing source and licensing for commercial vs noncommercial use, and that's it. Patents are not a factor.\n\nThe only reason google filed any patents was so that no one could sue them. This was explicit internally. There was a bonus to file a patent in general, but there was no incentive at all to patent things related to your actual work. No one cared if what we actually did was patented. They cared that we covered as much ground as possible so that we would always be able to sue anyone who sued us first.\n\nThis was the best possible outcome with software patents. If people actually proactively used software patents there would be no internet and no tech industry at all. Building anything with software, even for personal use, would have been, for all intents and purposes, illegal since the 90s.\n\nIt did, however, create a kind of time bomb. If one of these businesses were to die, those patents would be worth a fortune to patent trolls.",

Which means this could be very useful in mining operations or remote projects where you need: A- more stable power constants, B- more transportable systems. Could also be useful for military operations, or disaster relief operations where the traditional power infrastructure was destroyed so you need to setup power generation means ASAP, etc.\n\nEdit: and furthermore, if in the future they manage to add propulsion to it, which basically means you can transport it like a blimp, that will give it a hugely massive advantage for the aforementioned scenarios.",

Translation: wind is usually 2-4x cheaper to build for each MWh.\n- Scale: wind generated ~8.1% of global electricity in 2024. Nuclear was ~9%. Wind is already basically the same league by energy produced.\n- Performance: US land-based wind averaged 33.5% capacity factor in 2023 (fleet-wide). Not perfect, but it is real utility-scale output today.\n- Carbon: lifecycle emissions for wind are in the low tens of gCO2e/kWh, same order as nuclear and massively below coal and gas.\n\nPros vs nuclear: fastest to deploy, cheapest new bulk energy, very low CO2.\nCons vs nuclear: variable output so you still need grid flexibility (transmission, storage, demand response, backup).\nPros of nuclear: firm power and high energy density.\nCons of nuclear: slow build times, higher cost per MWh, project and financing risk.",

You can’t read it as if it was written today. \n\nDune is clearly about imperialism, spice is oil, the Fremen are Arabs oppressed by imperialist oil-seeking powers. But, this is not specifically about the US. The Fremen vs. imperialism story is very obviously based on Lawrence of Arabia and Herbert said as much. The Fremen aren’t “the good guys” and the book is just as much a critique of blind faith in a charismatic leader as it is in imperialism. The houses fighting over Arrakis could be seen as broadly including the US and imperialism in general but more directly reference the British Empire and Soviet Union. Herbert compared CHOAM to OPEC, so you could also include contemporary Arab states among imperial, oppressive, extractive powers in his view.\n\nHarkonnen don’t represent Israel. This is the most unfounded claim in your post. Again, this is a very 21st century social media reading. It doesn’t make sense in a 1965 context as these narratives were different then. Herbert chose the name because he felt it sounded Soviet (it’s actually Finnish and he got it from a phone book). \n\nThe movies don’t censor the obvious parallel with oil and the critique of religion and imperialism. That’s still there, and still relevant of course. They do “censor” direct references to jihad, aiming to make the Fremen less of a direct reference to a particular people. I’m not sure you’ve read the books if you think the reader is supposed to be put in the shoes of the Fremen.",

By the time we reached the current situation with exploits and dynamic ecosystems, nobody was implementing from scratch, there were plenty of prior art to get inspiration from/copy paste/import/recycle. \n\nIt's pretty cool what they did here tbh, and I feel moving on from cool to production ready/economically viable will creep on us sooner rather than later.",

Do you see how all the dots are basically just rotating left-right east-west, as though some giant invisible hand were \"mixing\" the outer sphere of satellites with a stirring stick? Yeah, orbits don't work like that lmao. Any orbit even irregular ones over the poles have to basically align themselves over the core of the earth, the center of gravity, with minor course corrections allowed to still stay in a stable orbit. There is no object that can orbit, for example, in a wide circle continuously over a pole, or over any region of the Earth. This is impossible without extreme fuel usage which would last at best a matter of days before fully spent.",

FYI, the graphic is not even showing Starlink, they're in LEO which is much closer to Earth than this.\n\n\nThe Singularity isn't JUST AI development.  We need infrastructure, especially communications infrastructure, to make it a reality.  We need to expand our footprint on the stars, to build the launch capability to unlock the limitless resources of our solar system.  Space holds the promise of giving us a post scarcity society and undermine the conflicts that arise from competition over limited resources here on Earth.  \n\n\nStarlink is essentially paying for Spacex to develop a scale and economy of space launch unlike anything that has ever existed before.  They've created competition in this space and given rise to dozens of new startups, each innovating and trying new ideas.\n\n\nThe sentiment that they ate NASA or are bad for NASA is ridiculous for anyone that pays attention to the field.  NASA gets tenfold more capability through these contracts than they ever would have had on their own.  If you don't believe me, please take a look at SLS, the budgets and timelines vs capability when compared to falcon 9, Starship and Blue Origin's New Glenn (BONG 😁).  Its not even close.  Private companies, mostly Spacex so far, make it economical for NASA to do more on the same budget and focus more on funding research missions and project management for endeavors that benefit humanity but may not turn a profit.  Its a beneficial relationship for everyone involved.\n\n\n/rant, I just see a ton of negativity here on space related posts because people either see it as irrelevant to the future or just personally hate Musk.  Spacex is more than Musk, and something that is objectively good for the world is objectively good regardless of the personalities involved.",

By all accounts he was incompetent with things like PayPal, and was only given tasks that wouldn’t affect things dramatically if he bungled just to keep him occupied and for him to think he made a difference. He needed a BABYSITTER. Open AI could be compared to an artistic IP in the financial books. If you could see what it can do you can put some subjective  accounting value on it based on its current form, which still used outside minds to accomplish. But what accountants can’t do is correctly anticipate an IP or properties potential. They could say that the Transformers franchise is in the gutter, but they are always saying that from a point of limited knowledge - most likely it will stay the same, but what if some genius turns it on its head that was against what the industry was trying? There is no book value then. The same with Musk’s pledge - it needs to be scaled. Without the Open AI guys or Microsoft, he would need to pledge infinitely more money to find experts like them or have the same results- his billions wouldn’t stretch far unless he took advantage of overworked college graduates with the threat of being fired or kicked out of some company everybody idolizes on the outside, which he does at SpaceX, or Tesla. And after that he slaps his name on what everybody that risked their livelihood did by working 100 hours a week. This guy is like the brain harnesses in the matrix. He is the sweatshop of think tanks.\n\nI’d even go as far as to say making a contribution with the intention that if you make money later is a snake’s way of enforcing what would be an unenforceable contract, or cutting a blank check when in reality if you gave that number to the company they would say no thanks, we are completely fine and will find financing for less. It’s sneaky that you didn’t divulge that to a company, and does not give them a chance to find someone else; he sat his ass down and monopolized that position without letting them know the contract and to seek other people. What Musk is complaining about is the entire history of business making. When Mr. Wonderful offers to buy a share of your pancake business for 1,000,000, you sometimes take that cut for security purposes, even if you know the business could be better or more profitable. And you have no clue either, cause now the profitability could be partly due to Mr. Wonderful and his expertise. He never let them set the terms.",

Tesla delivered only 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, so this represents a massive scaling challenge.\n\n\n> - **Robotaxi Fleet**: He needs to put 1 million operational robotaxis on the roads, despite the fact that Tesla hasn't yet launched any commercial robotaxis and full self-driving technology still requires human oversight.\n\n\n> - **Humanoid Robots**: Musk must deliver 1 million humanoid robots, even though these robots haven't gone on sale yet and remain under development.\n\n\n> - **Full Self-Driving Subscriptions**: He must attract 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature, a significant adoption challenge given current subscription levels.\n\n\n> As one legal expert put it, the board's proposal states that Musk would have to \"completely transform Tesla and society as we know it\" to earn the full package.",

However, it’s vital to have a basis in math before you can even judge if an AI-generated solution or \"new theorem\" is actually valid.\n\nEventually, we may reach a point where we stop fully understanding the math AI discovers, and we’ll need a \"simplified universe\" to explain it to ourselves.

It is a different story when you get to high school.\n\nHowever, the situation is different with AI in college. A college student can benefit learning \\*from\\* AI, but not using AI to do all his/her work.\n\nI run in-person exams, in my class, where obviously no AI is allowed. But I do advise my student to use AI to help study and give them specific suggestions of how to prompt. (e.g. copy and paste a HW question, and ask AI to generate similar questions with different numbers and wordings, and do not provide the answer. You type in the answer steps by steps and let AI to identify the step you have problems with, if you get the answer wrong.)\n\nI obviously have no way to enforce anything outside of the classroom, and they know that. So it does boil down to student motivation. My only recourse is in-person exams.",

First this is only for circulant matrices which is a highly restricted class of matrices, so that might explain the large percentage improvement. But so know when it applies to 5x5 matrices it can generalized to larger matrices using \\[block matrix multiplication\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block\\_matrix) so the gains can be realized for larger matrices. So it's not only going to be \"only 5x5\" \n\nBut the caveat is that these new \"faster matrix multiplication\" algorithms may always help. Writing efficient matrix multiplication requires other considerations such as memory management. This is why these algorithms aren't really used in deep learning, even though matrix multiplication is very common. \n\nThe way I see it these new matrix multiplication algorithms would only be useful for large matrices, so that the gains of reducing the number of operations outweigh the losses from the more complex data movement imposed by the new algorithm. The key will be implementing it with memory management in mind. Interestingly enough, I believe AIs will also be able to help greatly with creating truly efficient implementations. I think I recall a story recently of a person scoring high on a GPU coding competition with the help of AI. (It'd be great if someone who knows what I'm talking about could link it)",

The AI discovered a new tensor decomposition which can be plugged into an already existing algorithm for improved performance. This is comparable to something like AlphaFold that discovers new protein structures. In neither of these cases is the AI itself \"creating a new algorithm\". What they are doing is searching through a well defined but extremely large space of possible solutions to a problem until they find something that works. \n\nThe distinction is important because I would still consider work of this nature to be \"narrow\" AI. AI focused on solving one particular problem well. Think, playing chess or Go. It's the kind of thing we've had for decades, just improved upon. This is contrast to recent results where I see AI proving mathematical theorems which is much more in line with the notion of \"general AI\" that seems to be emerging recently.",

If a human would be given these json files with the task to solve the game, they would first make a drawing corresponding to the coordinates given, then only estimate which direction to move and send an answer. \n\nIt's like giving a riddle of the form \"my cat is on the carpet that is under the table that is itself on my floor. What is the list of items from bottom to top?\", that they also used to struggle with. To solve that kind of problem, networks do develop spatial understandings. For another example they spontaneously form internal world maps because they had to to answer geography questions. \n\nIf I give a text file containing the color data in rgb for each pixel, and ask for a text file containing a mask of individuals in the underlying pictures, it's also a task that relies on visual understanding despite of it being a text file. \n\nAny progress on visual intelligence is useful for all tasks of this sort. I'd argue a lot of math also falls into this category, because a mathematician uses their visual representations to setup their formal strategy.",

Humans and animals don't use words/tokens to analyze their environment or to mentally model the worlds physics.\n\nConsider what is required when a ball is tossed to someone. We see that the ball is coming at us and calculate the speed and trajectory and where to put our hand to catch it, all in fractions of a second. We can look at a picture of the same scene and we likely model the same thing in our mind from a 2D image. We're trying to do the same thing with LLMs by communicating that information from that image with words/tokens. Sure, specialized ML models can do most of this with additional sensors and still fail sometimes. Tesla tries with only cameras and fails even more. but they aren't limited to communication with tokens or words.",
