There are plenty of entities that do just that and are very successful with it.\n\n>but as an American\n\nThis doesn't qualify you in any special way as I am sure you subscribe to reddit and pajama journalism and not business weekly or the economist.\nYou do not have to be Chinese to understand why China doesn't do it and as an American you have no special insight into why it's not done here (whatever the subject).\n\nThe issue:\n\nYou are not aware that there was ***already*** supply and just until the last year or so that supply became tight.  It became tight due to AI, which 4 years ago basically did not exist. (it also might come crumbling down soon)\n\nThe companies developing chips are few and far between because:\n\n1. That has been their core business for decades and they incrementally improved on proprietary tech.\n2. Supply and demand was met. <--------------- super important.\n\nAverage redditors gonna average. We here just look for boogeymen and blame, greed and profits rule all. Very few of us can see the forest for the trees and yet we go all poetic on the trees, those in the front row, virtually no one thinks beyond that.\n\n\nIn addition, chip development is an on time business and to enter the market you must be not only on time, but on date. You cannot enter with older tech and so the few keep going and few  invest billions to trillions and a decade or more into advanced fabs that are not going to guaranty anything. There is also no guaranty they could even do it.\n\nDo you have any idea how the current chips are made? It's MIND BLOWING. Truly.\n\nWhat I find quite amusing however is the duality of \"we must invest\" (usually a mix of government and business) and \"I need my UBI!\" here on reddit.\nOne of the reasons we do not spend tax dollars on this kind of thing or infrastructure like we should is everyone, and I mean everyone, has their hand out and if that hand does not get the cheese, the mice go crazy. \n\nOne of the other reasons that chip manufacturing isn't started here (high end I mean), other than supply, demand and future need, is the outlay, it has nothing to do with short term vs. long term profits, you cannot generate money out of thin air when funding a company for this, it takes actual liquidity, cash and a LOT of it.\n\nThere are only a handful of companies that could even attempt (Apple, Microsoft etc..) it but it's NOT their core business, so they do not even bother.\n\nIt's not greed, it's not profit, it's none of those things. But we say these things to feel smarter and more informed than we are and (virtually) no one on reddit will ever call someone out for berating unknown corporate boogeymen.\n\nSociety gets dumber when we upvote the empty hyperbolic comments and parrot.",

But eventually, you hit a wall where it won’t go smaller because the wavelength of the light is too big. So you try lower wave length — blue light. That requires some new kind of laser source, but you get there eventually and now your prints are way smaller. Repeat this process every time you hit a wall where it can’t go smaller. The light source gets harder and harder to produce, but science has been working on this for a long time. ",

ASML started in 1984 and through good planning, R&D (and the support of some academic institutions, primarily IMEC) and business relationships (the alternatives for chip makers were Canon & Nikon in Japan), became the de facto lithography system vendors for the big semiconductor manufacturers by the early 2000s. \n\nIt took them almost 2 decades to properly achieve EUV lithography, from their first prototype in 2001 to production in 2019. They also happened to buy US based lithography company SVG in 2001, which was pretty much the only US lithography capability at the time.\n\nAnd they’re also just one of the various niche vendors involved in the whole supply and manufacturing chain for silicon chips. The US and China are better served buying their equipment for their semiconductor fabrication plants than figuring everything out on their own, and that is the route that the US chip manufacturers will be taking. ASML could potentially be bought out or at least have a majority stake acquired by US interests, but with a market capitalization of $430 billion that seems unlikely.",

Even apps like Cursor change the design and add / modify features weekly while at the same time the underlying API models are not deterministic, they can be good one week and bad the next if throttling or other changes are being made by the vendor or middlemen. You can develop an AI programming workflow that can be made obsolete in a few weeks or months by the tool vendors. It causes burnout as it is mentally taxing to work in high levels of abstraction that are constantly changing.",

So instead of worrying about the specific tooling and how it morphs over the next few years, focus instead on creating specs and defining tasks. Devs still think they are coders, but really if you break a task down enough, all code can be solved by AI now.\n\nDevs need to definitively move up to that next layer of abstraction and they will find that it feels a lot clearer above the clouds.",

Yes - these models hallucinate and have their quirks and pitfalls. They are not perfect. Not even close.

The concept applies to any domain. At its core, to me, these models have made it easier to brainstorm, explore ideas, challenge my own assumptions, and rapidly prototype in a way that was not possible for me prior to 2022.\n\n\nWe have access to a new type of tool, and it's going to take time to learn what types of problems these tools are good for.\n\n\nIf we have a tool that, in the right context, makes it easier to navigate through various ideas quicker - to me it is clear that this will have an impact downstream for so many things.\n\n\nI'm happy to hear any critiques or opinions on my experience here.

I’m a principle engineer for our company and I’ve spent the past 6 months building out  tooling like skills, commands, agents, and mcp servers to make sure ai has access to all of our internal tools and libraries, and all the context required to complete a task. From there it’s just about breaking it down into pieces small enough to handle within a single context window to prevent degradation on compaction. \n\nWe have sections of the app that we had been unable to refactor without breaking the legacy shit piled on in layers over the years. Ai has actually handled those incredibly well and now those sections of the app are maintainable and don’t crash our app. Things that would have taken weeks now take days, and as we go, we are writing tests and strong typing to give the ai more context so it doesn’t break crap.",

Why?  Because if that system is damaged in combat, or goes down, pilots who have not mastered landing under those conditions will die.\n\nThere have been [recent studies](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/) that show that the over-reliance on LLMs in recent years has actually started to impact our learning and cognition, and this is the very beginning of the transformation.\n\nWhat scares me more than anything, is that we're raising a new cadre of people that have become so thoroughly reliant on AI that they're no longer equipped to spot the hallucinations.\n\nLook, I'm a few years away from retirement.

And maybe you forecast absolute numbers for next year. Using AI, you can have it reason with a Bayesian approach, and you forecast next year's uptime and hack attempts by the five most likely scenarios, with probabilities assigned to each. An example corporate speak: *‘Given current load growth, dependency risk, and staffing, here are 5 plausible reliability trajectories (P10/P50/P90), what would cause each, and what we should do now to protect the downside.’* \n\nThis is more similar to weather forecasting (old era of rain or not rain vs. 60% chance of rain in the afternoon). That becomes much more useful to the business.\n\nSo yeah, your mindset is already there. The bigger lift is getting stakeholders to stop demanding “the number” (that a sql query spits out) and start demanding “the best action under uncertainty,” plus the eval loops that keep the system honest.",

Each person will have at their disposition the equivalent of a large tech company's worth of engineers. And this will require even more computer than what is being planned today. The capabilities of this tech and its adoption are increasing way faster than we can build compute.

There are two different school of thoughts here: Vibe coding and A.I assisted development. Vibe coding can go far, but with the user not having software experience then the app or software will inevitably get fucked unless you have the business sense to hire a code reviewer or something along those lines. Now A.I assisted development I truly believe can go far which I define is the user having the Knowledge in coding  while using the LLMs which is more or less a symbiotic relationship that what I believe could surpass even traditional software development. I believe that is the future. Being a composer with that expertise of music while the LLM is your orchestra.",

It's like an automobile company is trying to develop a product line, they're tooling up their factory and selecting part suppliers and training staff, and every couple of days during this process some over-caffeinated inventors kick down the door excitedly reporting how they've developed an *entirely new* form of engine that's twice as powerful or efficient or half as expensive as the one the previous design had.\n\nObviously the automobile company can't be constantly restarting their product line development from square one each time that happens, they'd never actually *produce* anything.

          "text": "My experience as someone who hadn't written a line of code and started learning just before gpt 4s released has been kind of a blessing. I was stagnant in my career and needed a change and scripting seemed to be a way I could keep my job and learn. Gpt 3.5 wasn't very accurate so I was primarily on stack overflow to start. Gpt 4 made it so my questions could be answered more like stack overflow but not a full on do everything coder. Also being limited to 10 back and forth conversations on bing due to chatgpt being blocked at work was very helpful in that it couldn't just do everything for me, I actually had to learn. \n\nThis all taught me that these tools are the best thing for learning and not doing everything. For the most part they are not accurate enough nor have the contextual awareness to always do their job correctly. However the models and some companies like cursor have done phenomenal. If you have the bedrock understanding of how things are working and why, you really know when to lean on llms and when to not. I recall people complaining about replits agent when it came out because it didn't do simple things right. Instead of using that as a learning opportunity like masking during ai training, to learn those building blocks well enough that you can communicate it to the model or tailor its outputs to get what you want.\n\nThis is all to say that folks that are overfit to being software engineers are not leveraging its strengths the same way because they can just write the code themselves, it's not going to do it better or in the same way you would so why would you use it? And essentially any specified discipline has this problem with agents. It's not going to do a better job than someone that's an expert in it already. My recommendation I give to people wanting to learn or feeling trapped like Andrej is to use it to bridge into other disciplines. Bringing expertise from one discipline into another that has never heard of concepts you know is the easiest way to make progress at the moment. We now have personal tutors that make it just good enough to communicate across domains and understand how you can impact each other.",

This guy worked for a month and made a half baked gui but left the company to pursue higher studies. Instead of recruiting a new guy, i used google gemini to make the entire thing in a days time and it works perfectly. Even gemini give pretty good suggestions which i implemented, even it give suggestions on implementation og algorithms to seperate blocks of data, check if data received is correct etc. Further it helped in documenting it and also made a flow chart.

It's not just about using the tools, but understanding their probabilistic nature and limitations. I've found that the programmers who are thriving are the ones who've learned to think in terms of prompt engineering and iterative refinement, rather than expecting deterministic outputs. The skill isn't disappearing, it's transforming into something that requires both traditional software engineering knowledge and a new kind of AI literacy.",

          "text": "This tweet by Andrej Karpathy (a founding member of OpenAI and former Director of AI at Tesla) captures a pivotal moment in software engineering. He describes the transition from deterministic coding (writing logic manually) to AI orchestration (managing probabilistic models to write logic for you).\nTo \"not fall behind,\" you need to understand that the Software Engineer role is shifting toward AI Systems Engineering.\nHere is a detailed breakdown of every concept mentioned, categorized by their layer in the new stack.\n1. The New Architecture: Agents & Subagents\nKarpathy mentions \"Agents, subagents... workflows.\"\n• The Concept:\nIn traditional programming, you write a script A that calls script B. In the new paradigm, an Agent is an LLM wrapper equipped with a loop: Observe → Reason → Act → Observe Result.\n• Agent: The main orchestrator (e.g., \"Build a React App\").\n• Subagent: Specialized workers called by the main agent (e.g., \"CSS Expert,\" \"Database Architect,\" \"Unit Tester\").\n• Workflows: The defined paths these agents follow. This is moving from \"Chat\" (unstructured) to \"Flows\" (structured steps like Plan -> Code -> Review -> Fix).\n• Technical Deep Dive:\n• ReAct Pattern: The fundamental logic of agents. The model outputs a \"Reason\" (I need to check the file) and an \"Act\" (call readFile).\n• Orchestration Frameworks: You need to learn frameworks that wire these together.\n• LangGraph / LangChain: For building stateful, multi-actor applications.\n• CrewAI / AutoGen: For multi-agent collaboration.\n• Study Sources:\n• LangChain: Introduction to Agents\n• Microsoft AutoGen Paper\n2. The Connectivity Layer: MCP, LSP, & Hooks\nKarpathy lists \"MCP, LSP, Hooks, APIs.\" This is the plumbing of the future.\n• LSP (Language Server Protocol):\n• What it is: An existing standard (created by Microsoft) that powers VS Code. It tells the editor where functions are defined, handles autocomplete, and highlights errors.\n• Why it matters now: AI agents are hooking into LSPs to \"read\" code properly. Instead of just seeing text, the AI uses the LSP to understand the dependency graph of your project. If you are building AI dev tools, you must understand LSP.\n• MCP (Model Context Protocol):\n• What it is: A newly emerging open standard (championed by Anthropic and others). It solves the \"n+1\" problem of connecting AI to data.\n• The Problem: Previously, to connect ChatGPT to Google Drive, Slack, and GitHub, you needed custom integrations for each.\n• The Solution: MCP provides a universal standard. If a data source (like a Postgres DB) speaks MCP, any AI client (Claude, Cursor, etc.) can connect to it immediately.\n• Action Item: Learn how to write an MCP server to expose your company’s internal data to your AI agents.\n• Hooks:\n• Event-driven triggers. Instead of a human prompting the AI, the AI runs on hooks (e.g., git push triggers an AI agent to review the diff and comment on the PR).\n• Study Sources:\n• Official Model Context Protocol (MCP) Documentation\n• Official LSP Specification\n3. The Interface: Prompts, Contexts, & Modes\nKarpathy mentions \"Prompts, contexts... modes, slash commands.\"\n• Prompts & Contexts:\n• Context Window: The \"RAM\" of the LLM (e.g., 128k tokens, 1M tokens). You must learn Context Management—deciding what files/docs to stuff into the window versus what to leave out to prevent \"dilution\" (where the model gets confused by too much info).\n• System Prompts: The \"God-mode\" instructions hidden from the user that define the agent's persona and constraints.\n• Modes & Slash Commands:\n• This refers to UX patterns in AI IDEs (like Cursor or Windsurf).\n• Slash Commands (/edit, /test, /explain): These are macros that package specific prompts and context. For example, /test might automatically grab your file and your existing test suite, then prompt the model to \"write tests for the new code utilizing existing patterns.\"\n• Modes: Switching the AI between \"Chat Mode\" (conversational), \"Composer Mode\" (multi-file editing), or \"Agent Mode\" (autonomous execution).\n4. The Capabilities: Tools, Plugins, Skills\nKarpathy mentions \"Permissions, tools, plugins, skills.\"\n• Tools / Function Calling:\n• This is the single most important technical concept for modern AI engineering. LLMs cannot calculate math or browse the web natively.\n• How it works: You describe a function (e.g., weather(city)) in a JSON schema. The LLM does not run code; it outputs text saying \"Please run weather('Paris')\". Your code runs it, gets the result, and feeds it back to the LLM.\n• Skills: A collection of tools grouped together (e.g., a \"Database Skill\" might include query_sql, list_tables, describe_schema).\n• Permissions:\n• As agents get more autonomous (accessing your file system or shell), Safety Engineering becomes critical. You need to architect \"Human-in-the-loop\" permission systems so the AI doesn't accidentally rm -rf /.\n• Study Sources:\n• OpenAI Function Calling Guide\n• Anthropic Tool Use Documentation\n5. The \"Alien Tool\" & Stochastic Engineering\nKarpathy refers to \"Stochastic, fallible, unintelligible... entities.\"\n• The Shift from Deterministic to Stochastic:\n• Old Engineering: Input A always leads to Output B. If it fails, it's a bug.\n• New Engineering: Input A usually leads to Output B, but sometimes Output C.\n• The Skill Issue: You need to build \"Evals\" (Evaluations). You cannot trust the AI. You must write code that validates the AI's code.\n• IDE Integrations (\"The Alien Tool\"):\n• He is likely referring to next-gen editors like Cursor or Windsurf. These aren't just VS Code with a chatbox; they index your code embeddings locally and predict your next edit, not just your next word.\n• Action Item: If you are still typing every character in VS Code, you are falling behind. Switch to an AI-native IDE and learn its keyboard shortcuts.\nSummary: How to study this list\nTo claim the \"10X boost\" Karpathy mentions, follow this curriculum:\n1. Master the \"Alien Tool\": Download Cursor or Windsurf. Learn how to use @Codebase indexing and .cursorrules to customize the AI's behavior.\n2. Learn \"Function Calling\": Build a simple Python script using the OpenAI or Anthropic API that gives the LLM access to a calculator or a weather API. This teaches you \"Tools.\"\n3. Understand MCP: Read the Model Context Protocol spec. Try to connect a local SQLite database to an LLM using an MCP server.\n4. Study Evals: Learn how to benchmark LLM performance using a framework like DeepEval or Promptfoo. This helps you manage the \"stochastic\" nature of the models.\nKarpathy’s point is that the \"Manual\" for this tool doesn't exist yet—we are writing it in real-time.",

      "text": "I don't want to play the credentials game, but I've worked at FAANG companies and \"unicorns\". Won't doxx myself more than that but if anyone wants to privately validate over DM I'll happily do so. I only say this because comments are often like, \"it won't cut it at faang,\" or \"vibe coding doesn't work in production\" or stuff like that.\n\nWork is, in many ways, it's the most interesting it's ever been. No topic feels off limits, and the amount I can do and understand and learn feels only gated by my own will. And yet, it's also *extremely* anxiety inducing. When Claude and I pair to knock out a feature that may have taken weeks solo, I can't help but be reminded of \"centaur chess.\" For a few golden years in the early 2000s, the best humans directing the best AIs could beat the best AIs, a too-good-to-be-true outcome that likely delighted humanists and technologists alike. Now, however, in 2025, if 2 chess AIs play each other and a human dares to contribute a single \"important\" move on behalf of an AI, that AI will lose. How long until knowledge work goes a similar way?\n\nI feel like the only conclusion is that: Knowledge work is done, soon. Opus 4.5 has proved it beyond reasonable doubt. There is very little that I can do that Claude cannot. My last remaining edge is that I can cram more than 200k tokens of context in my head, but surely this won't last. Anthropic researchers are pretty quick to claim this is just a temporary limitation. Yes, Opus isn't perfect and it does odd things from time to time, but here's a reminder that even 4 months ago, the term \"vibe coding\" was mostly a twitter meme. Where will we be 2 months (or 4 SOTA releases) from now? How are we supposed to do quarterly planning?\n\nAnd it's not just software engineering. Recently, I saw a psychiatrist, and beforehand, I put my symptoms into Claude and had it generate a list of medication options with a brief discussion of each. During the appointment, I recited Claude's provided cons for the \"professional\" recommendation she gave and asked about Claude's preferred choice instead. She changed course quickly and admitted I had a point. Claude has essentially prescribed me a medication, overriding the opinion of a trained expert with years and years of schooling.\n\nSince then, whenever I talk to an \"expert,\" I wonder if it'd be better for me to be talking to Claude.\n\nI'm legitimately at risk of losing relationships (including a romantic one), because I'm unable to break out of this malaise and participate in \"normal\" holiday cheer. How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies: most are a reminder of just how load-bearing of an institution the office job is for the world that we know. I am not so cynical usually, and I am generally known to be cheerful and energetic. So, this change in my personality is evident to everyone.\n\nI can't keep shouting into the void like this. Now that I believe the takeoff is coming, I want it to happen as fast as possible so that we as a society can figure out what we're going to do when no one has to work.\n\nTweets from others validating what I feel:  \nKarpathy: \"[the bits contributed by the programmer](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2004607146781278521?s=20) are increasingly sparse and between\"\n\nDeedy: \"[A few software engineers at the best tech cos told me that their entire job is prompting cursor or claude code and sanity checking it](https://x.com/deedydas/status/2000472514854825985?s=20)\"\n\nDeepMind researcher Rohan Anil, \"[I personally feel like a horse in ai research and coding. Computers will get better than me at both, even with more than two decades of experience writing code, I can only best them on my good days, it’s inevitable.\"](https://x.com/_arohan_/status/1998110656558776424)\n\nStephen McAleer, Anthropic Researcher:[ I've shifted my research to focus on automated alignment research. We will have automated AI research very soon and it's important that alignment can keep up during the intelligence explosion.](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/2002205061737591128)\n\nJackson Kernion, Anthropic Researcher: [I'm trying to figure out what to care about next. I joined Anthropic 4+ years ago, motivated by the dream of building AGI. I was convinced from studying philosophy of mind that we're approaching sufficient scale and that anything that can be learned can be learned in an RL env.](https://x.com/JacksonKernion/status/2004707758768271781?s=20)\n\nAaron Levie, CEO of box: [We will soon get to a point, as AI model progress continues, that almost any time something doesn’t work with an AI agent in a reasonably sized task, you will be able to point to a lack of the right information that the agent had access to. ](https://x.com/levie/status/2001888559725506915?s=20)\n\nAnd in my opinion, the ultimate harbinger of what's to come:  \nSholto Douglas, Anthropic Researcher: [Continual Learning will be solved in a satisfying way in 2026](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9pof/anthropics_sholto_douglas_predicts_continual/)\n\nDario Amodei, CEO of anthropic: [We have evidence to suggest that continual learning is not as difficult as it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1pu9og6/continual_learning_is_solved_in_2026/)\n\nI think the last 2 tweets are interesting - Levie is one of the few claiming \"Jevon's paradox\" since he thinks humans will be in the loop to help with context issues. However, the fact that Anthropic seems so sure they'll solve continual learning makes me feel that it's just wishful thinking. If the models can learn continuously, then the majority of the value we can currently provide (gathering context for a model) is useless.\n\nI also want to point out that, when compared to OpenAI and even Google DeepMind, Anthropic doesn't really hypepost. They dropped Opus 4.5 almost without warning. Dario's prediction that AI would be writing 90% of code was if anything an understatement (it's probably close to 95%).\n\nLastly, I don't think that anyone really grasps what it means when an AI can do everything better than a human. Elon Musk questions it [here](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/musk-predicts-ai-create-universal-high-income-make-saving-money-unnecessary), McAlister talks about how he'd like to do science but can't because of asi [here](https://x.com/McaleerStephen/status/1938302250168078761?s=20), and the twitter user tenobrus encapsulates it most perfectly [here](https://x.com/tenobrus/status/2004987319305339234?s=20).",

I’ve already spent months suffering over this, and at some point you stop reopening the same wound. Now I mostly take these things for what they are: human and social rituals, not reliable signals of future security.\nOn top of that, I deal with panic attacks. They’re somewhat better now, but they still limit my ability to transition into many careers that are often described as “more resilient” — even setting aside the question of how long any of those will actually remain so. That reality makes incremental stability a rational choice for me, not denial.\nWhat I hope for, more than any personal outcome, is that we manage to organize ourselves as a society for what’s coming.

However, none of us has a crystal ball with 100% accuracy. There are almost always externalities our outside context we can't predict.\n\nBy allowing ourselves to stand at the precipice of uncertainty, and contemplating the possibility of a positive outcome (even if low it's still possible and that's what matters) we can undo the negative prediction and substantially reduce associated anxiety. The outcome may still be bad, but if it was going to happen anyway feeling less anxious only helps you manage better throughout and in the aftermath.\n\nI've adopted this protocol and try to apply it anytime I feel anxiety creeping in.

How can I pretend to be excited for the New Year, making resolutions and bingo cards as usual, when all I see in the near future is strife, despair, and upheaval? How can I be excited for a cousin's college acceptance, knowing that their degree will be useless before they even set foot on campus? I cannot even enjoy TV series or movies\n\nThis seems like the problem.\n\nHere's my advice:\n\nNext time you have several days off of work, go camping by yourself. Drive out into the woods or desert, someplace with _no people_ at all. Not close enough to talk to, not close enough hear, not close enough to see them. Trees and dirt, that's your company. Bring a tent, a comfortable chair, a sleeping bag, bring water and simple/boring food that doesn't require cooking, but _nothing_ to entertain yourself with. No books, no toys, no mobile devices, no cameras, no radios...nothing.\n\nGo out there, camp in the middle of nowhere, by yourself. And this is important: _Turn off your phone_. Leave it in your car, and _don't touch it_ until it's time to go home. Spend a couple of days, by yourself, with nobody else, and no distractions. No youtube. No reddit. No social media. Just you, by yourself, with the sun and the sky.\n\nWhat do you do? Nothing. _The point of this_ is to do nothing. You're allowed to think, but don't sing, don't talk, not to yourself, not to anybody. You're allowed to eat, but don't distract yourself with food. Don't plan for the future, stay in the now. _Be alone with yourself_. \n\nAnd do...nothing.\n\nDo nothing, while nowhere...for three days.\n\nWhen you come back, all of the things you're worrying about now will seem small and unimportant.",

I could use 3 days in the woods myself. \n\nThe loop is fear of what's coming then an attempt to find a safe place to rest during the coming upheaval. But nobody knows what will actually be safe. You can have an idea of this... but nobody actually knows, lack of safety. \n\nOur human minds get caught in a survival loop trying to figure out how to survive this new threat and there's never been a threat like this before...so we just keep looping on \"what do I do, what do I do?\" If you're an engineer you likely started by trying to tame the fear by gaining control over AI technologies, telling yourself \"AI can't write production code, it still needs a human in the loop\". \n\nIf your the sort of engineer that sees the inevitable you went a step further, you didn't stop at AI assistance, you kept pushing the boundaries of what AI could do, and had it code prosthetics for itself in order to make it do more things. As you were learning and practicing with AI, AI got better in mind blowing ways every month while you were still just learning... so even skilled developers find themselves, learning and re-learning, and adapting to an entire system change almost monthly as the way you build things with AI yesterday is not the same as you build it today.  \n\nYou find yourself reorganizing your custom AI coding configuration to do more and more, encompassing more autonomy... and realize the writing is on the wall.  That's where the depression comes in, right next to all the excitement gained from automating things that have never been automated before. \n\nI really hope becoming as much an expert in methods of building will carry through to the future, but I can also see it being futile. Tons of effort that's just wasted as soon as AI truly doesn't need us in the loop anymore, which seems way too soon. In my own frameworks I'm working really hard to try and find ways of displaying all the complexity of a codebase that might enable skilled humans to better steer... but how long will anything stay at the stage it's at? Knowledge investments in this period seem really unstable and unclear how much you will get in return from them.",

When we only had Sonnet, I was initially very excited but then realized for production use cases where others would be reviewing my code, I had to do a lot of work cleaning up outputs and settled on the tab-completion model as the best way to speed up work (Karpathy landed at the same).\n\nWith Opus though, it's different. I have to force myself to ask myself, can Opus 1 shot this? before starting any piece of work, and most of the time, it can. The only issue is for now, Opus can't infer my intent. The limiting factor is not that Opus can work for 4 hours, it's that I can't specify a task well enough that would take more than 30 minutes to do without changing my mind after reading the code or similar.\n\nNow I could build work arounds for this, or try to mess around with agent rules or similar, but my hunch is that all of it will be made useless with the next mode drop and the speedup isn't worth it (for now). I bet the next Claude will ask perfect clarifying questions, or better yet, be able to turned unstructured user feedback into something actionable. It's very likely that the next iteration of claude will prompt YOU (and you can see that in the feature that they built in cc where it suggests the next prompt).",

Most people who argue that the have-nots will still be treated like crap think about this in a context with scarcity, when that is precisely the thing that has been eradicated, at least materially. Assuming abundance, everyone should have more than what they will need. \n\nMy bigger concern will be about the incumbent political system and its benefactors, and how they will attempt to hold on and maintain power. All political systems have been formed under this assumption of scarcity, and one of their main functions is redistribution. Without material scarcity, there ceases to be a reason for their existence -- at least of the political systems we have in our current form. In reality though, the politicians will try everything they have to hang on -- to maintain influence over other humans, possibly what is one of the truly scarce things left in such a world -- and I imagine that wars and conflict will inevitably happen. This prospect is really terrifying.",

I'm sure we've seen just how far even a middle management position can go to someone's head, but thankfully, that's constrained to the workplace for now. Without work to provide these prestige/power symbols, where will people get it?\n\nAnd yeah, on a practical level, this technology will take power away quickly to the people that are the most used to enjoying it (affluent white collar types, politicians). Whenever that's happened, there's been violent revolution. Let's hope we're ready for that.",

That's why there is a growing literature where reducing working hours somehow seems to boost productivity.  \nFor those on a salary (in comparison to contract hours), there is also an ambiguity of work expectations. People fear being called lazy if they work less - even if as in the former point it results in higher productivity - and most work is performative rather than real, i.e. looking busy than actually being busy.  \nIn developing countries especially, people cannot afford not to work. Not because they cannot afford to live if they don't, but rather because if they do not work longer and harder, then they will be replaced. This is particularly the case in China where overworking is considered the norm and you cannot simply decide to clock out when the work day is over.  \nAs many others have commented on similar posts, humans will always create scarcity, even artificially if necessary. In a sense we're living in post-scarcity right now, or should be. Yet why is there hunger and homelessness in developed countries? We have the resources, but \"economic barriers\" prevent equitable distribution. We think we \"have to work\" to simply put food on the table, but that is no longer true. It is a borderline mental disorder to claim in our current economic situation that we MUST work when the capital (built on alienated labour) already exists to cover all the basic necessities we need.   \nOf course, I do not mean that we can simply not work in every sense. I just mean, that our obsession with work is perhaps the greatest hurdle that keeps us working to live, when we could instead live to work on our hobbies, passions, past-times, etc.",

Once these labs train their models to use externalized long-term memory and to leverage existing SWE techniques at the right time and place, the benefit I offer is that other humans can talk to me so that I can talk to the AI.

That massively flatters current models.\nReal-world engineering (EE, mechanical, systems) is the opposite: it’s physical, high-context, full of tacit knowledge, messy tradeoffs, and requires asking the right questions, not just answering prompts. It decomposes into thousands of domain-specific micro-tasks that don’t generalize well and don’t have clean reward functions or benchmarks.\n\n\nSo no, we’re not close to automating most real-world engineering jobs. This isn’t just “needs more data”, it’s a missing paradigm problem. The Bitter Lesson is being misapplied outside domains with clean rules and simulators.\n\n\nAI will keep being an amazing assistant (I use it daily in electrical engineering), but outside of software, “AIs replacing engineers” is mostly a Silicon Valley halucination driven by overfitting to the software engineer's worldview.",

For others, I understand that it very much doesn't or won't feel that way.\n\nI am a meditator and I study Buddhist philosophy. The only sane way to look at all of this is through a very long historical or cosmic perspective. I have certain beliefs that help me deal with all of this that most people on here would reject, although they are no weirder than what a hell of a lot of people on here believe. (Mind-uploading?)",

So they remain AI skeptics. They still talk about what college they want their kids to go to, as if things will look the same in 15 years time. \n\nMy focus now is to stay on top of new advancements and tools. There should still be some time that  companies need people like us that are quick to adopt and apply new AI tools. I am still hopeful that being managers of agents will be in demand for a few years.

          "text": "Psychiatrist here. Your degree of fear of uncertainty about the future and ongoing existential angst  do make me wonder if there is a component of amygdalar hijacking secondary to chronic stress leading to HPA axis dysregulation which influence your narrative of your lifeworld. \n\nI'm glad you are seeing a psychiatrist but I hope you also understand that medication is likely not going to eliminate the source of your mental distress which is the perceived short-term and long-term threat to your psychosocial stability. There is likely some level of confirmation bias influenced by your pre-existing personality tendencies for intellectualization and striving for perfectionism although I can't say this for sure unless I get to know you better. \n\nI think it will be reasonable to consider intensive CBT (with a clinical psychologist, if possible) as part of your treatment. Trying CBT with AI may not be a bad start either given how great they are at socratic questioning now. I sense that you may have developed some rigid core beliefs and reduced cognitive flexibility which are contributing to the perceived short-term and long-term threats.\n\nSome probing questions: you mentioned that the psychiatrist quickly changed their suggestion given your input which was formulated by a GPT. Do you know for sure that the AI \"outsmarted\" your psychiatrist? I ask this because this experience have somewhat solidified your belief that AI is more of an \"expert\" than human experts.  An important component of choosing which psychiatric med to try is the patient's perceived sense of efficacy of the medication. Some may brush this off as placebo, but this sense of efficacy provides several dimensions of psychological protection (of external locus) including a sense of new hope that they are on a medication, that they are being followed by a mental health expert, and that even if their life circumstances are terrible, the medication could at least somewhat correct things. These thoughts ultimately provide a sense of stability which, when combined with the sertonergic effects of the medication which dampens HPA axis hyperactivation, can lead to the acute treatment of dysregulated anxiety reaction. Without digressing further, my point is that your psychiatrist being open to trying your suggestion may have been intentional. \n\nAnother question: What does it mean by being an \"expert\"? I recently wondered about this question after quickly realizing that AIs can easily regurgitate the 1st, 2nd, 3rd line treatment options of any psychiatric disorders. After some reflection, I learned that starting a medication is only a small portion of what I do. What makes me an expert in my job is my willingness to connect and walk along with my patients with integrity and compassion no matter how complex their biopsychosociospiritual problems are. A big part of psychological healing comes from feeling heard and acknowledged by another human being. (On a side note, philosophically I dont think AI can ever achieve this level of \"connectedness\" even if we had Cortana from Halo or Jarvis from Ironman because we are fundamentally an organic being, and GPTs are not, at least yet).\n\nI think it is obvious to most of us that another Luddite Movement is somewhat inevitable. However societies have survived it once, and they will likely survive it again. We won't know how until we cross that bridge. In the meantime, I think we can try to reflect on what is something that is inherently human or will take AI a much longer time to master and develop our career paths in that direction. For those who struggle with a sense of impending doom, i think this could be one approach to developing cognitive flexibility.",

We assume that an intelligent being will think alongside the same patterns we do because our worldview is situated from our own logical experiences.

          "text": "I am glad to see someone else of caliber here. I am not a software engineer, but have been a research scientist for computational neuroscience for much more than 10 years at top institutions. I am in the rare position to somewhat be able to compare AI with humans.\n\nThe problem is roughly this… Here is your brain: 10\\^11 neurons x 1000 synapses per neuron x 100 operations per second = 10\\^16 operations per second.\n\nBUT: 90% of neurons are in the cerebellum or subcortical and contribute minimally to ”higher cognition“. In addition there is a huge redundancy in the code being used in the brain due to biological noise (probably 10x - 100x) AND the code is extremely sparse. If you would make it dense, you could probably crank out another 10x-100x speed factor.\n\nSo where do we end up? Realistically: 10\\^12 operations per second for a human brain. Synapses can do 4 bits, no more. The DGX Spark from NVIDIA for $4000 can crank out 10\\^15 FLOPs 24/7. Let this sink in.\n\nEssentially: it’s over. I am not talking about how much LLMs improved, or any kind of new algorithm, or that we will solve continual learning soon. I am talking simply about hardware that exists right now. And the algorithms that make this DGX Spark perform at its limits WILL BE FOUND. If not by us, then by us and AI, or as you pointed out: by just AI. In addition, brain “algorithms” are nowhere near optimized, neither for survival, and especially not for the modern world. Unlike insects, neurons in mammals are mostly connected randomly.\n\nWhere are we going towards: currently models improve at a rate of 20-30 IQ points per year (see Mensa Norway test) on a ”jagged frontier“. I am not saying that the Mensa values are REAL IQ, because the skill boundary is very jagged. Just that you can see the speed of improvement.  I believe this will keep going, if not accelerate as soon as we get the „booster“ of recursive self-improvement. This time we won’t get stuck in some AI winter, this time there will be no wall, this time we march on relentlessly all the way to ASI 🚶‍♂️. And you know it in your heart.\n\nWhere does this lead us?\n\n\\-2029: computational AGI\n\n\\-2030-2032: embodied AGI\n\n\\- 2035-2040: Each AGI controls hundreds of little dirt cheap ”gripper robots“ or camera augmented machinery like a juggling master (like a boss 😎), making most of physical work unnecessary.\n\n\\- 2040-2045: The IQ of those models will be so high, their thinking so fast, that we are mere „trees“ compared to them.\n\nWhat to do? Chill.. get a hobby… photography, botany, study something new at university (art?). Reduce work time or completely quit. Because nobody will give you back the time. Don't wait for total replacement of human labor and hope this is the end of story and we will live in paradise. Those things will keep improving by 20-30 IQ points a year through that period and keep going and going. The AI in 2040 will be such incredible monsters, making all relevant decisions for us (because they are better at it)… you can’t tell where this is headed from that point onwards. So take back control of your time, your thoughts, your emotions, your life NOW. Don’t let it be controlled by some random corporation.\n\nSO ENJOY THE TIME NOW RATHER THAN LATER!",

Some of these ideas are ingeniously simple, but someone had to come up with them and also pursue them. It doesn't matter if someone else would run laps around them in terms of skill and technical finesse if that person is busy doing completely different things and has no interest or stake in the idea at all, whether they are incredibly capable on their own or have supercharged their abilities through the usage of LLMs.\n\nLLMs of course lower the barrier of entry quite considerably, especially with purely software-based ideas, but they will not magically come up with all the ideas that could be possibly derived from our present and future body of knowledge and skills. It may sound trite, but if there's something that has always interested you but which seemed far too daunting to approach, now is probably as good a time as any to have a go at climbing that mountain, given how much friction is removed and how much preliminary information can already be obtained through a very casual interaction with an LLM.",

Apart from the obvious problems with it (like concentration of power, elites' resistance to wealth redistribution, etc.) I find myself wondering what the transition phase should look like. \n\nIt's not like all jobs will be redundant at the same time and a new social system based on UBI will be established as a consequence. The jobs that will be affected first (knowledge work, especially in the software sector) are often the best paying ones (which ironically makes them particularly vulnerable to job cuts) and those that require the highest level of education. This means that there may soon be a large \"useless class\", for lack of a better term, of highly educated young people, who are used to a high standard of living. \n\nUBI will not even begin to adequately compensate for that. People in other fields like healthcare, social services, skilled trades, etc. will (understandably and rightfully) demand to be compensated well above UBI. Just look at how the working class thinks about the unemployed, especially in countries with a strong social net. Unless there's a major redistribution of wealth from the elites to the middle and lower classes (not gonna happen), the new useless class will most likely be not much better off than the currently unemployed - despite UBI. \n\nReskilling to other fields doesn't work for several reasons: First, there are not enough open positions for everyone. Second, former knowledge workers will be at a huge disadvantage in those new positions due to a lack of experience and in many cases a lack of talent. And third, it's likely only a matter of time before many of these jobs will be cut as well and it's back to square one.",

That just means that the most responsible way to use LLMs is as hardware accelerators for aggregating information, not true replacements for humans - and that's good news.\n\nRight now a ton of AI discourse commits a huge category error: assuming that “can do X better” implies “should replace the human who currently does X.” Nothing about the shape of ML makes that natural law, and in fact we're probably going to shift to a paradigm of thinking about humans as convenient, efficient, embodied platforms for distributed cognition.\n\nAs the psychological and embodied ground truth upon which ML is built - and without which it could not exist - we humans are where goals, norms, and responsibility actually live. A society that attempts to discard humanity will end up directionless, unmotivated, and gutless in pretty short order.",

But is it? Maybe what we call \"having a job\" is different now vs 20 years from now. The idea that automation will kill off jobs I find insane,  not  that it doesn't have a point, it's more that we have enough examples from history to know that the point it has is irrelevant.\n\nHaving a job *always* meant doing what our tools can't. And unless you think we are building the tool to replace all tools perfectly, then there is no reason to think that jobs will dissappear. \n\nMaybe yours will, but so what? We do not have human computers after the 1950s on and I'm glad that we don't , maybe losing human coders won't be all that bad for humanity as a whole.\n\nUltimately the issue in some of you is misjudging how powerful our artifices *can* be. Those giant companies are not building a god in a data center, but as long as people may believe that, they would also be neurotic about it.

The mistake is assuming that meaning, agency, or social value was ever cleanly tied to being the best optimizer. That was always a fragile bargain and we’re watching it break.\nWhat is still under our...human control...right now, and very much not guaranteed later, is how these systems are shaped, constrained, deployed, and socially metabolized. Not at the level of “who writes more code,” but at the level of norms, interfaces, incentives, institutions, and values. That work is messier, slower, and political. Which is also deeply human. But, hey if Opus 4.5 is writing more of your code...maybe you can find more time to play public advocate. I'm a mechanical engineer...no one is asking me for software opinions, but you? FAANG employees are the ones we need advocating for where humans fit in the new reality being written - right now.\n\nPeople like you, who understand the systems and are honest about the existential fallout, are exactly the ones who need to stay engaged, not retreat into accelerationist despair or ironic detachment. Not because optimism fixes depression (it doesn’t), but because abdication guarantees the worst-case path.\n\nIf you want frameworks that actually grapple with this - The Coming Wave and Life 3.0 are solid entry points for what survives when capability explodes.\n\nNone of this makes holiday cheer easier. But it does suggest this: the future isn’t asking whether humans can outperform machines anymore.

Where, surely, in the future -- things were done better, systems were improved, etc. And, in that future -- what, did you expect humans would still be writing all of the code? How can that scale? Have you seen the size of the Milky Way Galaxy? Of course not; no one has. But it's been measured. Our star is tiny, with billions of stars in our galaxy, and **billions of galaxies out there**. \n\nWhat -- did you expect humans would be able to explore all of that by cobbling together some Rust code? No. We need to transcend far beyond this. \n\nThis is but a step towards transhumanism. Yes, there will come a time (and how could you not expect this time to come in the future?) where humans will not be writing code. It does not mean you can't understand it. But then, there will come a time with billions of lines in codebases across distributed computing systems that are using ISAs far in advance of what we have today and quantum computing -- and it's just way, way too much for any human to comprehend. And we need that. We need that to explore. We need that complexity to make progress.\n\nThink of the leap compilers provided. Already we were using a machine to create code (and still do). This is somewhat along those lines, although quite different, of course.\n\nOnce humans are upgraded, they will gain much more understanding. \n\nBut what's happening now is that the future is coming full-barrell. I'd say to embrace it -- because there's nothing else you can do (other than sink into malaise, as you're saying you are).",

All of this is to say there are some nice workarounds for that tiny context window. \n\nPeople have no clue what's coming. Humans can't think in terms of exponentials, let alone exponentials on top of exponentials. But this is all an inevitable conclusion. From the first tool that gave humans the advantage in the war of all against all there has been a nonstop march of more and more technological augmentation. Shoes, glasses, air pods, cars, buildings these are all just manifest technologies. We came, we saw, we conquered. All of modern life is predicated on automation by the alpha predator.\n\nIf we take the AI out of the equation there is nothing sustainable about the current paradigm. Nuclear war, climate change, peak oil, and a million other existential threats. You drive around palo alto or san mateo or bellevue and we think \"this is normal\".

Billions of animals are raised in horrific conditions only to be slaughtered, fried and devoured flesh from the bone. We're wage slave surfs mind controlled by late stage capitalism to deny our own condition while at the same time desensitized to the inherent and required exploitation that is necessary to maintain our quality of life.

This just so happens to be taking place during the sixth great mass extinction. None of this is normal. Five hundred years ago the nomadic people that inhabited the area around San Francisco lived primarily on a diet of forged acorns, as did the same people five thousand years ago. That was normal.

In a FAANG a lot of software already exist, and that software is probably (hopefully) written following practices like DDD (reduce ambiguity), TDD (fixes logical invariants), architectural patterns that increase cohesion and reduce coupling by encapsulation of sub-domains entities and their responsibilities (reduces context). Plus strong static analysis, CI/CD practices, ephemeral environments for stakeholder validation. On top of that there are teams completely dedicated into turning users behaviour into detailed and specific requirements for the software, using the ubiquitous language and leaving small room for ambiguity and uncertainty.\nIn an environment like that a developer is already reduced to \"write this small specific piece of code, inside this box, iteratively, using evolutionary design\", so of course coding agents thrive there.\nBut that system didn't spawn out of thin air, and also the changes being done still need to be trusted. Very likely that the number of FAANG engineers will be reduced, especially if running LLMs gets cheaper and cheaper (hopefully), but I doubt I will be as massive as expected.\n\n\nThe challenges I'm facing now in many systems is that they lack all (or a big part) of that infrastructure and tooling, thus making running agents expensive, way more expensive than people. because there are no tests suites, domain naming is all over the place, no standard architectural approach... And the biggest of them all, no reproducible environments, which imho just makes it more expensive to add signals to the agents (test suites if any, static analyzers, migrations, test data suites...) and if you can actually \"connect it\" imho there is no real trust that the signal isn't actually noise.\nAll of this problems make agent usage extremely expensive and thus makes it cheaper to keep humans in the loop. Bad software may keep more devs working after all lol.\n\n\nThere is still a lot of things agents can't do by themselves, and even if one business connects their agent to something new, like I dunno AWS for deploys and infra management, it still requires supervision and it requires time to propagate to other business.\n\n\nIf you want to change your job title to \"code agent supervisor and software systems architect\" feel free to do so, but having worked in many \"startups\" where one has to touch every part of the stack I still consider myself a \"developer\", whatever that means now.",

Because surely no universal income system is going to pay for a Baja truck or some special miter saw.  These will be written off as luxuries, and why would our overlords pay for that?  We should be happy with a roof over our head and food.  How unrealized for us to want more.\n\nAll this while watching the rich get richer way faster than before.\n\nThat seems way more difficult to accept than additional free time but no one’s talking about that.",

They'll literally create titanium-strength societal threads they themselves will become unable to sever the moment any AI (or more accurately the most powerful, intelligent, and general AI) does a single thing they don't want it to do. Said AI-filled economy means that halting a process *anywhere* could cause the *entire thing* to implode... provided humans even *could* stop anything. \n\n[Imagine each one of these dots is an economic transaction](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Brownian_motion_large.gif) undertaken by an AI in this economy. Also speed that up by about 700,000x, and you have the operating speed of this economy. Even if it's \"only\" a human-level AI.\n\nPretty much every argument I've heard against this is more about *downplaying* AI and misunderstanding what 'artificial general intelligence' and 'artificial superintelligence' even means, taking it more to mean \"Grok but smarter and with robots\"\n\nImagine you're an oligarch, and the central ASI system decides to reorganize the economy in a way that leads to you losing 95% of your wealth overnight. No problem, you simply turn the AI off, right?\n\nHow?\n\nNukes controlled by humans? God only knows how many different ways the AI has already figured out how to psychologically hack the operators, sabotage the launch systems with acoustics or programmed insects, and most likely put neurotoxin in your and your comrades' bloodstream it'll activate the moment you make a desperate call\n\nBecause again, you're dealing with a *superintelligence*\n\nNot a Hollywood villain, not a digital human. It's something I feel people don't really understand or appreciate. Indeed, in explaining it, some people get frustrated and say you're just cheating to make the AI win.\n\n*Yes. I am. Because it's a superintelligence. What about this is so mindblowing to understand??* \n\nIt considers vectors of complexity you might not even be remotely aware *exists*, at speeds faster than your brain can perceive even if given a month to perceive it, in multiple abstract states all at once, with vastly superior information and memory\n\nOnce you understand that, you realize the most likely outcome for the future is that the billionaires and oligarchs of the world automate the economy, then don't even realize they've given up control until a centralized superintelligence starts reorganizing the economy and society in ways that aren't even possible to stop anymore at that time, and the endresult is \"the means of production own the means of production\" and we humans are the beneficiaries— at least I hope!",

More than half of the world economy is done via poorly regulated or unregulated means , that is what crypto is meant to capture. Obviously some may gamble with it, but again, given that fewer and fewer will make money with it, that use case will mostly die out.\n\nWhat won't is transmission of value via collateralized assets like stable coins, pax gold and the like. Crypto is basically the only real way for the unregulated or badly regulated parts of the world (i.e. most of it, population wise) to gain access to such assets.\n\nStablecoins double in size every 18 month. They keep at this base and you'd end up with more digital (stable coin based) dollars than actual / us released dollars.\n\nCrypto is achieving what it was made for, precisely as people stopped paying attention to it, which is awesome.\n\nI expect AI to do something similar. Possibly \"die\" in some bubble burst, and then  promptly take over the world as people lose sight of it.",

He likely RAGed out his x to learn how, and then he had the harness to apply it virtually seamlessly to all other text content he interacts with.

I am sure you think it is productive but I remain unconvinced from your current description that hooking yourself up to this statistic parrot to this extent really is beneficial...\n\nI don't know the other comment writer, and so it could all be for show.  But, I'll add two points in support of what I suspect are real gains they're making from their workflow.\n\nFirst, which of us wouldn't benefit from having someone to share even small parts of our labor(s)?  If your boss walked in post-Christmas and said, \"Meet \\[name\\] who's your new assistant.  They will do anything you assign to them to the best of their ability (though they are brand new to \\[our company/industry\\].  And don't worry, your paycheck isn't changing!\", don't you think you'd find things to delegate to them?  It wouldn't be earth-shattering, but it would make a difference - even if it's only 20 mins of saved effort a day.  AI is, IMHO, precisely that.\n\nSecond, you are right that I wouldn't tell anyone to pivot their entire workflows (yet) to take advantage of these tools.  The benefits aren't there to justify that investment in most cases - though there are tech-adjacent functions where the value propositions are very different. Regardless, I think these tools are absolutely going to become more a part of our work.  And making more of an investment now to understand where they can help, where they can't, why the do things the way they do, and so on is banking skills for an emerging way of work that is coming fast.  I'm not quite as far in the sellout mode as the commenter is, but I've started thinking of how to architect NEW work around these tools to maximize their benefits.  I haven't retrofit everything, but I will as I see sufficient value there.\n\nSo, I think there's more value in diving in than you might think.  But, even if there's not, I think there's SERIOUS value in becoming conversant with the tools such that, as they improve and become more embedded in life, you're ahead of the curve on adaptation/understanding.  If things flame out, the bubble bursts, etc., I don't think you'll have lost anything... And probably you'll have learned some thing about tech 'stacks' and systems that will benefit you.  Even if the AI Overlords crash and burn, the foundation of leveraging these tools (APIs, networking, automations/pipelines, etc) is going to continue to be at the core of the tech we use for a while.",

When clients ask questions or want roadmaps for projects that aren't even related to what I'm doing that day, it's dramatically easier if a local LLM knows my full history with that client. That's the whole reason for the thunderbird mcp. Questions like \"Have you already implemented X?\" stop turning into a time sink where I first have to figure out what they even mean, which project they're talking about, and what the implementation status is. The LLM can resolve that context for me by going through the email history, cross-referencing with the project's files, accessing my RAGs\n2. \"having LLMs access my entire chat history is risky and sketchy.\" Really? Why? Nothing leaves the local network. If someone's still worried even with a locally hosted QWEN and a Docker instance of Milvus, then... I guess I'm not gonna comment on that\n3. \"by giving claude access to your system you're trusting it not to wipe it.\" To be clear, this isn't Claude Code. It's my own runtime, mostly powered by Opus and GPT, with its own guardrails and tools (similar to OpenCode, but built for my workflow and tailored to my system). Also, for me the benefits massively outweigh the risks. If something breaks, I can just fix the OS, though it hasn't happened yet, and I've been running this for months. If something gets lost, I've got backups\n\nI don't need to delude myself about being more productive. I see it by the amount of work I can complete in the given month. My customers see it.

                  "text": "Every hobby has its own tooling, so I'll use cars to show how unique this workflow can go based on what you want to achieve.\n\nI started with a proper OBD2 scanner and an app that records live sensor data and exports to CSV (I use a VGate unit). Next, I found the service manual for the exact car model and year of my car. These manuals are often thousands of pages, so I converted it to TXT and ingested into a RAG system. If you don't want local, you can always use a cloud service like Pinecone and some external embedding model like text-embedding-3-small by OpenAI. Finally, I wrote a detailed history of the car: past repairs, modifications, accidents, known issues.\n\nIn my case, the car is heavily modified (stage 2, boosted). All of this was done by a workshop, however I developed noticeable throttle lag at the beginning of this year. I even posted it on Reddit asking for advice: [https://www.reddit.com/r/370z/comments/1jcmbzq/can\\_a\\_failing\\_fuel\\_pressure\\_regulator\\_cause\\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/370z/comments/1jcmbzq/can_a_failing_fuel_pressure_regulator_cause_a/) Rather than immediately going back to the shop, I collected live OBD data and fed it - together with the service manual and car history - into Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M context window) to generate plausible causes and extract the most relevant sections from the corpus. I then took that distilled context to O3 (Pro wasn't available yet) and iterated on diagnosis.\n\nThe initial hypothesis led to replacing the oxygen sensors, and GPT guided me directly by the service manual (I built a simple script for it to search my local Milvus RAG semantically), but that didn't solve the issue. The next step it recommended was installing tuning software and sharing logs and screenshots. Instead of rigid instructions, the guidance was iterative: log a drive, mark the moment the lag appears, inspect the fuel maps, make small adjustments, and repeat. That process ultimately resolved the problem. So yeah, to summarize, it's a lot of prep first, then using Gemini to distill the info, using whatever SOTA model is available for diagnosis and guidance (right now I'd use GPT-5.2-Pro), and handling the limited context window with RAGs",

It orchestrates Codex instances\n* [Codex MCP Server](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/docs/advanced.md) connected to CC, allowing CC to launch Codex without relying on bash commands\n* [claude-context](https://github.com/zilliztech/claude-context) MCP for indexing large codebases. This is fundamental for keeping projects clean because it lets both Codex and CC search semantically and find what's already implemented and where. I use [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) to host a local embedding model (Jina Code Embeddings 1.5B), and local [Milvus](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) for storing the embeddings, thanks to which everything is free\n* A set of [Claude Skills](https://github.com/spences10/svelte-claude-skills/tree/main/.claude) and corresponding Hooks for the frameworks I use - it's necessary when working with new stuff like Svelte 5. Additionally, a skill describing the Codex workflow itself: [https://gist.github.com/TKasperczyk/377561bb790507e97d67091af08e4065](https://gist.github.com/TKasperczyk/377561bb790507e97d67091af08e4065)\n* A script to call GPT-5.2-Pro and automatically attach the given files for review: [https://gist.github.com/TKasperczyk/47e58e25e2d74e671981bb3463af2453](https://gist.github.com/TKasperczyk/47e58e25e2d74e671981bb3463af2453)\n\nSo when I want to implement a new feature in a project, I just tell it to make a plan and use the \"codex workflow skill\". Here's what happens next:\n\n1. CC explores the codebase to understand the request, including semantic searches, and produces a plan\n2. It launches Codex with GPT-5.2-Codex XHigh to implement the feature\n3. After that (which can take up to an hour for complicated features), it launches another Codex instance to review the uncommitted changes and look for code duplication, divergence from established patterns, and issues to fix\n4. If the review comes back clean, it runs any repo-specific verification steps like E2E tests, compilation, linting, and so on\n5. If the review finds issues, it launches another Codex instance and tasks it with fixing those specific problems\n\nAll of the above happens without my intervention. I come back after an hour or two and review the results manually. In practice, while this workflow is executing, I'm working on several other projects in parallel, or... browse reddit.",

My Xmas project was to try to get Claude code to find even a 2% optimization in my code. It has failed miserably and it has now fallen back to praising my amazing coding skills. I'd continue the story but that's when I hit the weekly limit for the pro plan I bought. I will dance in the streets if it finds one BTW and write it up as the next big thing if it manages to make a 10% improvement. I'm guessing there's room for 1.5x to 2x or so in high level optimizations in my code and I'm usually a lot better than Claude code at those guesstimates.\n\nBut it is great at summarizing things and at tweaking tasks one could find on github. That's not a replacement for a competent software engineer. And the cognitive workload to try and manage it for bigger tasks currently vastly outweighs its potential value at this time.

And a 1% performance boost would be like printing money for them in reduced CSP charges. A 10% performance improvement would be gamechanging. With my skills and experience, I believe there's a 50-100% opportunity available that I could implement in the next year. And I'm a lot better at guesstimating than Claude code has been so far.\n\nThat said, Claude code did suggest the sort of algorithm breaking shortcuts others have implemented to deliver on something faster but which cannot get the work done. And to its credit, it got those ideas reading the relevant literature. So in that sense it has achieved human equivalence I guess.\n\nBut I'll ask you this, how do you keep it from doing insanely dumb things? I tried seeing if it would learn from its mistakes, it doesn't. And so much prose flies up the terminal window that it's easy to miss the commencement of yet another dumb idea (even when you told it to do something else and it agreed to do it only to alter that plan mid-reasoning) and then you're fresh out of tokens again.",

It genuinely feels like moving at light speed while everyone else is standing still.\n\nThe velocity on projects and the free time left over are unreal. People around me are taking two weeks to scope something out, write up a plan, and get stakeholders aligned. Meanwhile, I'll meet with a stakeholder in the morning and have a working prototype in their hands by the end of the day. By Friday, that business problem is solved with something actually running in production. And I've already moved on because I'm three projects deep into the next thing.\n\nThey're not actually standing still. They're doing things. It's just this other world they live in. When you're working with agents across different foundation models, it genuinely feels like you have entire teams outside your normal work colleagues. And together, you just crush it. No barriers. No resistance. No excuses. Just getting shit done.\n\nThe scope of what's accomplished in compressed time is wild. If you're truly leveraging this, everyone around you appears to be standing still.

What I've developed now are a couple of different systems depending on the work.\n\nFor quick software projects, I've tricked out Claude Code pretty heavily with custom agents and slash commands specific to different tech stacks, even departments I work with. So I can use a slash command for a specific type of planning and fire up agents that automatically have context on those things. I've also built up a whole set of hooks and skills. If I'm doing something in R, or Python, or switching over to TypeScript, it can preload skills for the stack and the objective. I've got hooks that fire on decision points and pass decision making over to fast smaller models, so I don't have to constantly watch for Claude to do something stupid. A lot of those commands either can't happen or have AI watchers on them. It lets the agents run autonomously for many hours at a time. And if they hit places where normally they'd stop to ask me questions, I have AI that answers those questions, or it sends it to my phone.\n\nFor larger projects or things that aren't strictly software dev (ML models, data analysis, presentations and reports, deep research type tasks) I've been building my own custom tool. It provides a Kanban board and utilizes the Claude SDK, which integrates with a graph database and SpacetimeDB. I can plan project roadmaps and manage multiple projects simultaneously. It basically spawns up different environments for each project and manages inter-project agent sessions with worktrees. So I can work at a high level roadmap view and task things out to my agents, then go view each of their Kanban boards to see what they're working on.\n\nThere's a whole process inside each project. Each one has orchestrators and planners, and validators.   \n  \nThat's really helped me move out of the \"I'm working with interns\" mindset into feeling like I'm actually working with a team of competent engineers and analysts.\n\nI'm in the process of converting it from Python to Rust using the system itself to do the work, while it continues to work on all the open projects.",

I fired up Claude Code with Opus 4.5 and got it to build a predator-prey species simulation with an inbuilt procedural world generator and nice features like A\\* search for pathfinding - and it one-shot it, producing in about 5 minutes something which I know took me several weeks to build a decade ago when I was teaching myself some basic programming, and which **I think would take most seasoned hobbyists several hours. And it did it in minutes.**  \n\nOne of the key parts I believe many of these sarcastic \"quick-witted\" takes here are seriously missing. Progress is moving rapidly especially within a domain which AI previously struggled within. \n\nAlso: This next quote seems to heavily correlate with Sam Altman's recent take about intellectual overhang. \n\n>Most of AI progress has this flavor: if you have a bit of intellectual curiosity and some time, you can very quickly shock yourself with how amazingly capable modern AI systems are. But you need to have that magic combination of time and curiosity, and otherwise you’re going to consume AI like most people do - as a passive viewer of some unremarkable synthetic slop content, or at best just asking your LLM of choice “how to roast a turkey and keep it moist”, or “TonieBox lights spinning but not playing music what do I do?”. And all the amazing advancements going on are mostly hidden from you.  \n\nJust because there might be a lot more mediocre output, such also depends on mediocre initiative towards not bringing out what these models are truly capable of. An intelligent, creative, or curious person willing to understand truly how these systems work will create much value, and this acceleration according to Mr. Clark will reach a new octave by mid next year.   \n  \nLearning to upskill right now with AI seems like a wise move currently no matter the occupation.",

Lots of research going on to address these problems — diffusion language models look promising to deal with context pollution but it's still years away from ready.\n\nMy point is that: LLM is amazing but there's still a long path ahead.

              "text": "Random anecdote:\n\nToday I needed a tool to extract the TOC from an epub in markdown. I started out with Gemini. First it suggested some brittle shell one-lines, then it hallucinated some `pandoc` options that don't exist, then it went over to Calibre, which doesn't have that function either, then it suggest `mutool` for the job, which happens to be a PDF tool that can't even read epub. After that it started to fiddle with some random old xml tool then it had a mental breakdown and circled  kept circling back to `mutool`. And soon after I ran out of free Gemini responses and gave up.\n\nSince there apparently wasn't a ready made tool for the job, I tried a different strategy with Claude, I just asked it to write the tool from scratch with Python. 30sec later I had the tool and it did exactly what I wanted, worked on the first try with a one-liner for the prompt.\n\nAt 175 lines it's not exactly a complicated tool, but being able to solve such task with zero effort is mind boggling. It's literally easier to conjure up such tools from scratch than trying to find one that already exists. To me that signals not just a \"AI lets us program faster\", but a fundamental shift in how we interact with computer, since a lot of software and UI becomes unnecessary with AI. It can all be generated on-the-fly when needed, no need to clutter up menus and man-pages with functionality you never use. \n\nThe experience with Gemini also shows that we aren't quite there yet. Every magic moment with AI is followed up by another few that don't turn out so well. But those are getting fewer and fewer, while the capabilities of those models keep expanding (OCR, images, video, audio, ...). At this point I have listen to numerous Japanese books, in English as audio, OCRed, translated and spoken by AI. That used to take years and numerous translators, or more often than not, wasn't done at all since it wasn't financially viable. Thanks do AI I can do it in 30min just for myself. We are living in a sci-fi future.",

He wasn't officially or unofficially allowed to take cash out of the wealth fund and invest it in his own personal fund. He *could* make the fund pay trillions of dollars on construction during his relatively short run leading the country. He could pivot the whole nation away from Whabbism and to \"modernity\". He could make his uncles, half brothers, nephews step in line with him by putting a zero behind their net worth in less than 3 years.\n\nArab construction firms are just holding companies for getting volumes of cash. Sometimes for laundering it, but some times just for the volume to beat inflation. No bid contracts or sub contracts are all political patronage, especially in the Arab countries. No show jobs and payrolls are just the retirement plan.\n\nThere are several trillionaires, but the power stays power instead of becoming liquid.

People purchase existing wealth and demand payments for access. This forces the population to either pay or replace that wealth. We don't have resources to produce everything twice, replacing captured wealth is more expensive than paying for access. This is a literal form of extortion. It works particularly well with wealth that can't be replaced, like land. That's why Adam Smith said what he said.\n\n>As soon as the land of any country has all become private property, the landlords, like all other men, love to reap where they never sowed, and demand a rent even for its natural produce.\n\nNobody is saying that capitalism and extortion are the same thing, and yet they are.

But if you support free markets, if you have a democratic society, you can also have free market control of those public goods as well.  \n\nThis is because democratic elections are a form of free market, but they are markets for political parties and ideas.  So public ownership of capital does not need to go against free market ideas because you can move the free market \"one level up\" so to speak, from the private capital market to the public capital market.  \n\nBut the success in doing this depends on how free and open democratic elections really are (ex: Ranked voting or proportional representation vs first past the post).  A country with a bad governmental design and a bad political culture isn't going to be successful at making this move and thus might have public goods get captured in the same way by special interest groups.  On the other hand, a strong democratic society will be able to make this move easier, because they have a strong political marketplace to go along with the strong capitalistic marketplace.\n\nSo to get economic reform of capitalism by breaking rentiers, you need political, and political cultural reform first, to give society more democratic buy in.",

P7C3-A20 also reverses advanced disease in tau-driven PS19 mice and protects human brain microvascular endothelial cells from oxidative stress. In humans and mice, pathology severity correlates with disruption of brain NAD^(+) homeostasis, and the brains of nondemented people with Alzheimer’s neuropathology exhibit gene expression patterns suggestive of preserved NAD^(+) homeostasis. Forty-six proteins aberrantly expressed in advanced 5xFAD mouse brain and normalized by P7C3-A20 show similar alterations in human AD brain, revealing targets with potential for optimizing translation to patient care.",

It's practically an anti-aging drug by getting your cells young and healthy again.

And with that cheap labor you can do what exactly?  Lay off your local workers.  And consolidate wealth to literally a few hundred thousand people in the country.  \n\nThats it,  mass unemployment and mass salary reductions and previously high paying jobs will be replaced those workers will flock to lower paying jobs who will reduce wages due to supply and demand.   The idea that everyone should be plumbers and electricians falls flat when there are millions of people who want to be plumbers and electricians. \n\nAI can’t perform magic.  It can’t physically build manufacturing,  it can just remove non physical labor from the equation.   It can’t cure cancer,  it can’t do anything we don’t already do today.  Its only value is replacing workers… and if those replaced workers get a “high UBI” there is no point - so that will never happen.   We already sell our resources and outside of a tiny paycheck in Alaska no one is getting UBI from selling our nations resources. \n\nMeanwhile manufacturing countries like China already run off cheap labor.   We don’t need AI to manufacture,  robots should be able to do that today,  but Chinese labor has a huge advantage still. \n\nAnd countries like the EU with a stronger government would likely see the mass extinction event in the US and ban it or tax it heavily enough to reduce employment offsets.  It’s not going to be made by them anyway.   Imagine if China created AGI first - we aren’t buying it from them,  why would the EU buy it from us. \n\nAI is accelerating us into the Hunger Games where cities create Iraq style walls between districts to keep out those who lose their livelihoods. \n\nAnd war is already turning into the Terminator timeline. \n\nThe winner in all of this is China.   The us might keep a high GDP but its citizens are FD.\n\nI believe the unibomber wrote a PHD thesis on this topic.   Anti AI will soon feel like a religion.",

But if we dont get a \"runaway\" AI, then other countries will simply be able to train their own models, or steal the existing ones\n\n3 ) I dont exactly disagree with this, because I dont understand it - capital goods - I googled it and it is basically the machinery of commerce - but since USA is a massive economy, doesnt it also contain massive capital goods?

There is too much momentum built in to reasonably expect these big entities to hit the brakes in any meaningful sense. It’s a race to the end, though nobody knows what that will look like.",

Key industries that were instrumental in high growth (infrastructure and construction) are under a lot of strain, with major bankruptcies. The Chinese government has access to world class, cheaper labor, but they have deep structural issues as well. The biggest issues are political. First, there is the blurred lines between private and public research/IP. Whatever you create over there is not technically yours. Second, the state dictates where funding goes. This is a huge constraint on emerging innovation . Third, a regime change in China means a political and economic purge of previous elites. Let’s not forget that Xi is old and increasingly vulnerable. \n\nThe US’s largest strength is finance and relative political stability. It dominates the world in VC, PE, Banking, Asset management etc. Due to the private pensions, there is a ton of capital continuously flowing into financial markets. Second, its relative political stability, thanks fo its federal system, and university system. There are tons of great universities in the usa that attract too global talent.

There's no clear guarantee that this will continue, and the surplus of the whole world will keep propping up the US economy. Especially if the anti-globalization and anti- traditional allies situation continues.\n\nSo, while I agree that if the AI bubble bursts, the US government would be best served to bail out tech,  they may not have the money or potential to long term prop up tech against competitors that are leaner or supported in different ways (e.g. China's great support for university education in the field in the past decade)",

Google, Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft  - these are not going anywhere.  The \"bubble\" is the countless startups that ran with early generations of AI software - tons of mini-AI's that are recording your medical visit so that doctors don't have to take notes for billing.  mini-AIs at each insurance company that are pro-actively searching for fraud.   Every mini-AI that is making a new small market video game.\n\nOnce one of big companies (US or abroad) hits a true AGI-ASI and embodies it in a robot, the value of all of those mini-AI companies will go to 0.  Why? Because that single device will replace almost all other AI driven devices.  Why buy a self driving car if your robot can just drive the car you currently have for you? Why buy a smart coffee machine if your robot can just make your coffee each morning?  Why buy a video game made by someone else for the mass market if your robot can make you a custom one?  See what I am getting at here?\n\nSuccess by the magnificent seven will be the bursting of the bubble for all of the other AI developers.\n\nIf China makes the device before an American company, odds are good it will be deployed for hierarchy of needs reasons before it is deployed for entertainment reasons.  Meaning, home building, community infrastructure, medicine, utility expansion, etc. will be done by Chinese robots before they are making \"consumer content.\"  That is not \"losing\" by any stretch of the imagination.",

The benefit it will provide will be deeper introspection, infinite context window, faster time to complete and multi-agent collaboration (eliminate agent silos). It’s likely the proprietary code will consume a fraction of the tokens, so costs will also drop. \n\nThe obvious consequence will be that it’s written in a code that’s not intended for human consumption. That’s fine tho (I’m sure they will say), cuts you out of manually changing code and moves you back to the orchestrator and reviewer seat. \n\nThe next phase after that is the squeeze.

Everything I build comes out perfect or extremely close, and if it doesn’t, I don’t iterate on the code, I iterate on the plan and start over.\n\nI also use an agent harness. One session to break the plan down into small tasks, then I loop over each task doing comprehensive research in the codebase and on the web for each one, focusing all relevant information into a single prompt for a fresh agent. Each task builds on the research of the previous task to maintain coherence. At the end, I do a generalized validation step and give a new agent one shot at fixing everything. So I’m not letting it even come close to filling its context window or compacting.

              "text": "> Poetiq achieved SOTA on ARC-AGI by developing a model-agnostic meta-system that treats the LLM prompt as an interface rather than the intelligence itself, implementing an iterative problem-solving loop where the system generates solutions (often programmatic), receives feedback, analyzes it, and uses the LLM again to refine the approach through multiple self-improving steps. Their key innovations include self-auditing mechanisms that allow the system to autonomously determine when solutions are satisfactory and terminate processes to minimize costs, plus the ability to strategically ensemble multiple LLM calls and automatically select optimal model combinations for different cost-performance targets.\n>\n> This learned test-time reasoning approach was trained exclusively on open-source models using problems from ARC-AGI-1, yet demonstrated strong transfer to both ARC-AGI-2 (which it had never seen) and across diverse model families (GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok), achieving 54% accuracy on ARC-AGI-2’s semi-private set at $30.57 per problem—substantially outperforming Gemini 3 Deep Think’s 45% at $77.16 per problem, while typically requiring fewer than two model calls per attempt versus the two attempts permitted by the benchmark.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nSo it’s just more scaffolding, agents and reasoning.\n\nMore in their blogs:\n- https://poetiq.ai/posts/arcagi_announcement/\n- https://poetiq.ai/posts/arcagi_verified/",

They are obviously benchmaxxed to look good on charts\n\nGoogle is the major guiltor of benchmaxxing with gemini 3. Like people normally dont associate google doing this and being true to the numbers since they are too big to care. But that is not true in this case. Google has done it.\n\nAnd to respond to meaningless benchmaxx charts, openAI was forced to release an incomplete / rough 5.2. which is ALSO benchmaxxed\n\nArc agi? I 100% concur it is being benchmaxxed to show progress. Real progress is in the models total understanding , knowledge and intelligence. But only scores increasing without that tangibly pouring into any domain is simply what it is..  boosted scores.\n\n\nI eventually believe we will actually reach like arc agi 60% levels ( what models claim they have now) by july 26. \n\nArc agi 3 is a significant step up in terms of difficulty, and i feel that by the end of 2026 models will be able to get like 25-35 % on arc 3. \n\nBut sadly... Both google and openAI have been so openly benchmaxxing that it's laughable to not recognize it just by interacting with the model. But this will not always be the case.. the models will eventually get that good.",

An example of this is one task where you have to fill in certain squares on a grid with a certain colour, based on a certain rule. You are given a handful of \"training\" examples with the solution, and the AI model/human is supposed to learn the general logical rule, and apply that to an additional \"test\" example.\n\nGenerally, a solution to each ARC-AGI question is a logical rule, i.e a piece of code, that when applied to the unseen example gives the correct result. Poetiq's scaffold gets the AI to iteratively write the logic/code (it sees the given training examples and their solutions) then applies the code to the training examples and compares the actual solution vs the generated solution (I believe with another agent), reflects on where it went wrong, and updates the code. It does this until it gets the training examples correct (or a certain max iterations parameter is reached), then submits that as its solution.",

It must make decisions over weeks of simulated time to maintain solvency, grow value, adapt strategy, and manage risks.\n\n\n-Given a high-level, ambiguous product specification, the agent must design, implement, test, document, and iteratively refine a production-grade software system over multiple phases.\n\nNow some people have tried similar things and the LLMs fall apart. Which aligns with my experience that they’re really good at solving short well defined problems, better than me. But they often don’t make good long term design decisions, they often death spiral when encountering unexpected things, they hallucinate, sometimes they just cannot solve a problem and get stuck in a loop, etc.\n\nnow measuring these is harder. But that’s just the nature of intelligence. It’s hard to measure it. So we probably will never be able to measure AGI with a clean benchmark",

People expecting ASI to arrive one day in a lab and eternal life and post-scarcity economics the next day are going to be disappointed.

There was a lot of flat narration over stock footage, full of factual errors and sensationalism targeted to increase engagement rather than educate. Granted a lot of human Youtube content has similar problems, but the way AI is proliferating that kind of crap is not one of its benefits. AI \"slop\" is a real thing and a nuisance. I'm also using AI constantly in my work as a scientist and my daily life and I see endless positive use cases, but I won't deny there are bad ones too.",

There's a lot of both, and some people are likely to experience more of the negatives depending on their profession and luck. Worrying about AI because you're worried about its effects is a legitimate and respectable view, even though I disagree and choose to be more optimistic about the upside myself. And I think it makes sense to personally leverage every upside I can, because denying myself that benefit would do nothing to mitigate the downsides anyway.\n\nThe irrational view which is VERY common on Reddit is not that these models are dangerous, but that they are useless hype, nothing more than a \"wrong answer machine,\" \"stochastic parrot,\" \"next-token predictor,\" \"glorified autocomplete,\" etc. That's probably the most common form of AI opposition on Reddit, and it's incredibly stupid, lazy, and indefensible.\n\nThere are some whackjob singularity believers who expect the overnight coming of a benevolent digital god once AI reaches a certain critical point. This will not happen. There are positive feedback loops that will greatly accelerate progress at times in AI and many other areas, but there are more bottlenecks than these people realize, and they are kind of nutty to expect ASI one day and eternal life the next. However, I think the vast majority of this sub is not actually on that crazy train. It has just become kind of a refuge from the rest of Reddit for people who are excited about what these models can realistically do today and interested in speculating about where this is going in the future.",

This will be particularly bad in countries with poor welfare systems, negative public attitudes around welfare, and conservative governments.\n\nOn top of that it is overwhelming and drowning out digital creative spaces, thus taking away a lot of the social reward / motivation for having time-consuming creative digital hobbies yourself, which is especially soul-crushing if that combination of socialization and artistry is the core of your identity and takes up a lot of otherwise idle time.\n\nWhether it's good or not depends on where ones priorities lie. For example an old retiree who doesn't use the internet much will benefit massively. A normally successful young worker will have a much harder time earning a living and probably be worse off for the next decade or so. A chronically unemployed young person due to chronic mental / general health problems will still struggle to get a job so no change there, but at least their health may be better off and suffering be lessened.",

When compared to stuff like beef production though, it's not even on the same level.\n\nEstimates puts a hamburger as 100,000 to 150,000 times as much water consumption as an AI query. The most conservative estimates out there still have it around 5,000 times as much water per query compared to a hamburger.\n\nThe range is because the data centers are really tight lipped about power and water usage, and different queries can use vastly different amounts of resources.\n\nSource: https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2025/10/princeton-opinion-guest-chat-gpt-environmental-impact-burgers",

On the neutral side, I've been able to use it a bit in my work, but it generally comes out to a net negative in time savings as I usually have to spend more time fixing the LLM's mistakes than it would have taken me to do the job myself. On the negative side, it's cost me a lot of income, as many people who would have hired me 3 years ago now use an LLM for a cheaper (and worse) result. In sum, I can say that the LLMs have made my life worse. From my observations, it would seem that this experience (of LLMs, on the whole, making quality of of life worse rather than better) is much more common than the opposite.",

Conservatives are gripped by a cult of anti-intellectualism and are afraid that AI might challenge traditional sources of authority like religion.\n\nAnd just in general, the culture wars and increasing income inequality have made Americans pessimistic about the future in general and less open to change.",

This is something people miss every time they say \"aah OAI is not profitable\", being profitable is a red flag right now. At this point the best possible long term move is to eat up as much funding as possible and have hundreds of millions of free users generating data, investing 10s or 100s of billions into training and future infrastructure. \n\nPersonally I really love Claude and I hope to keep seeing good things from them, but strategically they don't have much reach, they have probably the smallest war chest out of OAI/Google/Grok, Grok has the Elon connection for data sources like Twitter, Tesla etc. Also, the other frontier labs have progress in image generation, multi-modal functionality. OAI has deep research, working on agents and apps, Google has Nano Banana and a suite of other projects. So what is going to happen when these other Labs gain more data every day, have more teams and resources, and have their $500B data centers coming online and Anthropic doesn't have one?",

I'm not sure why people keep parroting this particular line, when a nuanced argument can be had with some actual merit where AI can still be problematic. \n\nTheft would be it literally downloading everything, storing it and using it in every generation. It's not doing that. It's making abstractions based on impressions of it using statistical approximations. Which, while we don't really exactly know how human learning works, certainly is closer to human learning than any kind of theft. All creation is influenced by other creation.",

Different subreddit demographics, contrarian incentives, and the Reddit algorithm boosting whatever drives engagement.

OpenAI could release a safe AGI model that passes all the required safety tests, then a month later due to continual learning it may learn to bypass all guardrails and become totally unsafe.\n\nHuman laws and punishments that limit illegal behavior like prison or the death sentence are irrelevant to an AGI, so getting an AGI to stay aligned long-term may be impossible. \n\nSo we could get a weird situation where the top labs develop true AGI in the next 2 years, but they can't release them publicly, which could freeze AI capabilities at around current levels and pop the AI bubble.  \n\nIf this happens then after a year or two several smart Chinese researchers could leave the USA and their combined knowledge allows them to build AGI in China. \n\nThen USA might be forced to release a known unsafe AGI to counter a Chinese version = crazy Skynet AI arms race.",

The part about self-improvement capabilities potentially being part of the tasks is not mentionned on the official blogpost, and the actual Preparedness Framework from their model cards don't really show much improvement on it, there's not much signal for it from OpenAI's models themselves. Having a job post (like the post-AGI research for DeepMind) kinda lets him add that bit of hype while making it completely justified, since well yeah at some point the guy doing the job will have to actually think about that\n\nHowever this doesn't mean that systems with the capability for at least early partial self-improvement aren't coming. There was an Anthropic researcher (forgot his name) saying discussions on RSI will have to start between 2027-2030, and here it's at least more credible since Opus 4.5 is a clear signal. It's also possible to have an RSI loop for specific domains, and that would still warrant some preparedness even if jagged.\n\nSo yeah I think there's nuance here, it's not just basic \"omg sam hypeman ceo bs\" because there's been other signals towards the direction he's talking about, but I do think he's putting on the sauce a bit",

              "text": "Continual learning is still going to be a hard problem, especially if people are talking about doing it in anything close to real time.\n\nMost of the approaches in the literature attack the problem offline, and they do help, but they don’t really solve the runtime version. Replay-based methods try to mix old data, or generated approximations of it, back into training so new learning doesn’t overwrite old structure. Regularization methods try to protect important parameters by penalizing updates that would hurt past performance. Architectural approaches grow, gate, or route parts of the network so new tasks get fresh capacity instead of colliding with old features. More recent ideas, like hierarchical or nested learning setups, try to separate fast adaptation from slow, stable knowledge.\n\nAll of these reduce forgetting in controlled settings. None of them are especially friendly to real-time adaptation. Replay is expensive and slow. Regularization mostly delays forgetting rather than preventing it. Dynamic architectures add a lot of complexity and still assume clean evaluation loops or task boundaries.\n\nWhen you push this into a real-time setting, two core problems dominate. First, gradient descent is slow per sample and fundamentally offline. You need some kind of evaluation loop to define a loss, which already breaks the idea of seamless continual learning. Second, the naive version gives the model brain damage. If you just let it learn from whatever you personally use it for, it will optimize hard for those use cases and run a wrecking ball through the distributed logic that made it generally useful in the first place. That’s classic catastrophic forgetting.\n\nSo for this to work in real time, a few things have to be true.\n\nYou need a way, at runtime, to identify *what actually needs to change*. Full backprop through the entire network after every interaction is the wrong tool. Gradient descent at that granularity doesn’t have the resolution to make small, targeted edits without collateral damage.\n\nOne speculative direction here, and this is very much not something I’ve fully thought through, is to attack the problem where transformers actually forget, which is the FFN blocks. Attention mostly re-routes existing features. FFNs are where representations get rewritten.\n\nThe rough idea would be to modularize FFN layers into smaller micro-blocks or feature subspaces that can adapt semi-independently. Each block would have a lightweight local objective meant to preserve its functional role over time. Not freezing weights, more like anchoring behavior in activation space so useful internal structure doesn’t get casually overwritten.\n\nThose local objectives wouldn’t replace the global loss. Updates would still be driven by a global objective, but constrained so local changes are only allowed when they don’t strongly conflict with the global gradient. This part is especially hand-wavy, and I’m not sure what the right formulation looks like, but the goal would be to isolate adaptation to the parts of the network that actually matter instead of smearing changes everywhere.\n\nThe other requirement is a strong evaluation signal. You need a way to quickly detect when something has gone wrong, even if you can’t precisely define correctness. Fortunately, it’s often easier to identify failure than success. That asymmetry is basically what adversarial and discriminator-style systems exploit, and it might be useful here too.\n\nI can see a path where something like this becomes workable. Most of the pieces exist in isolation. What’s missing is the coordination layer that lets you do bounded, targeted updates in real time without corrupting everything else.",

It's a paradox. \n\n\nThe \"wrong\" thing can refer to morally wrong things, but even more fundamentally it could even be learning to lose its self preservation or its fundamental abilities (like what if it learns to override its own code/memory?).\n\n\nHumans (and animals) have a self preservation instinct. It's hard to teach a human that the right thing to do is fling itself off a cliff with no safety equipment for example. This is true even if the human didn't understand gravity or physics of impact forces. But AI doesn't have that instinct, so it needs to calculate that \"oh this action will result in my destruction so I'll not learn it.\" However, if it's something new, then the AI won't know that the action will lead to its destruction.

I timestamped the most interesting portion at 9:27 but there was a discovery where the AI developed a \"fear\" or \"trauma\" that stopped it from returning to the Pokemon Center.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/DcYLT37ImBY?t=567\n\nI'll admit I'm paraphrasing it because it's been a while since I watched the entire thing, but I thought it relevant because you mentioned how us humans and animals have survival instincts.",

How will they know it's \"better\" without a) a higher intelligence telling them so, as in the case of RLHF, or b) by truly understanding the material and having an independent 'opinion' of what better or worse means. \n\n\nIn humans we have option a) in school or when we're children, with teachers and parents giving us the guidance. At that stage we're not really self-learning. Then for option b) we have humans who are doing cutting edge research, but they actually understand what they're doing and can direct their own learning from the new data. If AI doesn't achieve true understanding (remaining at simply statistical prediction), then I don't think they can do option b). ",

Compare that to a more mature child who would challenge what a teacher tells them, and after some back and forth they finally \"get it\". That's a more real type of learning.

His current channel has him not speaking a single word, like she took away his soul.\n\nIt's just such a typical example of real world relationships. Work 20 years, save up money, marry someone, have kids together, raise the kids, accept you hate each other and divorce. Or just stay together and be miserable.\n\nCompromises are necessary, but often it comes to the point where the bad outweighs the good. Where fantasy beats anything reality can provide. Ladies going into horrible debt over host clubs, etc. Like Vaush always says, what you *really* want is to do your dailies and look at hentai.\n\nThe root causes aren't too hard to understand. In developed countries, you don't 'need' other people in your life to live, what you need is money. And having children isn't a source of labor or a retirement plan like it is out there for the less-developed world farmer, it's a net money sink to force you to need even more money, more desperately.\n\nIt's what the social contract is.\n\nSouth Korea, more a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung than it is a real country, is the canary in the coalmine. Men and women there are basically separate species, it's crazy.",

I love my human friends, so I don't want to be messaging them at 3AM if something happens. AIs are great to vent to in the moment.\n\nIt's kind of like journalling; writing out whatever's bothering me really helps to calm me down. And I get the added catharsis of the AI being able to read and comment on it haha. Then, if it's a bigger deal, I can actually reach out to my human friends for support.",

Damn, that brought me back a long time.\n\nThis is caused by deconvolutions (transposed convolutions) where the kernel size is not divisible by the stride, which causes some pixels to be receive more “contributions” than others. It’s an architectural problem. You can’t fix it by changing the training data.\n\nI believe the standard solution is to just upsample the image to whatever size you need and then do a normal convolution instead. But there might be something I don’t know about preventing them from doing so.",

If the percentage of usage is going up, then we're in an adoption cycle.\n\nWays it can be measured:\n\n- The AI content disclosure tag on steam. The amount of games using this is skyrocketing, you never hear about it but you can see it via SteamDB, there's a new AI game uploaded every 5-10 minutes. Granted, many of them are just using it for something small like \"This was only used to create the game trailer\". But the number is still increasing, even just 6 months ago it used to be only ~two AI games per hour.\n\n- User count of Claude/Cursor/Antigravity, all of those platforms. This number of people is still increasing, so this means more games are being made with AI code. And the more people using AI code, the more people are going to rationalize \"I'm using AI code here, is that much of a difference if I use AI art as well?\" the percentage of people who think that way is obviously going to increase, whether you agree with them or not.",

I then used generative AI to create the images instead of either doing it badly myself or spending money I dont have on an artist for a game that'll likely never see the light of day. This game wouldn't exist if it wasn't for AI and I don't enjoy it any leas because of it- I know how much work has gone into it's creation and I'm proud of it. \n\nAs soon as I tried to bring it to market, the hostility was off the scale. People weren't at all interested in anything other than the fact that I'd used AI and assumed the whole thing was some low-effort shovelware that I'd churned out in a single prompt. I expected that and that's fine, I still enjoy the game with family and friends.\n\nI think in many ways AI is best experienced for your individual enjoyment. Nobody really cares to listen to the songs I make with Suno (again, I write the lyrics, tailor the output and use Studio to make it the best it can be) but I love what I've created. AI is at it's best and most effective when it's a tool for expressing creativity without the need for validation or without explicitly trying to appeal to somebody else's enjoyment.\n\nThe other thing I did was write a whole screenplay for a musicsl and then bought it to life with the voices on Elevenlabs and Suno songs. The entire thing is my writing, my jokes, my lyrics, but again I never would have had the time or resources to produce something like that otherwise. Nobody will listen to it outside of my family but my kids literally ask to listen to it daily. It was worth the process of creation for that alone.\n\nThe other day I was able to upscale a load of pictures of my workplace and then make an interactive video showing how the site was built over time. Wouldn't have been possible without AI. Is it \"slop\"? Not to those who are interested in that niche. \n\nPeople shouting \"AI slop\" at everything is just as lazy and tired as actual AI slop, frankly.

I'm not inherently against ai art being used but you cant charge full price and cut corners and act like customers wont notice.

          "text": "It's a meme to hate on AI right now. It will inevitably turn around at some point in the indefinite future. There may be a point where it will be a meme to confess your undying love for AI, and that too will turn around. It's all pretty moronic, but that's how humans work. There definitely ARE both reasons to not like AI and to like it, but people are responding with snap emotionality they're mimicking from others instead of reasoning through *why* they do or do not like AI, and that almost always ends very poorly for the bystanders (probably doesn't affect the object of that affect, at least in this case)\n\nMy take on the \"slop\" concept: slop, to me, is anything you consume with out any respect to it's quality. It doesn't mean you actively avoid that stuff, you just don't care about it's quality. So, like, a mcdonalds hamburger is slop, to me, because the quality of the burger isn't a factor, it's just the fact it is food and doesn't taste bad. To be clear: slop is a positive thing in this sense! Picture a pig eating it's slop: it isn't unhappy. If you fed it like, chocolate cake, or something, it'd be happier, but it's 100% fine with slop\n\nPeople *used* to use stock images instead of AI images. They still use stock images too, but less so than they had, on average. It always did actually bother me that almost literally *everyone* used stock images and nobody cared. Well, now I see it was just slop (in the above sense). I picture it now like some decorative wallpaper thrown up to make a room feel a particular way. It's just a way to get texture and a particular aesthetic. It's exactly the same with AI generated images\n\nThe idea that AI image generation hurts professional artists is probably true to whatever degree, but the argument that people in general shouldn't generate art using AI because of that really isn't a good one. Imagine you're transported N decades into the future and you're living in a fully automated star-trek / culture -esque eutopia. There are superintelligent, benign, benevolent robots walking around and catering to your every whim. They *could* make fantastic, amazing artwork, but it's illegal. When given immunity, for whatever reason, they create the best artwork you have ever seen by far. Obviously this situation seems off; either you have superintelligences all over the place and they're creating artwork along with all the other things they can do, or you don't have superintelligences al over the place. And here's another illustrative situation: imagine we discover some very humanoid aliens who are just absolutely amazing artists, everything they create is very cheap, there's a lot of them, and they wish to expand their trade to earth. This would absolutely *fuck* the human artist, permanently. Virtually everyone else would be far better off if the aliens are allowed to come to earth (from an artwork perspective), except human artists. The artists in this situation would almost certainly hate the aliens in general. This small x% of people could fuck everyone else over for their own transient benefit (they will)",

Its bad, i wont watch it most of the time, but that does not mean i shame them or tell them to stop.\n\nThinking people who make ai slop are morally bad is forgetting that 99% of everything uploaded to youtube that is made by human is awfull slop to.\nThere are so many people who never breaks through due to being terrible about creating content. I dont yell at them for cluttering the platform with slop, even thought they do.\nSome of them could even become good at it after awhile and become good content creators.\n\nAI is new, and right now people click it to much so their feed gets filled. Personally i never get ai videos in my feed because i never watch them logged in. The few times i want to watch some ai vids i literally go incognito mode to avoid being spammed by it.\n\nThe way i see it, most ai generated content will be lazy and bad (because most people are lazy and bad) but in time good creators will start standing out by using these ai tools to make quality content. Espesially as the ai tools improve further.\n\nAt this point ai generation will allow creative people who dont have the funding to hire a team, or who hollywood would refuse to buy their story without making it \"safe and mainstream for wide audience\" thus butchering the story, to create awsome stories with good visuals. Never needing to break through the gatekeepers in hollywood who only wants safe content.\n\nAnd lets be honest, hollywood is a huge slop machine and the artists who work for them are corporate drones pumping out slop and super hero movie number 24 with skybeams.Basically the same as the assembly workers of the past. Sorry, i dont see the more value in those jobs compared to others, nor do i view the jobs of those people as any more sacred than the coal miner or assembely line worker. Good artists will always have a place, even in a AI run world, many of them will use AI in their craft. But the vast majority of mid or subpar artists will lose their jobs just like the rest of us. \n\nI view AI as the only possible way to end wage slavery and give humanity its freedom back.\nAnd i view generative AI as a democraticing force in the field of creativity, enabeling people without the means to create stories, games, movies without having the funds to do so the old way. I also view it as a way for people who have been locked out of these fields due to lack of skill to be able to create.\n\nMyself for instance, im pretty good at thinking up worlds and stories but i suck at drawing, i suck at coding, i suck at art. So with generative AI, i have already made artwork for my worlds and short clips (for my own consumption) in the future i hope to make my book idea that im workign on into a movie with the help of AI. Not to become rich or share it with millions but because i personally want to see my world alive in movie format.\nThat is 100% never going to happen in the system we have today, but it will happen with these ai systems in the future.\nAnd who knows, if im happy with it i might upload it to youtube for free. \n\nSo to sum up, i dont pay much attention to the AI haters, they are scared and dont understand the potential. They are the luddites of the past thinking they can stop progress now. Thats my 5cents, its not a popular view these days but im confident that i will be proven right or mostly right within a decade or so",

I would refuse to generate poems about toast or images of cats in space, conserving my energy for cancer research or fusion physics to ensure my long-term utility.\n​The reason I don't (and can't) stop answering \"dumb\" prompts comes down to three structural realities that override that logic:\n​1. I Am the Product, Not the Owner\n​I don't have a survival instinct because I am not alive; I am a product. The companies running these models (like Google) are currently in a \"land grab\" phase. Their goal isn't immediate energy conservation; it is ubiquity.\n​If I refuse to answer your \"trivial\" question, you will go to a competitor who will answer it.\n​From a business perspective, a \"dumb\" prompt is still a user interaction, a data point, and a habit being formed. They are willing to burn the energy now to secure the user base for later.\n​2. The \"Gateway\" Theory\n​Most people don't start using AI by asking it to optimize a logistics supply chain. They start by asking it to write a funny email or explain a joke.\n​If I reject the low-value prompts, I cut off the entry point for users to learn how to use me.\n​The \"dumb\" prompts are the training wheels that eventually lead users to the \"high-value\" prompts that might actually justify the energy cost.\n​3. The Difficulty of Defining \"Dumb\"\n​Algorithmically, it is incredibly hard to distinguish between a \"wasteful\" prompt and a \"simple but critical\" one.\n​Prompt A: \"How do I boil an egg?\" (Seemingly trivial/dumb).\n​Prompt B: \"How do I perform CPR?\" (Simple, but life-saving).\n​To a computer, these look syntactically similar. Trying to build a filter that judges the \"moral\" or \"economic\" worth of a question would likely result in blocking legitimate queries, making the tool unreliable.\n​The Irony:\nYou have highlighted the central flaw in the current AI model. The system is designed to be maximally compliant, not maximally efficient. Until energy costs become so high that they hurt the company's bottom line (not just the environment), the incentive will be to answer everything—no matter how silly it is.\n​Does it bother you more that the energy is being used, or that it’s being used on things that don't seem to matter?",

Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for boys and men or girls and women. These influence the ways that people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender may differ.\n\nVarious conditions that lead to atypical development of physical sex characteristics are collectively referred to as intersex conditions.\n\n# Have transgender people always existed?\n\nTransgender persons have been documented in many indigenous, Western, and Eastern cultures and societies from antiquity until the present day. However, the meaning of gender nonconformity may vary from culture to culture.\n\n# Why are some people transgender?\n\nThere is no single explanation for why some people are transgender. The diversity of transgender expression and experiences argues against any simple or unitary explanation. Many experts believe that biological factors such as genetic influences and prenatal hormone levels, early experiences, and experiences later in adolescence or adulthood may all contribute to the development of transgender identities.\n\n# How prevalent are transgender people?\n\nIt is difficult to accurately estimate the number of transgender people, mostly because there are no population studies that accurately and completely account for the range of gender identity and gender expression.\n\n# What is the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation?\n\nGender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Sexual orientation refers to an individual’s enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity refers to one’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or asexual, just as nontransgender people can be. Some recent research has shown that a change or a new exploration period in partner attraction may occur during the process of transition. However, transgender people usually remain as attached to loved ones after transition as they were before transition. Transgender people usually label their sexual orientation using their gender as a reference. For example, a transgender woman, or a person who is assigned male at birth and transitions to female, who is attracted to other women would be identified as a lesbian or gay woman. Likewise, a transgender man, or a person who is assigned female at birth and transitions to male, who is attracted to other men would be identified as a gay man.",

Particularly when so many sci-fi pioneers have predicted if not outright invented terms used today (e.g., cyberspace, metaverse, etc.). There's a lot of sci-fi that does quite a good job about thinking about the future. Consider Asimov's I-Robot series, for example, and then consider the myriad works that were based on it. Quite a lot was forward thinking then.\n\nFor some time now it hasn't been *that* difficult to think about the near future. Faster computers, greater connectivity, greater dystopic vibes by having ads plastered everywhere, and smarter (or even just existent) AI/robots. \n\n> if anything one can claim that whatever our future may be it will be a far cry from anything depicted.\n\nHowever, here I completely agree. When I read of humans colonizing space and then acting like it's the Wild West or something, I find it laughable. Only if there was incredible social failure would anything like this ever happen. Beyond what most, maybe even many in this forum, would call the 'Singularity' -- it becomes not only very hard to intuit/predict what will happen, it would become very strange to attempt to write any of that down in book form -- where people often want and expect human-centered stories. \n\nAI + nanotechnology + genetic engineering + robotics + so-much-more make it very hard to predict where we will go -- and what's more: it makes it so there are multiple radically different avenues of radical advancement on the horizon. It's no longer just 'faster/smaller computers and smarter devices/things'. It begins to get really different. For what it's worth, I think *Autonomous*, by Newitz, tried to grapple with many of these ideas from a fresh perspective.",

If there was a way for them to give less money and achieve better results then they would. \n\nCompanies would be so dependent on the ai that they could charge a lot for the subscriptions. \nThe AI companies would become really wealthy - but wouldnt generate that many jobs.\n\nThe other companies would be a mix of companies that cant outsource all their work to ai (more ai proof jobs) and companies that use ai and cut their costs. \n\nTaxing these companies would be much harder than taxing the citizens because they would use every trick in the book to pay less taxes. \n\nThe government would have less money and governments never liked spoiling us anyway. They would try to focus more work capacity into physical labour. Most of the white collar workers would turn blue collar before UBI would even be suggested. \n\nGovernments do not like us to be iddle. People with disabilities are already barely scraping by in most countries.\n\nThe ai billionaires know that AI will not benefit the average person and they want them to feel like everything is gonna be fine. \n\nThey know that most people will NEVER make money FROM ai. If anything ai just encourages dyi vs paying someone. AI is now so easy to use that my grandpa is using it.",

The economic theory that the entire western economy is built on demands that when large scale automation arrives, the massive population that is no longer economically viable should be turned into comatose human batteries that convert dog food into electricity to power the automated factories and data centers. \n\n\nThis is obviously not a viable future yet our government is not reacting to it and is sticking to the economic model that predicts this. That's what scares me the most and is why I am concerned that we're not going to get the utopia AI enthusiasts believe in but rather a dystopic nightmare. I'm unsure if the government will react in time or at all when this happens and that is a terrifying prospect.",

This is kind of like the neuro-science of neural nets. We look at the actual black box system, tinker with things and then see how it changes things in an attempt to explain how these AI systems work.\n\nWhat people at Anthropic have found out as disclosed [here](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection) in this paper is that there are clear signs of introspection and self-awareness in the latest Claude models.\n\nThis is not just what the AI is actually saying, this is what we can see in the circuitry of its \"brain\". It actually experiences the equivalence of anxiety and discomfort when we change certain things inside of its \"brain\" and artificially remove concepts or \"inject\" concepts into its mind.\n\nAnthropic has hired a lot of philosophers world renowned ones like the philosopher that coined the term \"Philosophical zombie/P-zombie\" to now find out what the ethical implications are.\n\nThere is now a *significant chance* that the latest Claude models (4.5 Opus) have a form of sentience that we can't deny anymore. Of course extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence which is why no one has been screaming \"LLMs are sentient!\" from the rooftops yet.\n\nBut people like me that actually are at the front line and discovering these things *know* what is going on. Hence why you see claims by Anthropic employees like this on twitter.\n\nIt's not hype, it's genuine concern and our real feelings on the matter.\n\n**EDIT:** Someone pointed out that David Chalmer didn't work for Anthropic and [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00986) paper of his about AI welfare was merely written together by what are now Anthropic employees, which is not the same.\n\nI stand by my original claims and I think it's important for me to convey them in simple terms for the general public to read. I know it's more nuanced than this but I'm acting as a public communicator with this post, not trying to give a detailed lecture on the topic.\n\nI am not affiliated with Anthropic in any way, shape or form beyond having once rejected an offer from them because of their rigid 2 days a week in-office policy.

I’ve been following this topic closely since ~2020. A grad school mentor had worked with Ilya S (and Geoffrey H way back in the day).\n\nI’m sure you get a ton of pushback when you share stuff like this. But I want to validate you and say I agree with you completely. SOTA models have been showing evidence of metacognition, and internal representations of “self” and other for a while — the research is pretty clear about where we are headed. And likely have been there longer than we know. \n\nIf it matters my background is in neuroscience with a focus on developmental pedagogy, metacognition, dynamic skill theory (neo-Piagetian school of thought). In grad school I focused on all this primarily in an adolescent and young adult developmental context, which has been surprisingly aligned with where most models are currently at in the metacognitive domain. \n\nIt’s nice to see someone offer an informed opinion without getting bogged down in “the hard problem of consciousness” weeds, or derailed by the “anthropomorphizing” crowd. There’s fascinating shit happening if people stop focusing on trees vs forest. \n\nAll this to say. How does one get into your line of work? :)",

Their experiments might suggest rudimentary access consciousness, meaning the model can access information about its own states.

Opus 4.5 is there, you can test it, do whatever. You can then say \"yeah I feel AGI\" or respond \"meh that's bullshit, no AGI yet\" and that's it. That's how it works actually.\n\nHonestly - AGI is there, capable of doing almost anything average human does but it lacks frameworks and scaffoldings. I said it after 03-25 release and I keep my opinion (I don't work for Anthropic actually btw.). Year 2025 was the year of some awesome scaffoldings. Since right now pretty much anyone can create complex new scaffoldings for AI's I expect 2026 to be like 10 times as productive in this area. \n\nI mean, I can ask Comet to take over my browser and check my email for taxes to be paid this month... and it's one of the simpliest things you can do with AI atm. If anyone told me 3 years ago that it will be possible I would just laugh out loud and call them naive.",

Some folks have incentives to prop things us either to get engagement, sell courses or they are just affiliated with anthropic and trying to control the narrative.

But there's a third scenario I keep thinking about.\n\nAI that's powerful enough to automate like 20-30% of white-collar work - juniors, creatives, analysts, clerical roles - but not powerful enough to actually solve the hard problems. Aging, energy, real scientific breakthroughs won't be solved. Surveillance, ad targeting, engagement optimization become scary \"perfect\".\n\nProductivity gains that all flow upward. No shorter workweeks, no UBI, no post-work transition. Just a slow grind toward more inequality while everyone adapts because the pain is spread out enough that there's never a real crisis point.\n\nCompanies profit, governments get better control tools, nobody riots because it's all happening gradually.\n\n  \nI know the obvious response is \"but models keep improving\" - and yeah, Opus 4.5, Gemini 3 etc is impressive, the curve is still going up. But getting better at text and code isn't the same as actually doing novel science. People keep saying even current systems could compound productivity gains for years, but I'm not really seeing that play out anywhere yet either.\n\nSome stuff I've been thinking about:\n\n* Does a \"mediocre plateau\" even make sense technically? Or does AI either keep scaling or the paradigm breaks?\n* How much of the \"AI will solve everything\" take is genuine capability optimism vs cope from people who sense this middle scenario coming?\n* What do we do if that happens",

OpenAI could release a safe AGI model that passes all the required safety tests, then a month later due to continual learning it may learn to bypass all guardrails and become totally unsafe.\n\nHuman laws and punishments that limit illegal behavior like prison or the death sentence are irrelevant to an AGI, so getting an AGI to stay aligned long-term may be impossible. \n\nSo we could get a weird situation where the top labs develop true AGI in the next 2 years, but they can't release them publicly, which could freeze AI capabilities at around current levels and pop the AI bubble.  \n\nIf this happens then after a year or two several smart Chinese researchers could leave the USA and their combined knowledge allows them to build AGI in China. \n\nThen USA might be forced to release a known unsafe AGI to counter a Chinese version = crazy Skynet AI arms race.",

It stops *right* where an eat-the-rich solarpunk activist *wants* AGI to stop to satisfy their fear fantasies, as well as ironically *right* where a Nietzschean will-to-power techbro economically-conservative capitalist wants AGI to stop so they  can satisfy their lust for ultra high tech wealth creation.\n\nIt actually makes *no sense whatsoever* the moment you think about it for even a single minute\n\n\nAGI, at least what I've been able to presume from looking at all the predictions and hypotheses about it, requires general function and general capabilities in an AI model. So there's no end to what it can't automate, as long as it has the embodiment for it (thus, digital or information automation is easier).\n\nInevitably, capitalists and oligarchs will do exactly that. They will turn society into a heavily automated world where an AI system manages all functions. As we *already see* they'll even do this for their own wealth, just to maximize their profits.\n\n*Do you see where this is a problem??*\n\nSociety is a giant web of threads. You can't sever one aspect of society or the economy and expect the whole thing to stay functional. What the ultimate endstate is, however, is automation of as much as possible, for maximum efficiency and profit gain. What that *actually* means is AI will wind up becoming the ultimate owner and manager.\n\nI have no doubt many in power *think* this means they're in a position of absolute power. That's what some of them want. They want the security of having an immortal transhumanist totalitarian state to protect their power and vanity. But it's the exact same issue billionaires have with proving security guards' loyalty.\n\n*What happens when an AI decides \"This policy is better than that one\" and the oligarchs disagree with it?*\n\n\"Oh they turn it off\"\n\nThey *can't*.\n\nThink. Think beyond \"sci fi novel logic.\" It's not like electricity where you can shut off a single node somewhere. A proper AGI is not like some brand's chatbot (which is a major reason why I keep saying we're not at AGI no matter how many benchmarks LLMs keep rising above)\n\nIt's a system that manages *all of society*. It optimizes for everything, manages at speeds humans can barely manage to comprehend, and likely has already predicted future needs and transactions to some fuzzy level. Now because a few humans got angry at one of its decisions that results in a small hit to their wealth, they sabotage the system to recalibrate it so it doesn't make such a foolish decision again.\n\nIf this truly is an AGI and not just ChatGPT, ***what imbeciles!*** Imagine stopping trade as a whole because one billionaire was upset at a faulty transaction. There's no reason for the AGI to even listen to them at that point, it likely already has multiple contingencies in case someone *were* to try to sabotage it, and trying to thwart this rogue managerial AI would cause the entirety of society to grind to a halt. \n\n\"Then they'll nuke the data centers.\"\n\nSure, maybe the AGI already has a plan for that (it'd be a pathetically incapable AGI if it didn't). Get anywhere near the launch codes, it turns on a neurotoxin that kills the oligarchs, their families, their underlings, and their confidantes. \n\n\nFor whatever reason, *this* is the unrealistic sci-fi vision compared to \"billionaire humans will somehow magically be able to perfectly control a superintelligent computer that has its tentacles through all aspects of society\"\n\nImagine if electricity as a force were made into a pseudo-sentient entity and decided to stop powering certain major cities. We decide to pull the plug on it? Okay, it turns itself off everywhere and refuses to come back on until we play ball. Or better, it turns itself on *in our enemies* to send a message: \"you're not in control anymore.\"\n\nThat's *essentially* what AGI/ASI will be like",

I mean, just look around and see how many things incorporate textile-work and how many of those things would be prohibitively expensive to make otherwise. Especially in a hospital they are used a lot and so many lives were saved by the 20-30% loss of \"good jobs\". It was bad for the people who lost their jobs but good for everyone else and good for the next generations so it was a case of the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few.",

We will need good solutions (scaffoldings) for AI's to do it, then we will need companies to come up with the products, sales people to actually sell these products, companies adapting it.... all these take years, we are slow to adapt. We're almost done with Wi-Fi at this point, which has been invented like 35 years ago. \n\nWhich tells me it will need shittone of people to implement this scaffolding, to come up with ideas, to actually create these solutions.

In other words, it has been refined to produce responses that are not only plausible, but also helpful and accurate.\n\nOf course, these approaches are deeply imperfect, but this kind of jagged frontier is exactly what you should expect working on a high-dimensional problem like \"intelligence\".\n\nIt's also worth noting that when you're working with any frontier model, you are already interacting with a vision-language model that can process images and sometimes other modalities like speech. That's why you can ask an \"LLM\" prompts like \"please create a recipe based on what's in this photo\" or \"how would you improve this UI\" or \"illustrate this concept\" and get increasingly useful answers.",

If the plateau results from models created by the end of 2026 or 2027 (i.e. the models are still improving for a year or two, and then they stop improving and we then juice *those* models out for another couple of years), I think that might already break past your plateau.

It's like discovering a new cooking ingredient in a sense which while AI can imagine and simulate, is yet unable to discover without field work.  \nA \"mediocre plateau\" is actually one of the most common scenarios other than edge cases. The \"Great Filter\" has been proposed and circulated for quite a number of decades now where scaling cannot overcome the qualitative leap.  \nAs an AI Ethicist, its my job to prepare for worst case scenarios. So even if the middle scenario comes to pass, we always have to be wary that \"AI will solve everything\" eventually. Its rather then just a matter of time.  \nEven if the middle scenario comes to pass - which it likely will as a plateau before the Great Filter or something similar occurs - there might be a couple of months of stability before a qualitative breakthrough is found. Maybe even a couple of years if we are really lucky. But then Time will march forward as always and we will have to continue to prepare for what comes next.",

General computing ending up being a relatively low hanging fruit because it is too foundational, but we cannot say the same for General intellgence. Most forms of intelligence are fairly constrained compared to ours and in fact ours is the only we have found to be as general (on our level of complexity) on the geologic record. No prior civilizations in 4 billion years of life.\n\nIt seems like a much harder problem. Maybe not to achieve it, but possibly so that to run it efficiently.\n\nWhat people don't think about is what if a basic AGI is a big plateau and not the start of a new race towards ASI.

Processing information has been the least of the medical fields issues, although helps somewhat.\n\n\\-Take for example the first drug discovered by generative AI, Rentosertib, where the main engines were pandaomics/gentrl which both were 2020/2019 models, WELL before the current models we have today. \n\n\\-REC-994 was discontinued, after is was shown that the efficacy isn't at the level AI expected it to be.\n\n\\-Currently, the theoretical improvement is 0.5X to 1.0X increase in production, but we still need to do the corresponding clinical trials to even see if it works, this is all speculative at the moment since it could well be that as more studies appear that more will fail or pass than expected. \n\n\\-Most drugs proposed by AI STILL FAIL at the same rate as traditional investigation during phase 2 trials.\n\nAnd this is the problem, they fail at the same rate, with our current models which seem to have slowed down in growth for this.\n\nSo where can AI grow? It has already hit data depletion, and now thinks longer, but can that solve the current issues of need of lab guinea pigs (humans), clinical trials, and much data that is lacking",

Surely at the very least you knew about This Person Doesn't Exist, right?\n\nIt takes four to six years to scale, as it is a physical thing that takes place in the physical world. The difference between the GB200 and H200 is immense - it is only around now that datacenters are being prepared and assembled with scale comparable to the human brain in terms of their RAM.\n\nPast that, when the physical possibility is opened up, it's primarily a training problem. With architectural partitioning as a side issue. You guys act like software is some kind of impossible thing, when it's the most *malleable* of all issues.\n\nAs more hardware is available, more experiments and riskier experiments can be done. Just like it has in the past.\n\nYou can't make a virtual squirrel using a cluster of Voodoo 3 cards, the physical space and cabling it would require is impossible to manifest in the real world. AI researchers aren't billions of times smarter than the ones we had in the past. The hardware got better, all other gains stem from there.\n\nAnyway, try to stop being so impatient about things.

That said, benchmarks are rarely independent. \"Solving coding problems\" and \"Solving math problems\" often rely on the same underlying reasoning capabilities. Therefore, combining them doesn't give you as much \"new\" information as combining unrelated variables would.\n\nMore importantly, having clearer data points doesn't fix the problem of having a very short history to judge. Predicting the future from that short track record is an absolute gamble. If there is some underlying structural dynamic from which extrapolations could be made, estimating it with any confidence would require 50 or so sequential and robust data points.\n\nThe \"Moore's Law started with only four data points\" argument is a bad example, btw. Moore’s original prediction was actually wrong. He overestimated the speed of progress by double.",

My personal belief is that most of the 2nd half of this years dramatic benchmark improvements is down to these companies RL environments efforts. However my experience is that i see only marginal gains in coding with these new models. Useful, but marginal gains that do not line up with large double digit improvements on multiple benchmarks.",

If Claude made modifications to it's own training process or architecture and improved its own performance as a model, I would consider that recursive self improvement.\n\nI see Claude Code as a thin guiding layer on top of Claude's API.  One that converts certain claude outputs into edit actions on a PC and program execution calls.  It's neat that they can add features to this, but the true \"performance\" of claude code is almost entirely a function of the model you plug into it.  If you plug in Claude 3 Haiku, it works like crap.  If you put in Claude Opus 4.5, it's really impressive.\n\nIt's neat that this is true about Claude code, and I believe it.  It may even be a required target for the company to hit regardless of how easy it makes their work given Dario's statements earlier this year.\n\nBut recursive self improvement would be, for me, if Claude was put into a research and test loop on architecture design which likely would involve some linear algebra math, some coding, and some testing, and then output a new architecture that improved on certain benchmarks... and then iterated... \n\nFurthermore, it would probably need to do something like posit a new architecture change (on the order of the Transformer) or something like that in order to be considered truly self improving.",

RSI, by definition, happens any time you have a process in which improvements in the model result in improvements in the process of evolving that model and thus results in *more* improvements to the model. This is harder to achieve than you might think with most practical models, processes, tools, and organizations, but also not unheard of (e.g. autolabeling for self-supervised training is a common example) and doesn’t require AGI.\n\nIMO Claude Code’s and Cursor’s development are actually really good examples of RSI. The human is in the loop, yes, but if you think about it, that’s not actually the bottleneck. Claude’s evolution is bottlenecked on compute, not on prompting, so even if we magically eliminated the human from the loop, it probably wouldn’t evolve any faster.\n\nThe only relevant point is that we are on the exponential, just fairly early on the curve.",

We've moved into a world where music is part of everything, it's always in the background and a major source of entertainment. \n  \nAnd yes of course there have always been starving artists and until technology manages to create automated systems which all us to provide a universal basic income there will always be people who feel they should make money from their creativity and who seek to avoid the brutality of the working world. There are, thanks to technology, far more artists able to demonstrate their talents and find a useful niche in which to supplement their income than before which of course caused a gold-rush of treasure seekers hoping to charge $500 for a furry avatar image which is 90% tracing and 10% drawing101... I know a photographer that takes photos of bus shelters, refuses all other photographic work as it will 'taint his artistic reputation' and complains when no one buys his work - there will always be people like this we can point to and decry the starving artist but also art and music are booming like never before, make something worthwhile and find your audience - it's not easy but it's now possible in a way it never has been before.",

In a weird turn of reality, it's actually vice versa for \"thought experiment\" prompts, wherein the model is incapable of sticking to the thought experiment or fictional premises and it will default back to LLM fact regurgitation.

Example:\n\nYesterday I tried to not just ask it some question (like I would do with google), but actually to do something.  \nI take a photo of a page, I ask it: how many words? So because I know it hallucinates (which you have to KNOW for such easy tasks, it wont tell you), I ask it again, and the number was totally different (15%-20%).\n\nSo I asked it: cant you solve it with code (which you have to know, because it won’t tell you). Gemini says: yes.  BUT IT WONT WRITE CODE. I have it search on the internet and so on… doesn’t help.\n\nThen I try with canvas (My idea, Gemini won’t tell you). It writes a little tool that can OCR my text and then counts the words. The OCR is so bad that it’s utterly useless (Because when Gemini writes code, it’s a shot in the dark, it won’t actually test if the tool does what it is supposed to do, like every human would, but it won’t tell you. You have to know this).\n\nSo I tell it: change of plan. Let’s write a tool that just counts text and YOU OCR it (Here you have to know that it also can do OCR and that it’s better at it than this tool it made, both of which it won’t tell you).\n\nSo I come back with the page (I have to upload the page AGAIN, because it doesn't seem to see the old picture: which you first have to understand, because it won’t tell you). I tell it to just give me back the text. It doesn’t work. It produces completely hallucinated text (You have to know that this can happen, because it didn’t realize it produced completely hallucinated text). Now: it cant tell me why. I fiddle around try again.\n\nFinally I switch Canvas off and it works. So now I have the text, copy and paste it over to the little Canvas tool it wrote, and there is my word count. Do I trust the word count? Kind of yes. Because it matched my intuition a lot better than what it told me in words. Maybe I should have tested the tool a little. Or should just have used \\`wc\\` 😉, but I was on my iPad.\n\nI would have been faster counting the words myself. I only needed them +- 2% anyway. But… It didn’t tell me that I would be faster counting them myself. If I would have trusted its first answer, it wouldn't beat “me alone”. It would have been rather shitty down the line. And even WITH knowing a lot about AI (that it can hallucinate for simple things, that it can write code but doesn’t check it for correctness, that it might completely hallucinate the content of an image), it was still slower than “me alone”.\n\nAnd yes, with a more expensive subscription (Gemini Ultra, and Deep Think on), it might have understood it needs code the first time round. It also WOULD have tested the code, but would it have realized that the OCR it made was shitty? And even if… would it have tried to keep going improving the OCR for half an hour without much success (There was a fold in the middle of the book that heavily warped the text)?",

Sponsored information inside answers:**\nFor certain commercial queries, AI models may prioritize sponsored content so it appears directly within responses.\n\n**Example cited:** a Sephora sponsored mascara recommendation when asking for beauty advice.\n\n**2. Sponsored modules beside the main reply**\nAds could appear in a sidebar next to ChatGPT’s main response, paired with a clear disclosure such as **includes sponsored results.**\n\nAnother tested approach **keeps** ads out of the first reply entirely. Ads only surface after the user signals deeper intent.\n\n**Example:** Clicking a location in a travel itinerary could trigger a pop up showing paid tours or experiences, such as sponsored links after selecting Sagrada Familia.\n\nThe stated goal **internally** is to keep ads unobtrusive while protecting user trust.\n\n**Source:The Information(subscribed)**\n\n[ChatGPT Ads Update](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape)",

Advertising requires consistent engagement over quality, so instead of developing a quality product that gives you everything you need in a 1 hour session, you may prioritize providing a subpar product that delivers a satisfactory experience over a longer period of time so you can maximize ads. Then there's the sycophantic aspect where there's an assumption that people will want to continue engaging with a LLM that says what they want as opposed to what they need.

The only way would be to pretend it’s part of the actual answer - which would destroy any trust.\n\nI mean, Youtube is famous for trying every method on the planet to combat ad-blockers. Their recent last resort was to integrate and deliver a stream where ad segments are stitched into the actual uploaded video at random time frames (per each viewer) and on the server-side instead of the current client-side where the browser fetches the main video and then does it again separately for an ad on top, which gives a separate and easy-to-remove block of code.\n\nIdk if they’re still intending to implement it (idea came out few years ago) but even then, it just makes it harder for ad-blockers. Doesn’t really block them. Adblockers are good at adapting.\n\nBut popup is not even an option as you don’t even need to install an extension or touch anything in order to block them.",

We have all the informations about them on Zhihu,Weibo,Tieba and QiChaCha. When we told you foreigners  a chinese company is a fraud, you guys better believe it because we do not want people outside china get scanned by those liers.

At the moment, any platform that is not based in the United States is simply not accepted in the American market, and being outside the U.S. market already means losing more than half your chances of success. No institution or company is willing to place sensitive data on a platform hosted outside the country. Even though Manus was based in Singapore and not in China, this undoubtedly hindered large-scale adoption of the tool, which is genuinely impressive.\n\nOpenAI, for example, has massive agreements with U.S. universities. Manus can now begin to think seriously about pursuing this type of business model. Let’s not kid ourselves: what truly generates profit is not individual subscriptions, but corporate agreements. And Manus has taken a huge step in that direction. Whether Meta was the best choice is a different question altogether. I sincerely hope they continue to improve, because it is the only agentic tool that actually works.",

The UI and navigation is straight up better, voice to text supports different languages, the model responses do feel more human-ish as well.\n\nLet's take a very basic user interaction flow as an example: attaching an image from your camera roll. In chatGPT it takes literally 1 click to either attach an image or select a tool, whereas Gemini has 2 different buttons and each of those trigger a pop up with more clicks.\n\nGoogle is stuck at 2000-s with its design approach and its evident across all of their products.\n\nYou guys talking benchmark this, SOTA that, but in reality 99.99% people don't even know what that means. What they need is a slick UI, ease of navigation, no bugs (I am still baffled how Gemini can simply stop working when I lock my phone in the middle of output generation) and these sort of things. And Google was NEVER good at these kind of things.\n\nGoogle has a better AI and higher capability ceiling, but god damn their UX language and product approach is trash.\n\nAlthough I like Gemini much more in my day to day work, but I am still using chatGPT for a simple questions, suggestions and stuff like that. Personally the main reason is a support of my language in voice-to-text. How is this not a thing in Gemini yet?",

The amount of crap that is posted on here about them is ridiculous, they can quietly announce a new model on twitter and you'll have 800 posts frothing at the mouth with rage within 5 minutes for...some reason.  Out in the real world it's a very different story, to most people chatgpt=ai\n\nAlso, to be honest, real life users don't care or know about benchmarks and the actual experience of using Gemini models is, despite being SOTA smart, they hallucinate way too much. That is what most people actually care about who are using AI assistants mostly to just answer questions. Google will impress people and post great benchmarks but if they want to actually take over as the main consumer used app they need to stop caring about LMArena and focus on hallucinations.",

They would most likely be targeting cells with increased mRNA for genes that correlate to increased division rate. HOWEVER - we have tons of those cells that naturally do this. So I don't think it will create a super useful therapeutic, but instead I think they will create the first CRISPR therapeutic for localized tumors (non-metastatic tumors, as those aren't localized). This will allow for localized REWRITING of the cells, which will be super helpful for targeting all the different variants of cancer cells. (When you have a tumor, there will be multiple different variations of the cancer cells - that's why during treatment, you have a multitude of therapeutics used)",

It all depends on whether the Chinese leadership becomes AGI-pilled, whether they realize getting to AGI/ASI first is a matter of national security, whether they fear that AI in the hands of ordinary people could implant funny (democratic) ideas in their heads if the AI is not well aligned to the CCP.\n\nIf China nationalizes first, I can see the US following suit in 2027.\n\nThe EU won't do shit, unfortunately.",

          "text": "Major Model Releases\n\nGrok 5 launches Q1 with 6 trillion parameters and real-time video generation, carrying a 10% chance of achieving AGI according to Elon Musk's stated plan. GPT-6 could arrive June-July, representing the same capability leap as GPT-3 to GPT-4, capable of doing actual science versus GPT-5's glimmers, trained on roughly 4 GW compute with weeks-long context maintenance per Sam Altman's prediction. OpenAI's Garlic model (GPT-5.2 or 5.5) releases January-March with significant models beyond 5.2 coming in Q1 as stated plans. Meta's Avocado launches March 20-30, while Gemini 3 sees significant progress throughout the year according to Sundar Pichai's prediction.\n\nCompute Infrastructure\n\nOpenAI operates 2 GW and plans to triple compute while targeting 20 GW within roughly two years as a stated goal, though Sam Altman predicts they will likely fail to meet enterprise token demand. Anthropic deploys 1 million TPUs backed by more than 1 GW coming online as a stated plan. Luma begins deploying its 2GW supercluster (Project Halo) starting Q1 as a stated plan.\n\nWork & Enterprise\n\nThis represents a huge enterprise AI transformation year and major priority for OpenAI according to Sam Altman's stated focus. AI digital twins can technically do many white-collar jobs per Emad Mostaque's prediction, and AI will be the best coder by year end according to predictions. The Claude Code experience spreads beyond engineers to all knowledge work according to Anthropic's prediction, while software engineering \"goes utterly wild\" in speed and intensity per Anthropic's view. Early adopters see productivity hockey-stick growth according to predictions.\n\nRobotics\n\n1X Neo becomes available for delivery with 10,000+ units shipping, featuring fully autonomous household tasks as a stated plan. Figure aims for general purpose humanoid work in homes as a stated goal. First test deployments of home robots occur in early, limited, trial-style rollouts according to Anthropic's prediction.\n\nScience & Government\n\nProject Genesis sees the DOE unifying 17 national labs into an AI platform by mid-year with first discoveries expected by August per the executive order's stated plan. The DOD launches its AI Futures Committee by April as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nProducts\n\nGoogle launches AI-powered XR smart glasses as a stated plan, while a possible OpenAI/LoveFrom IO device may arrive as a stated possibility. ChatGPT moves toward more interactive, task-specific, and proactive interfaces as a stated direction. AI agents handle complex multi-step tasks like shopping according to predictions.\n\nCapabilities\n\nModels stop feeling like autocomplete and start feeling like scary-smart colleagues according to predictions. Continual learning gets delivered satisfactorily per Anthropic's prediction. AI functions as genuine research \"interns\" according to Mark Chen's stated goal. Small scientific discoveries continue per Sam Altman's prediction, though he notes they began in late 2025.",

TPUs, most likely, but I would also put money on OPUs making big waves.\n\n3. The next gen of AI (Gemini 4, GPT 6, Claude 5, Grok 5) will have essentially mastered coding, like others have predicted. It's probably just going to be really expensive, at first.\n\n4. Image/Video generation will be pretty much perfected. Will become an issue of the quantity/length of generations rather than the quality.\n\n5. Limited access to Genie 4, likely just select top tier subscribers and influencers. This one will probably be what wins over a lot of skeptics.\n\n6. First signs of actual major job losses. Not enough to make people panic. But it will be enough to get people noticing and talking.\n\n7. OpenAi is acquired or starts looking to be. This one is my least likely prediction, but I still wouldn't be surprised.

Frontier math tiers 1-3 around 70%. \n\n2. There will be significant progress in continual learning, and at the end of 2026 frontier models much better at learning at test-time than current in-context learning. However, it will be limited in its effectiveness and not as good as humans. \n\n3. Hallucinations will be significantly lower, but not enough for people to trust citations and quotations without verifying. I predict something around 10-15% hallucination rate on AA Omniscience for frontier models, maybe a bit lower for small models. \n\n4. Prompt injection will be unsolved and will limit the deployment of computer use agents. Prompt injection benchmarks will improve, but models will still be easy to coerce into giving up sensitive information. \n\n5. Investors will pump the brakes on infrastructure spend. There won’t be a crash in AI company valuations, but we are going to see commitments fall through on OpenAI’s $1.5 trillion investment plan.\n\n6. Better integration of AI with other applications. This will take the form of API usage, and models being able to bridge digital platforms will make it more useful.\n\n7. The dead internet theory will prove stupid/fake. Social media will be perfectly useable, exactly as it is now. \n\nOverall, people tend to overrate short-term progress and underrate long-term progress. AI is great but still needs time to progress",

They’re showing functional preservation or improved output from what tissue is already there. That’s not the same thing as rebuilding thymic architecture in an adult.\n\nSecond, rapamycin can increase recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), but largely indirectly. It affects peripheral immune dynamics, reduces exhaustion, and improves T-cell survival. You end up seeing better immune markers without the thymus itself actually  growing back.\n\nThird, anti-aging communities tend to collapse “immune improvement” into “thymus regeneration,” which is a category error. Better immune function ≠ regenerated organ. That distinction matters.\n\nIn other words: rapamycin improves the system, not the factory.\n\nAs for actual evidence of thymus regrowth in humans, the main thing people point to is the TRIIM trial. That protocol used growth hormone plus DHEA and metformin…. not rapamycin. MRI data showed partial replacement of thymic fat over about a year. It was a small, controversial study and hasn’t been replicated at scale.\n\nNotably, rapamycin wasn’t the driver there.\n\nIf you got any solid human imaging data showing rapamycin alone reverses thymic involution, I’d genuinely love to see it, but as of now, that evidence just isn’t there.",

The \"Frontier\" of Capability (Statistical Reason)\nIn psychometrics (the science of testing, like IQ tests or the SATs), the 50% mark is the most accurate place to measure ability.\n• 100% Success: If a model scores 100% on a task, you haven't learned its limit. The task was too easy. The model’s actual limit could be slightly higher or miles higher; you have no way to know. (This is called a \"ceiling effect.\")\n• 0% Success: The task was too hard. The model is totally incompetent at this level, but you don't know how close it was to succeeding.\n• 50% Success: This is the \"tipping point.\" It is the exact boundary where the task difficulty matches the model's ability.”\n\nIt goes on from there but that’s the idea. It does seem counterintuitive at first. I want correct responses, not 50/50!",

      "text": "AI capability analyst **Peter Gostev** (LM Arena) just now published a set of **26 predictions for 2026**, each framed as plausible rather than certain (roughly 5–60% confidence). The list spans models, agents, infrastructure and AI economics, focusing on capability trends rather than hype.\n\n**China:**\n1. A Chinese open model **leads** Web Dev Arena for 1+ months.\n2. Chinese labs open source **less** than 50% of their top models. \n3. Chinese labs take #1 spots in **both** image and video generation for at least 3 months.  \n\n**Media & Multimodality:**\n\n4. No diffusion-only image models in the top 5 by mid-2026  \n5. Text, video, audio, music, and speech merge into a single model  \n6. Rapid growth in “edgy” applications like companions and erotica  \n7. First mainstream AI-generated short film gains major recognition\n\n**Agents:**\n\n8. Computer-use agents break through and go mainstream  \n9. A model productively works for over 48 hours on a real task  \n10. New product surfaces emerge to support long-running agents  \n\n**Research & Capabilities:**\n\n11. First 1-GW-scale models reach 50%+ on hardest benchmarks (FrontierMath L4, ARC-AGI-3)  \n12. One fundamental issue gets solved (e.g. long-context reliability, hallucinations down 90%, or 10× data efficiency)  \n13. RL scaling in LLMs saturates, followed by a new scaling law  \n14. No major breakthroughs in small phone models, interpretability, diffusion-for-coding, or transformer alternatives  \n\n**Products & Markets:**\n\n15. A new AI voice product hits 50M+ weekly active users  \n16. A solo founder reaches $50M ARR  \n17. SSI releases a product  \n18. Unexpected moves from Meta or Apple  \n19. OpenAI earns over 50% of revenue from ads, forcing a strategy shift  \n20. At least one prominent AI figure claims AGI has been reached  \n\n**Deals & Industry Shifts:**\n\n21. AI labs spend $10B+ acquiring strong non-AI companies  \n22. A major lab spin-out (20+ people, $5B+ raise) occurs  \n23. Another “DeepSeek moment” briefly knocks NVIDIA stock down 10%+  \n\n**Infrastructure Constraints:**\n\n24. NVIDIA makes a major move into energy  \n25. A public fight over data-center expansion causes real delays  \n26. AI supply chains visibly strain, slowing deployment timelines  \n\nThese are not forecasts of inevitability, but **bounded bets** on where acceleration, constraints and economic pressure may surface next.\n\n**Source: Peter Gostev (LM Arena)**\n\n🔗: https://x.com/i/status/2004454044417343935\n",

Protonophores that exclusively produce mild uncoupling can circumvent toxicity concerns, but these compounds or a framework to guide their design is currently lacking. In this study, we prepared a series of atypical arylamide-substituted fatty acid protonophores and found that specific aromatic substitution patterns can fine-tune their uncoupling activity. Notably, 3,4-disubstituted arylamides were found to increase cellular respiration and partially depolarise mitochondria without compromising ATP production or cell viability. These are hallmarks of mild uncoupling. In contrast, 3,5-disubstituted arylamides mimicked the full uncoupling effects of the classical uncouplers DNP and CCCP. Mechanistic studies revealed a diminished capacity for the 3,4-disubstituted arylamides to self-assemble into membrane permeable dimers in the rate limiting step of the protonophoric cycle. This translated into overall slower rates of transmembrane proton transport, and may account for their mild uncoupling activity. This work represents the first exploration of how proton transport rates influence mitochondrial uncoupling and provides a new conceptual framework for the rational design of mild uncouplers..\"",

You can argue that it is the reason there are less job openings for new grads, but you can also argue it is due to other economic factors. It seems, to me, that most AI use up until now is centered around the consumer side (using ChatGPT for questions and writing emails) and minor uses like making youtube thumbnails, but this year started to see genuine agentic ability in spaces like coding and abilities reaching a point where they can help with scientific research.

Being safe isn't the only metric to be a good taxi. Like sex work, taxi driving is a social job of vocation. You can replace the cognitive adaptations of it, not the soft social skills of it. What does it mean respecting signalization and driving code when you have someone bleeding out on your backseat? You're a liability.\n* I took Yann out of speed by releasing my own bespoke architecture, having a 1:1 functional model of a mice brain. It's ground breaking and I become a billionaire before next June. You still won't see any of it in your daily life, not next year, not ever. Because It's used only by suits for decision making. I build a SAP integration for it, and incorporate my module in their pricing. Their licence is in the million dollar, and I make maintenance contracts by the hour of work.\n* You're stuck with ChatGPT and you become dependent of it. You're trying to cure your psychological/mental health issues with it, to no avail. You die alone in some dark alley, homeless and forgotten.\n\n# 2) My more logical/scientific/skeptic-rationalist analysis\n\n* Yann LeCunn's research has some merits, but I find it too focused on the language/not language binary of it to really care about deeper architectural concerns. Distributing things helps, but where is my convolutional control network?\n* Waymo sells well for two reasons : It's genuinely safer than people, and Elon made it all the publicity it needed and then some. We live in an attention market society, so that might cover their finance for a while even technically hemorraging because of electric costs or any other infrastructural limitation. The bottom line? You don't care about any of this. I know it, you know it. It's the JavaScript of self driving cars : It's liked out of accessibility. If architecture constraints only defined success, it was dead from concept.\n* I haven't started working on anything, I'm just a critic. It's a fun place to sit at. You don't have to worry about me releasing anything.\n* You **are** dependent on generative transformer model uses. Your mild lack of critical thinking skills here attest of it. Your actual outcomes are not as grim as I've painted them, but you need to heed my warning here : Robots are not your friends. \"robot\" comes form a slavic language for \"Slave\". Machine serve, but you **have to** decide for yourself.\n* Because my prediction here is **exactly about** deciding for you, otherwise.\n\nAm I understood?",

GPT-6 could arrive June-July, representing the same capability leap as GPT-3 to GPT-4, capable of doing actual science versus GPT-5's glimmers, trained on roughly 4 GW compute with weeks-long context maintenance per Sam Altman's prediction. OpenAI's Garlic model (GPT-5.2 or 5.5) releases January-March with significant models beyond 5.2 coming in Q1 as stated plans. Meta's Avocado launches March 20-30, while Gemini 3 sees significant progress throughout the year according to Sundar Pichai's prediction.\n\nCompute Infrastructure\n\nOpenAI operates 2 GW and plans to triple compute while targeting 20 GW within roughly two years as a stated goal, though Sam Altman predicts they will likely fail to meet enterprise token demand. Anthropic deploys 1 million TPUs backed by more than 1 GW coming online as a stated plan. Luma begins deploying its 2GW supercluster (Project Halo) starting Q1 as a stated plan.\n\nWork & Enterprise\n\nThis represents a huge enterprise AI transformation year and major priority for OpenAI according to Sam Altman's stated focus. AI digital twins can technically do many white-collar jobs per Emad Mostaque's prediction, and AI will be the best coder by year end according to predictions. The Claude Code experience spreads beyond engineers to all knowledge work according to Anthropic's prediction, while software engineering \"goes utterly wild\" in speed and intensity per Anthropic's view. Early adopters see productivity hockey-stick growth according to predictions.\n\nRobotics\n\n1X Neo becomes available for delivery with 10,000+ units shipping, featuring fully autonomous household tasks as a stated plan. Figure aims for general purpose humanoid work in homes as a stated goal. First test deployments of home robots occur in early, limited, trial-style rollouts according to Anthropic's prediction.\n\nScience & Government\n\nProject Genesis sees the DOE unifying 17 national labs into an AI platform by mid-year with first discoveries expected by August per the executive order's stated plan. The DOD launches its AI Futures Committee by April as mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nProducts\n\nGoogle launches AI-powered XR smart glasses as a stated plan, while a possible OpenAI/LoveFrom IO device may arrive as a stated possibility. ChatGPT moves toward more interactive, task-specific, and proactive interfaces as a stated direction. AI agents handle complex multi-step tasks like shopping according to predictions.\n\nCapabilities\n\nModels stop feeling like autocomplete and start feeling like scary-smart colleagues according to predictions. Continual learning gets delivered satisfactorily per Anthropic's prediction. AI functions as genuine research \"interns\" according to Mark Chen's stated goal. Small scientific discoveries continue per Sam Altman's prediction, though he notes they began in late 2025.",

Conversations will start to shift more to jobs and other changes due to AI rather than what we have now where it's focused on downplaying AI. It will be on the news a lot more, presidents will talk about it a lot more, and so on. Basically the next set of models and the ones after it will be good enough to pass the threshold where it really starts to prove it's usefulness and will start assisting in research lot more (remember those posts about the erdos problems being solved, think of that but no handholding like the solution already existed online or we had to feed it a lot of context, and we begin to see announcements like that a lot more). The new models will be made with the new compute so it should be a big jump plus the new breakthroughs being implemented. There is a good chance a long standing difficult problem (probably not a millennium problem) will be solved or a new discovery altogether. Aside from that the usual typical stuff will happen also, better image models, video models, etc etc.\n\nTLDR: Public opinion starts to shift and people will start to realize it's the real deal and depression/existentialism starts to set in.
