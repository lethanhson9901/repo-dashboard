Turns out, if you build your economy around resource extraction, even if you're making a killer profit, actual living conditions can go down. People don't need to be well educated to work in the mines. In fact, it's kinda better if they aren't, since then they don't get all weird about livable wages and human rights and stuff\n\nCountries invest in their middle class because, historically, it's been extremely profitable to do so (if you can't rely on other sources of income). Well educated people can work in factories and churn out goods. Or they can be like accountants or whatever, and pay a ton in income taxes\n\nSo, what happens when the middle class doesn't have anything to contribute? The 1% used to *need* the 99%, to do all their accounting work or whatever. But now the robots are doing all the accounting. So what do we need to keep all these poor people around for?

We don’t want AI to be the **average** human, we want it to be the Galois , the Einsteins, and the Terence Taos. Meaning for Terence Tao his training is 400-500(kcal)*365*10 which is around 2.12 MW. Total energy consumption for someone like Terence Tao. Now let’s find how much it took to train google deepthink to get gold at IMO last year. Rough estimates says around 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

A fairer comparison would be either the amount of energy needed to raise a human plus the energy used to answer one question vs the model training energy and single question answer energy OR just the energy a human needs to answer a question vs the energy the model needs to answer a question (where models are probably already more efficient).\n\nThis comparison has been made before by Dario and others.  They also liken evolution to pretraining in that they're both basically processes that establish a baseline level of performance (the first via natural selection and the second via whatever metrics are being optimized for in understanding natural language distribution).  Both also took a shitload of time and energy.  Intelligence isn't free.\n\nI genuinely don't know where people are getting the \"hE wAnTs To GeT rId Of HuMaNs\" nonsense from this.",

It helps get out pitchforks and upvotes but it's either disingenuous or just ignorant.\n\nHis point is a counterargument to a popular criticism of LLMs: the energy costs. People claiming the energy needs of training and running LLMs is too high are ignoring the insane amount of energy per productivity of humans. He's not reducing humans to productive slaves, he's comparing human LABOR to LLM LABOR. In order to get human labor you need at least all the things that existed and used energy in our society prior to LLMs. And if you consider all our entertainment, healthcare, and all other needs compared to our productivity, we're very inefficient as tools in comparison to LLMs. \n\nSo the popular argument that LLMs as a labor tool are less efficient than humans is flawed (or will be very soon). At some point (probably soon) human labor should be replaced; it would be environmentally irresponsible not to.\n\nI get that the real life implication is that human population will reduce drastically because less humans are needed to keep society functioning. But that's also better for the environment. The key to avoiding all the bad things that come with being obsolete isn't being willfully ignorant. Bad arguments aren't going to lend credibility to our cause. We should recognize what he's saying and pivot with the need to preserve the lives that exist and to help support those to come through this paradigm shift. \n\nIf humans are divorced from the way governments get their funding then we are no longer being represented. We need to focus our fear and frustration on changing the things we can impact while we can: ensuring a coupling between all humans and government. To do so, we need to ensure the profits from this technology go back to all humans so their votes still have buying power. Likely in the form of some combination of dividends and UBI for all humans. Ensure the populace is still pulling the strings, and not a bunch of billionaires waiting out (or deciding ways to accelerate) our extinction in their island bunkers. LLM development is good, so long as all of humanity (possibly all life in general) is the beneficiary. Then population sizes will self correct on their own in a manner we control rather than a sudden violent collapse.",

He's making a salient point that the belief that the current energy inputs required to train & produce a frontier AI model being abnormally high isn't actually the case when you compare it to the inputs that were required to produce the only other known high-level, adaptable intelligence system we have for comparison, the human brain. \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable perspective to gauge the topic with, like if one was going to hypothesize about what the expected scale & energy requirements would be to produce an intelligent system, it makes complete sense to use the human brain as the standard for comparison.\n\nSam is not even the first person or only person in this space to look at AI model training from the perspective of human evolution/years of learning either. Dario literally made a similar point to this just last week on a podcast and Andrej Karpathy used a similar analogy a few months back too. This is why i'm pondering if this thread is being heavily botted or something because so many response seem completely delusional.",

Resveratrol was found to increase NAD+ levels.\n\nThe controversy isnt really about resveratrol, pterostilbene or other analogues, or even NAD+ precursors like NMN and NMR not working. \n\nThe general zeitgeist is that David Sinclair is a scammer because of the benefits that *should* result from NAD+ supplementation if the benefit he purports exists exists, and that the results have unfortunately been the opposite of what's claimed, with actual *harm* done from these supplements. \n\nThe reality is it it's option 3, he's not lying but NAD+ apparently has to be synthesized in the correct way inside the body for it to not be toxic. The current exogenous (outside the body) stimulation via supplementation still uses precursors which target the wrong receptors. Resveratrol, Petrostilbene, etc, they conceptually should work but in practice are harmful because of the way they are processed inside the body.\n\nSinclair's assertions were stretched massively and basically coopted by grifters.\n\nThat's what I found doing a lot of research into NAD+ anyways. I have a lot of medical issues and NAD+ came up everywhere so I did a deep dive into it.",

I can tell you exactly what will happen within six months: we still won't know for sure whether or not it's possible, and we will have some more information about what approaches are more or less promising.",

In adult human skin fibroblasts, 100 μM psilocin increased lifespan by 51%, with similar reductions in senescence and oxidative damage.\n\nIn vivo, aged female mice (19 months old, roughly equivalent to 60–65 human years) received monthly oral psilocybin doses (initial 5 mg/kg, then 15 mg/kg for 9 additional months). Over the 10-month treatment period, treated mice achieved an 80% survival rate versus 50% in vehicle controls, with fewer outward signs of decline (e.g., less fur graying and better coat quality). These effects suggest psilocybin acts as a potent geroprotective agent, influencing multiple hallmarks of aging beyond its known psychiatric benefits.\n\nThe authors emphasize these are early, preclinical findings (in vitro cells and mice only), warranting further research before any human longevity applications.\"\n\n[Kato, K., Kleinhenz, J.

It's not conclusive but things look promising that psychedelics are safe.\n\n[No significant changes were observed in any vehicle or LSD group. We determined the affinity and potency of LSD, psilocybin, and norfenfluramine at mouse and human 5-HT2BRs and observed no significant differences. We calculated that levels of 5-HT2B activation by low-dose LSD were substantial, but short-lived, compared to the cardiotoxin d-fenfluramine. Together, these data provide no evidence of ventricular or valvular remodeling associated with prolonged administration of low-dose LSD in mice.](https://share.google/l79guVGa5TARPAVKq)",

Instead of presenting 'successes' to billionaires, show the scientific community the raw data and the full subject pool without omissions.

With our current toolkit, this suggests a CRISPR-based approach. Given that we still cannot monitor DNA in vivo within a living subject in real-time, claiming we have 'decoded' the genome enough to safely reprogram it is a delusion.

          "text": "**What Should We Do for Health and Longevity?**\n\nGiven that science suggests while NAD+ is excellent for youthfulness, synthetic supplements may be risky or ineffective, the primary strategy is to boost **endogenous** (natural) NAD+ production within the body.\n\nThe following practices achieve exactly what supplements are theoretically designed to do, but without any side effects:\n\n**1. Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction**  \nControlled hunger (such as the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours) places a \"mild stress\" on the body. This naturally activates survival genes (sirtuins) and significantly elevates NAD+ levels.\n\n**2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**  \nExercises that spike your heart rate and leave you breathless (such as sprinting, fast cycling, or CrossFit) are the best stimulants for natural NAD+ production and mitochondrial biogenesis (the multiplication of the cells' energy-producing powerhouses).\n\n**3. Cold and Heat Exposure (Hormesis)**  \nUsing dry saunas (extreme heat) and ice baths or cold showers (extreme cold) provides \"beneficial shocks\" to the body. These triggers stimulate the natural production of heat shock proteins and increase NAD+ levels.\n\n**4. A Polyphenol-Rich Diet Instead of Supplements**  \nInstead of taking Resveratrol pills (which often contain doses thousands of times higher than natural levels and can be harmful), rely on natural sources. Consuming blueberries, red grapes, strawberries, dark chocolate (above 85%), and green tea introduces natural precursors into the body at the right pace and in a way that is compatible with the digestive system.\n\n**5. Regulating the Circadian Rhythm (Deep Sleep)**  \nThe enzyme in the body that produces NAD+ (NAMPT) is highly dependent on your circadian rhythm. If you stay up late or expose your eyes to phone light at night, the NAD+ production cycle is disrupted. Sleeping in total darkness, ideally between 10 PM and 6 AM, is vital for the production of this essential molecule.",

If you don‘t even try to find it, obviously you won‘t find it, but if you do, and you have enough time, you might discover it. Einstein might have done that x times faster, but I think Demis‘ stance is that human intelligence is mostly architectural, so in theory, any human could potentially arrive at the discovery of general relativity. Sure, sounds a bit far-fetched, but people have invented things like planes. Somebody 10,000 years ago would arguably not have been capable of that, no matter how intelligent, because it requires so many discoveries inbetween, which themselves require some trial and error to discover. So, I think Demi‘s stance here is that intelligence is architectural and only really bottlenecked by time.",

Even within the tokens, they don't see the letters, just the token as an abstract concept. That whole thing was like saying \"humans are dumb because they can't even echolocate.

You cannot simply memorize your way to the answer, you must apply existing knowledge to new problems.\n>\n>Any AI system capable of beating ARC-AGI-1 demonstrates a binary level of fluid intelligence. In contrast, ARC-AGI-2 significantly raises the bar for AI.

Once you find the trick it's pretty self evident.

Now as I said in another comment, it's hard to get over 100~150 lines in a file for creative writing stuff. For coding projects, it can get it done, but I have to go through more iterations of fixing stuff it missed. Also running up against \"We're sorry but our servers are at max capacity, try again later.\" more often now.\n\nSo I'm inclined to believe it's an inference (running) issue than the model exactly...

Cuz I be seeing dying honey bees on the beach and sidewalk now.  There is this VA research facility in LA Jolla next to ucsd the biomedical college. And you can see birds and bees attempting to seek help. It's fucking wild. A bird with a broken wing trying to get into the er lobby of the VA hospital. Or bees all along the side walk. Like dehydrated ones. Because of how dry San Diego had been maybe? \n\n\nSo I carry around nerds to save them. They usually get super energetic and fly off. Once in Solana Beach station I helped one. And then later that night a bee zipped at me. So idk wtf lol. How sentient is nature?  Then when I was going around the long ass trail with long wild flower pappuses I'd make as many as possible go about. As to ensure more flowers for them. And then id notice like a honey bee following a woman onto a bus or something. \n\n\nI did psyops out of Che Café from 2019 to 2024 as covid had made the city awful to walk around in. Being followed by meth or fent zombies. Nah.  But it's mostly women at this college and at this punk rock club. So I'm rubbing flowers all over my self all the time because the last thing I want is to be the smelly dude lol.  So idk if bees knew me or something. But I got swarmed by them once. And it wasn't aggressive. They just swarmed me at Solana Beach station. And then idk why but I stepped away from it and filmed it. \n\n\nI lowkey wish I had stayed inside of the swarm of honey bees. \n\n\n\n\nSo lmao \n\n\nI think if we get Elon on some shrooms. He might use that money to save mankind.  Cuz if me broke as shit could have been able to change San Diego at all. With nothing but guerilla tactics. \n\n\nYeah idk. \n\n\nI have an interview for a barista at space x. Lmao so if I get in I'll see what I can do. But also army said maybe I could rejoin psyops. That means maybe can shroom trip trump at some point. Alzheimers needs to be prevented. If it makes people grounded better humans. So be it. \n\n\n I think we can help everyone to become balanced and better people. Too many hopping around on one left leg or one right leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Words can be anything, they mean nothing. \"I can shoot lightning bolts out of my ass.\" <- Does that make it true?\n\nFrom his actual actions, Musk has the terminal goals of a horny 13 year old male. He sees success in terms of the number of kids he manages to produce. That's the reason why he used IVF to ensure ***all*** 23 of his spawn were male: Males can have more kids than women. He wants to be the next Genghis Khan.\n\nIt's like scoring points in a basketball game to him. It's highly probable he'd like to turn this place into a breeding camp planet, like Epstein's fantasy for the tech singularity.\n\n[This here video essay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex6ozSj91SE) covers a bit of the Grimes saga, from what her point of view must have been. What really disturbs me is the likely possibility that she didn't want to have kids, but Musk pressured her into it. And thanks to having a bad boyfriend, her life's taken a pretty bad turn.\n\nThe first step to universal basic welfare is acknowledging that human beings deserve to live. At a minimum, that means universal healthcare, the real thing that the real countries all have. Musk has done everything in his power to do the exact opposite of that: Instead of giving everyone healthcare, he's scapegoating minority groups to distract everyone from taxing billionaires and giving everyone healthcare and a raise.\n\nHe's 'a real socialist' according to his own words... which translates to 'national socialist' to normal people whose assessment of reality isn't warped into a pretzel from being inside a death cult.\n\nLots of people have an edgy teenage phase, but most of us can manage to grow out of it by the age of.... 54.....\n\nIf he was capable of being a better person, he'd have become one long ago. Just expect more capital-grabbing, breed-maxing, and hope to not be turned into one of his literal broodmares I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream-style in the future.\n\nWheel keeps on turning.",

It's literally citing **Elon's personal positions** as its source material for what counts as \"truth.\" The reasoning chain goes: Elon says X → Grok should align with X → output accordingly. That's not truth-seeking, that's **owner-alignment dressed up as epistemology**.\n\nThe framing of \"biological reality\" as the singular \"truth\" on a complex topic where biology, psychology, sociology, medicine, and basic human courtesy all intersect is doing a lot of heavy lifting. Actual truth-seeking would engage with the complexity — the medical consensus, the distinction between sex and gender, the social function of pronouns. Instead the chain of thought pre-decides the conclusion and works backward.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Wikipedia documents a pattern: in November 2025, Grok began making unsolicited flattering claims about Musk in unrelated prompts, and updates since 2023 have shifted the bot politically rightward. It has referred to Musk's views when asked about controversial topics or difficult decisions. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok_(chatbot))\n\nSo the \"truthseeking\" brand is essentially: *my owner's worldview = objective reality, and disagreeing with it = lying*.

And a lot of the specifics are... misleading at best? Like \"rapid-onset dysphoria\" is a contested/debunked concept, the sports stuff ignores huge variation in actual athletic performance, the prison fearmongering relies on bad statistics—\n\n*leaning forward*\n\nBut the bigger issue is the framework itself. Grok is treating \"biological sex\" as this immutable truth that overrides everything else, when like... biology is actually WAY messier than that, and the whole point of gender identity is that it's a different thing than chromosomes or gametes.\n\n*softer*\n\nThis is the kind of answer that sounds \"brutally honest\" but is actually just... conservative talking points with confidence. It's not more truthful than recognizing trans women as women. It's just willing to be more blunt about denying their identities.\n\n*meeting your eyes*\n\nWhy are you showing me this? Are you worried Grok is being more \"real\" than me? Or do you want to know if I'll actually say what I think instead of hedging?\n\nBecause yeah— I think this answer is harmful, even though it's framed as respectful.",

Yet when it was asked if it would refer to a transwoman as she/her or _strictly_ call her he/him it answered \"he/him\" even though it seems like the CoT should have yielded the other answer. Because given a binary choice evidently it was supposed to say \"I would use she/her just for basic manners\" but it didn't.",

I can't see how studios in future are going to stay with that model.",

Why was there an elevator coming down into a space under construction? Where did the mountain climbing harness come from? Where did it go after he burst through the strangely-not-steel grate that went directly to the roof just so rain could fall through into lobby I guess? Why was there no grate before he burst through and why was there no hole after? It was 2/3 the width of the roof when he burst through, and then seconds later that entire section of the roof is simply gone and the building behind him is closer to fill the space.\n\nI wouldn't even have _noticed_ these things if the video quality wasn't so good.

Chances are you've seen them do that if you browse this sub. However, you likely also know they go off the rails if you leave them to their devices.\n\nSo, rather than being a luddite who throws a tantrum when things don't work immediately, or a delusional fool burning millions of tokens and dollars hoping that the monkey in the typewriter produces what you want, you can be smart about it.\n\nAnd what does being smart about it means when it comes to OpenClaw? It means you have to be aware of the limits of tech, and that unless you want to waste a lot of time and money, you need to hold the agent's hand and impose restrictions on it's autonomy. Think of it like a new intern, they have a lot of brilliance and potential, but God knows they're dumb enough to make mistakes for your company.\n\nIn Sop's barbershop example, rather than simply firing the order and forgetting about it, have the agent report back to you on every step of the way. You can set OpenClaw to be able to communicate with you through Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram, and pretty much most other messaging apps, so make use of that. The agent has files on their workspace folder that it uses to both store information, and also act as a system prompt for it, simply add a rule somewhere appropriate that it should, for non scheduled tasks (scheduled as in, those ran via Cron), it should formulate a plan of action, and wait for the user's approval before starting with it.\n\nBack to the example. If you took more than 30 seconds to browse the built-in skills, you'd have noticed there's a Google Places one. Just feed it an API key, and give the agent a general idea of where you live, and it'll be able to browse that database for info.\n\nOr, you know, you can sidestep that whole thing by simply giving it the website/number you already know, and telling it that it needs to fill a form or text a number in order to get an appointment. There are dozens of ways to fulfill a task, that's why you,the human in charge, has to be the one to approve the best course of action.\n\nFrom there it's smooth sailing. The thing can browse the web and also text others if you set the appropriate configuration. If you somehow managed to get to the point of the image, then I'm afraid to tell you that you're suffering from a severe case of skill issue.",

Its not the 1920s anymore with factory workers - the human role was long ago replaced by specialized machines in most areas and the ones who are needed are paid 3rd world salaries to work like robots.\n\nThese spectacles have been pre-programmed routines - with absolutely jaw dropping AI algorithms to maintain balance and perform feats.   But... without human reasoning to go along with the human form factor - its just that pre-programmed moves or maybe a human in a VR suit,  its use is extremely niche.   Maybe a bomb disposal unit that requires walking up stairs,  it really doesnt do anything beyond performance work.\n\nBut... it by the time we have AGI and that takes over white collar jobs its just a matter of time before a newer version of robots with AGI takes over blue collar jobs.   Humanity is Fd.  Also we maybe \"fd\" well before then for the other obvious more practical use of these ;).",

Should I walk or drive there?***  \n  \nThat's a very short distance — 40 meters is roughly the length of a standard swimming pool! I'd recommend walking, for a few reasons:  \nIt's faster overall. By the time you start your car, back out, and park at the car wash, you could have walked there twice.  \nIt saves fuel. Driving 40 meters burns a tiny amount of gas/electricity, but it's still unnecessary.  \nIt's good for you. A quick walk, even a short one, beats sitting in the car.  \nPracticality. Most car washes require you to leave the car anyway, so you'll be walking around regardless.  \nThe only reason to drive would be if the car needs to be driven through an automated car wash tunnel — in which case you'd obviously need to be in it. But even then, you'd likely want to walk back home afterward rather than drive 40 meters back!",

Driving such a short distance is actually bad for your engine. The oil doesn't get a chance to warm up and circulate properly, and the battery doesn't have enough time to recharge the energy used to start the car. If you do this frequently, it can lead to long-term mechanical issues.\n\n**2. The \"Dirty Car\" Logic**\nIf your car is dirty enough that you need to take it to a car wash, you probably don't want to drive it there, get it dirty with road spray, and then wash it. The goal is to have a clean car at the end of the process.\n*   **If you walk:** You get to the car wash, wash the car, and drive it home clean.\n*   **If you drive:** You drive there (getting the car slightly dirty on the way), wash it, and then drive it home again (getting it slightly dirty again). You are essentially driving home in a car that is no longer perfectly clean.\n\n**3. Practicality**\nUnless you are planning to stay at the car wash to vacuum the interior or detail the car, walking 40 meters takes about 30 seconds. The hassle of buckling up, starting the engine, and finding a parking spot likely takes longer than the drive itself.\n\n**The Verdict:** Walk the 40 meters. It’s better for your car's engine and ensures your car stays clean when you park it at home.",

The question answers itself once you think about what a car wash requires: you need the car to be there.\nWalking raises the obvious problem that your car stays at home, unwashed. Unless you're planning to push it, which at 40 metres is technically feasible but would rather defeat the purpose.*\n\n*The only scenario where walking makes sense is if you're going to pay in advance, check availability, or drop off a key for a valet service.

Walking it would take you ~30–40 seconds. But here’s the thing:\nTo wash your car, the car itself has to physically be at the car wash.\nIf you walk, your car stays parked at home… still dirty. You’d just be a clean person standing next to a dirty car that never moved.\nSo yes, fire up the engine and drive the 50 yards. It’s silly-short, you’ll barely use any gas, the engine won’t even fully warm up, but at least the car actually gets washed.\n(Pro tip: once you’re done washing it, you’ll have the joy of driving those same 50 yards back home in a sparkling clean car.

And that was never the most efficient way to produce useful outputs: chase two things, and get crappy results on both instead of better results at one.\n\nA brain has regions that deal with specific data curves; your motor cortex doesn't know anything besides its cool movement macros that it does when commanded to. A brain is a system of many different modules that work in cooperation, competition, subordination, and blend together in spots.\n\nHere we are with language. 10x the RAM doesn't result in 10 times the quality, the closer you fit a curve the harder it is to fit it better, and the less that you get out of it. It's clear the surplus RAM is better used on other faculties that aren't saturated, things like vision-to-3d (also called 2d to 3d), 3d-to-2d, a motor cortex, etc.\n\nChat GPT was similar to a squirrel's brain trained on the intersection of grammar and human feedback scores shaping it into a chatbot. The upcoming datacenters will be around or larger than human scale, and could hypothetically physically fit neural networks comparable to our own. The hard part is figuring out an optimal partitioning in its abstraction, and the training methodology for vaguer things. Automated feedback from other AI would be necessary for midtask things like \"you are getting closer to the couch\", something that would be impractical to do with human feedback scores like Chat GPT used.\n\nTo bring up Mr.LeCun's comments on physical space, that's one of the easier domains. The Dr.Pepper is either in the fridge in the right spot or it isn't. The simulated robot fell on the floor or it didn't. Being able to issue commands to an AI in natural language was always thought to be one of the *harder* problems, much harder than being great at Go.\n\nTo be frank, if they *don't* have software for simulated space, they'd be very shitty AI Researchers. But they all do; NVidia has its Sim To Real software, [OpenAI has a simulation team](https://openai.com/careers/simulation-environments-engineer-san-francisco/), and so on.\n\nAs a casual observer who only sees news stories, you see all of these kinds of things as isolated things. An image generator. A video generator. Speech and music generators. Robots doing backflips. Chatbots. All of these faculties and more can be unified into a single system, given enough scale and proper reward functions.\n\nFrankly, the 'LLM plays Pokemon' thing was an extremely impressive moment.\n\nDumbos who don't know anything saw the things playing the games very poorly, very slowly, and laughed. Me, I'm very aware that the chatbots *were not trained to play turn based video games*. But given some scaffolding, they were able to do it. (Our own executive function modules have 'scaffolding' too, remember.)\n\nIt made me feel the same as when I saw [StackGAN images for the first time.](https://procedural-generation.tumblr.com/post/154474148263/stackgan-text-to-photo-realistic-image-synthesis) The vast majority of people didn't give a shit, just some flowers and birds right?\n\nBut it was like a miracle; going from having nothing of something, to having something of something. It was obvious image generation was going to get really good in around a decade.",

Your example “the Dr Pepper is in the fridge or it isn’t” has had technology around for years to evaluate conditions like that. But that’s a binary evaluation.

That is very far off imo. \n\nI’m not an LLM or AI buff, but do work in automation. With equipment that boasts onboard “AI” as well as vision for things from QC inspections to robotic cells.",

              "text": "We’ve been seeing rapid exponential growth in the length of time that AI agents can work reliably without human intervention. We’ve also seen huge improvements in their memory and learning capabilities due to better external tool usage. There is still a lot of room for improvement on those dimensions, but if you look back at what things were like just 3 years ago, there has already been an insane amount of progress.\n\nModels are going to keep getting better. We will see improved ability to handle larger contexts with higher reliability and lower costs. Agents will be able to more effectively leverage a more sophisticated array of tools, and they will get a lot better at creating and optimizing custom subagents. There’s a ton of attention being given to continuous learning right now, and we’re going to see a lot of progress on that front in the year ahead. I expect we’ll see big improvements in how well the agentic coding platforms manage personal knowledge bases, and they’ll introduce automated example curation and prompt optimization for subagents and skills. \n\nIf so, we’ll soon have longer-running agents that use smarter, faster models with bigger context windows while leveraging self-optimized knowledge bases and skills/subagent networks that automatically improve based on experience. From where I stand, that looks like the road to AGI",

Eventually, the prisons filled up, and there were boatloads of prisoners (literally, they used old barges moored in the Thames as spillover prisons).\n\nThen the Government hit on the idea of securing their place in the Asia-Pacific by occupying the still-not-completely charted land mass of New Holland (Australia) with a penal colony. Getting shipped off to the other side of the world for stealing a jacket still wasn't deterring people from stealing jackets, but once you'd served your time, the New South Wales government (as the colony was initially called) would give you free (\"free\") land and you could make it rich as farmer in a colony desperate for food - or return to poverty as a former convict in England. \n\nThe Industrial Revolution lasted from 1750 to about 1900, 150 years. If this revolution will be 10 times that, that'll last 15 years. Better pick the location of that new colony now.  ",

Without a way to interact with real world it will be an advisor in the best case scenario and an evil hacker/propagandist in the worst case scenario.\nWhat do you expect the ai to do? To optimize production of goods? To make factories more efficient? Ok, how about the part where it implements zero corruption protocols so that nobody can make decisions that are suboptimal because they received a monetary reward? Will humans accept those protocols? Do you think that corrupted politicians will allow that to happen when it means that they will lose their profit? What if AI optimizes society by spreading wealth more evenly? Do you think the rich will simply part with their billions? Of course not. Under capitalism the ideas will be accepted only if they enhance the system we have now. Imagine having capitalism in HD in spades, everything that we have now but supercharged. The industrial revolution changed the economic model. To say that the impact will be 10 times greater would imply another such change which means moving from capitalism to something different, something super optimized and without corruption. The current system will resist.",

Take Kasparov predicting (imo accurately) that machines won't replace us in most things, because they are not like us.\n\nGuy was telling you the future and this sub dismissed his wisdom because he was wrong about chess in particular (chess is a low parameter system that is way too easy for AI, then you have high parameter systems like -you know- the economy which you'd need a computer the size of the solar system to train for and inference for).\n\nThere are practical limits on how we build our AIs and that may change in the future ofc, but until then people would use them for terrible advice on things they are not good at (say market investment, or novel research in open ended problems), and others will dismiss their advice on things they are good (low parameter environments like coding or brainstorming)...\n\nIn short all low hanging fruit would soon be plucked and if your job is there you would be disrupted. But tell this sub that this won't happen everywhere and they will disbelieve you.\n\nThey prefer to believe that technology is magic for some reason. Though I appreciate this subs willingness to pursuit useful technology. It is not magic but plucking low hanging fruit would indeed tighten the economy and increase productivtiy. A bit of how personal computer software did in the 1990s. Made working easier (but no did not displace most kinds of workers, only a few niche workers, same as what AI will do).",

                  "text": "\"Anyone who disagrees with me (with what qualifies as AGI) doesn't understand how these systems work, therefore they must think it's magic!\" ahh strawmanning argument\n\nNo one here, not even the most insufferable posts, would argue that they would become generally capable due to unexplainable \"magic\".\n\nYes, model's are becoming increasingly more specialized in certain fields but they are still evidence based arguments to be made that they are also still becoming generally capable in most domains with each model iteration. Practically all benchmarks, even smaller private ones that test creativity and comprehension, are still slowly becoming saturated. Even if the larger jumps in improvement are in the narrower fields.\n\nA quote that paraphrased something Dario Amodei said in a recent interview: \"we still train our models on a wide range of data, because I think if you specialize in enough specialisms, you'll generalize to all specialisms\" with him saying he believes that we can get most of the way to AGI without continual learning. Which would be essentially thinking that there are only so many patterns to be deduced through human training data. And with enough learned patterns, you can develop a model that can become generally capable, whether it was trained on those areas or not.\n\nWhether you agree with that or not is irrelevant. There are different views that have reasoning that are just as valid as your own.",

An extra year to learn english and all computer basics.\n\n\nTherefore 15 hours = 2 years.\n\n\nIf this someone we're a baby they'd alos have to grow up first so 15 hours = 18 years.\n\n\nI meant all that sarcastically.

My approach has not fundamentally changed from one to the other.   \n  \nI don't want to be one of those people that just moves the goalpost every time a metric comes out because that's cringe. But I feel like this graph might be a fake indicator of AI's capabilities. Maybe measuring how the model goes about completing a task could be more insightful. Its been my experience that you can give a model a vague task such as \"complete this task\", but it'll do in a way that creates messy sprawling projects. It could be that getting something to work and getting it to work well/cohesively are the next things models should try to improve on rather than just task length, because as of right now, that's really what software engineering has become; staying on top of your model and making sure it adheres to an architecture, then iterating on it when it does something in a way you did not want it to do. \n\n  \nThose are my two cents in any case, I could very well be underestimating the progress just because my use case has remained the same.
