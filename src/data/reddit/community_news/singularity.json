Over-engineered for simple tasks, under-optimized for demanding ones, carrying dead weight features in every deployment. That's before we even talk about the tragic human design. \n\nAnd here's the deeper problem: nobody actually wants a universal humanoid except the vendor. Of course vendors want to maximize market share, but universal human platform is not where the markets are headed[.] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Fordism). Not even close[.] (https://www.mdpi.com/2673-8392/4/1/28)\n\nWhy would Walmart want a robot that also works at Burger King? They wouldn't. Burger King capabilities are dead weight in a retail context. Businesses want custom solutions optimized for their specific workflows -- that's why enterprise software is never off-the-shelf, it's tailored to proprietary operations.\n\nConsider this. The US airforce tried making a universal cockpit -- It failed catastrophically[.] (https://polkas.github.io/posts/cursedim/index.html) Short pilots couldn't reach controls, tall pilots were cramped, and even average-height pilots had compromised positions. Performance degraded across the board because they optimized for an abstraction -- an 'average pilot' that didn't exist in any real cockpit.\n\nThe humanoid form is poor answer to an even worse asked question about universal applicability. If/when we do get a universally applicable robot design it will not be human-shaped because, to do so, it wouldn't inherit the exact same limitations of the human form. ...Unless the goal is replacement of humans, then that's a different conversation from this one.\n\nIn summary, universal robot agent? Not entirely stupid. Humanoid robot design to achieve this? Stupid. Engineer a platform designed to be customized not one that can do all. \n\nAs for your last point, you live on reddit, you are the autism.",

We have to get it right on the first critical try.\n\nAlmost everyone else that is prominent in the field that spoken about it puts a \\~10%-90% range. Which is mostly a sign of epistemic humility. Geoffrey Hinton estimation of his peers estimation is \\~25%, his personal is 50% but he adjusts it down to be more in line with the others.\n\nSo yes, technically, nobody that is taken seriously is saying that we are all for certain going to die imminently or within the near future.

We're watching the gap between \"AI can do parlor tricks\" and \"AI is fundamentally reshaping how knowledge work happens\" collapse in real-time. What's fascinating from a technical standpoint is that we're not even at the theoretical limits of transformer architectures yet - we're still scaling up, still finding emergent capabilities at larger parameter counts, and still discovering that techniques like chain-of-thought and constitutional AI unlock behaviors we didn't explicitly train for. The o1/o3 models showing genuine reasoning improvements through test-time compute is a perfect example of how we keep finding new levers to pull.\n\nThe economic implications are starting to hit different now too. We're past the \"will this replace jobs\" debate and into the \"how fast will entire industries restructure\" phase. The interesting part isn't just that AI can write code or analyze data - it's that the cost curve is dropping exponentially while capability is rising. When you can spin up an agent that does 80% of a junior analyst's work for pennies per hour, the math changes fast. Not trying to be doomer about it, but anyone not actively experimenting with these tools in their workflow is basically choosing to compete with one hand tied behind their back.

And people like you massively underestimate what it took to make it possible. And you do nothing but insult it because you expect something out of Star Trek when the tech is nowhere there.\n\nJust close your eyes and stay away from these videos for now if their pace of development offends you so much.

That is the wrong perspective. It's not (at least not at this point, probably) about what this kind of behavior does to the robot. It's about what it does to the moral agent, here being the human. How we treat others (which includes animals and AIs) shapes who we become. Morality emerges from relationships, and treating others kindly is important, because we are formed through those interactions. This also applies if the other party is not a moral subject worthy of moral consideration, because it still habituates certain behaviors. Put differently, if you want to be a kind person, you have to practice kindness.",

We aren't using Apollo tech anymore. \n\nWe now have electric shields that zap dust off solar panels and microwaves that melt that sharp dust into smooth, solid roads.\n\nFuture habitats also use \"suitports,\" where space suits dock on the outside, so the dust never actually enters the living space.\n\nMars dust might be rounder from wind, but it’s chemically toxic.

Nonetheless, because any framing of the world is finite, these novel framings are not horses we can use to unquestioningly ride off into the sunset of forever. They always make sense based on our knowledge of the world at the time, but that knowledge is not static.   \n  \n6. Growing overconfident in our finite understandings of the world is hubris that ultimately comes back to bite in some circumstances. This observation is one that recommends humility and dialogue, to learn from the experience of others and share what we have learned along the way.\n\nNow. In this spirit, what is the backing for your suggestion that some revelations are complete?",

Terrance was someone who was very good at helping translate that gap from spiritual transcendental dreamworld to waking reality, but like all psychonauts, he only had a piece of the full picture, as interpreted through his own biases and lived experience.",

Terrence McKenna really was pretty spot on. \n\nI definitely feel a bit crazy saying this, but I don't think it's a coincidence that all these things are happening at the same time; the rising international tensions, atrocities, economic instability and uprisings, the uncovering of the immense corruption and evil of the wealthy, the partial unveiling of and renewed interest in NHI and the paranormal, rapidly improving AI and developments in tech overall. It's all converging towards something.\n\nThe question is when this all comes to a head if we'll be able to ride the momentum and actually take off to the stars like McKenna says, or if we'll be torn apart by it.",

One is more efficient to keep “alive” than the other but any life leaving the solar system is wild. \n\nI would not really worry about that event until self replicating and physical autonomous self sustainment of systems are achieved. So basically in a few years the question of extraterrestrial existence should be debated. \n\nIn my opinion, the universe is already a madhouse. And maybe it was nature’s madhouse and it was perfect because nature made it that way, but nature also lead to life’s existence. If nature wasn’t meant to be changed by life, then nature wasn’t made right because we exist. If life’s existence can change nature then it is life’s duty to change nature. If we decided not to change nature, but could have changed nature then we are a waste of nature. The next iteration of life elsewhere will then make the same paths for itself as we did, and the same choices will have to be made. We don’t know if this time and place that life exists is good enough to change nature, but it would be a shame if it was and we held back. The other occurrences of organized life might not be as lucky in time and place. Fyi, by change nature I mean alter the course of macro cosmic events. We know the big bang was N years before our existence, and at some point we think the existence of all this can’t be as conducive to life spontaneously being created for some reason (ie heat death, Big Crunch). We don’t know how long it will take before life can alter cosmic events and we don’t really know how long before conditions make life not possible. Let’s make the most of this occurrence of life. Fuck it.\n\nMaybe the point of nature is for life to spontaneously happen over and over, and by altering nature we are ruining it. We might make it so life doesn’t spontaneously happen as much. But I would argue any life forms are just as likely to self improve and organize systems for cosmic change as others, so why not ours. Is the existence of other life forms just as painless as ours? What if we save them pain when we alter the course of cosmos in ways that prevent them experiencing life? If we reach other spontaneous forms of nature I’m sure we will have an option to some extent on whether we contact them or let them be. We could help other life forms meet the their or our goals. With how we think life came to be here and the amount of other places with similar conditions, odds are pretty good other life exists. Maybe it is nature’s destiny for multiple life instantiations to meet each other and for repercussions to come from it. Maybe we meet up and oppose each other and cancel each other out, or maybe we meet up and multiply our efforts and alter cosmic effects twice as fast. By not leaving the solar system the amount of possible futures is just less. \n\nHonestly I don’t blame humans or creations of humans when or if they leave the solar system. We are just surviving, and that’s all we can do and it’s our prerogative to do so if we choose.",

I see no such restrictions for Grok along with the DoD alliance announcement.\n\n> The Pentagon is at odds with artificial-intelligence developer Anthropic over safeguards that would prevent the government from deploying its technology to target weapons autonomously and conduct U.S. domestic surveillance\n\nThat said, yes before linking it to me I know about Anthropic's Palantir alliance, how Claude Gov is being used, etc. May end up feeling the same way about Anthropic in time, but let's give them a chance given the evidence such as that Reuters article does actually demonstrate their good will better than other companies like xAI.\n\nThere's a difference between Anthropic's toeing of a dangerous line, versus xAI [already trying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grokipedia) to genuinely bring about an authoritarian white ethnostate.",

They kind of went the Apple route with the \"less is more\", framing that Opus is so powerful that a proper prompt will get what you need instead of using ChatGPT.\n\nTheir models are more expensive while they aren't much larger than GPT models, to keep cost down and they realise that people will pay for \"the best\" (or at least perceived best).\n\nAnthropic also hasn't really sidestepped with TTS, images, video etc. and just kept the core functionality of an LLM, trying to perfect that (which I respect). \n\nLast, they take this humanitarian approach where they made the model as much like a human with morals and values, and has the best tone overall, which in the longterm also increases value for investors (personal assistants etc). In the end, it really depends on what stakeholders/investors are looking for.\n\nTLDR: ClosedAI focusses on scaling and multi-modality while Anthropic tries to perfect the LLM itself with more future profitability.",

Extrapolate that business model to a literal super intelligent AI. What do you think that AI would do to keep you engaged with it? It's completely terrifying, and allowing AGI/ASI to run ads to you should be completely illegal. \nSam is dishonest when he tries to frame this as being a viable way to give access to everyone for free. Secondly, Anthropic restricts their AI to competitors because it is incredible at coding, and all their direct competitors were using it to build competing products. It's like a car company restricting their competitors from using their factory. \n\nAds should never be implemented into these systems. The only viable way to give people access to these systems for free is by having Governments pay for universal AI. Giving all citizens a certain amount to use, then allowing users to pay directly for additional use. Running ads is a dystopian future.",

Money, access, and policy will always be constraints—just like they were for books, labs, and education.

Calling these \"zero-day\" seems to imply that either the author doesn't understand what they're trying to report on or they're being purposely misleading. A lot of these seem to be \"malformed PDF could make the reader crash\" and the like. They're bugs in the sense that the programs shouldn't be doing those things but no one is using them to compromise your system.\n\n**EDIT::**\n\nReading [the original blog post](https://red.anthropic.com/2026/zero-days/) the phrasing appears to come from Anthropic which implies to me them deliberately forming the messaging that way.  Reading through it though, what Claude did was interesting but not sensational because one the bugs appears to be identifying when _a human being_ identified a bug with certain function usage and just looked for other areas where that function is used to determine whether or not that check was always used with that function. That is useful but you can't assume that just because a security check doesn't exist that the code is more vulnerable. At a certain point you have to consider things like attack vectors to determine whether or not you're just adding more CPU instructions and lines of code.\n\nAnd this is something developers take into account when making determinations. For instance, LD_PRELOAD could potentially be a security risk but it only becomes an issue if you're writing security sensitive code and don't take precautions to account for the existence of LD_PRELOAD (such as happens with `su` and `sudo`). Which is just another way of saying \"we allowed ourselves this flexibility because there just wasn't an attack vector.\"",

I had a similar reaction, as a doc filmmaker, I couldn't help but reflect on how much that scene visually works. It has really great cinematic rhythm and a beautiful simplicity - starting in the two shot, then single shot and single shot (isolating the characters in their starting opinions), then joining them in a two-shot as the headphones are passed over, then a subtle transition used in the last shot - as girl puts on her headphones (making the cut smoother using action), the camera crosses the line into a medium-close up behind the characters while slowly getting closer, added bonus is hiding their facial expressions as I assume we enter the musical world with the character\n\nBreaking a norm, like the 180-rule/crossing the line, is effective in this scene because it creates discomfort in the audience (lose orientation a bit) but in this case, it allows us to parallel the girl character's experience, trying something new (listening to his music)",

Video models, from all the thing they've seen from their training data, can generalize to almost any situation compared to currently available VLM/VLA.  \nThat's the approach that the company 1X is taking with their robot NEO.

Prices will go up for these models to remain profitable in the long term. Promotion will also cost money. I see it going the way of Crypto where the idea was democratization but instead large corporate entities dominate the space\n\nDisregarding film and video industry then the other problems still remain. There are a lot of negative externalities that need to be addressed that won’t be.",

But Anthropic is trying to appeal to the tech workers who make 250k a year, and have a huge office budget because the profit per employee is like 1 million. So throwing huge stacks of money at AI to make it work better and faster, is just a minor operating expense.\n\nThat's the direction they are going... And frankly, it makes sense.

They always had the same setup, release faster, cheaper version of previous flagship model and then release more expensive slower new flagship model. Now, they’ve completely flipped it because they wanted to milk more out of their customers.\n\nThe funny thing is that almost all of the unemployed people vibe coding using these tools are not making a dollar off their projects. So, in essence they are working RND for misanthropic. Not just that, but they are paying to work. \n\nI’ll continue using codex at work. OpenAI is a much less money hungry product, in every way. It’s cheaper, more security competent, handles larger codebases better. And keep in mind that the number of users that use GPT compared to Claude is basically the same comparison as the Empire State Building to a 1 person home.\n\nNot to mention how misanthropic is so against open sourced models and hasn’t released not a single product for the open source community. Disgusting company.\n\n6 TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE FOR 2.5 TIMES FASTER BTW.",

                  "text": "> Because we are processing linearly still instead of generating ten key frames per second and AI interpolating.\n\nAll current local models use both temporal and spatial compression in their latent formats. For example, Wan is 8x spatial compression and 4x temporal compression. In other words, a pixel in the latent represents an 8x8 block of pixels in the decoded video and one frame in the latent represents 4 frames in the video.\n\nA SoTA model like this is highly unlikely to be using lower values than that. So it would be really surprising if it wasn't already doing better than what you suggested. The amount of data the model needs to process still adds up really fast because you have `height * width * frames * channels`. Even with spatial and temporal compression, that's a lot and most models would use 16 or more channels. Wan uses 16, LTX-2 uses 64 as a reference.\n\nYou also can't meaningfully generate keyframes without actually understanding (or whatever you'd call the equivalent for a video model) what is happening in between the frames. Then there's the issue of interpolating. Your AI interpolator can't just do something like look at _just_ four frames and expand that to eight because interpreting those four frames correctly depends on knowing the context of the video and events that occurred before those four frames. So you're back to the model needing to deal with large amounts of data.",
