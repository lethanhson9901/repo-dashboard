              "text": "Your comment seems controversial, but from a productivity and efficiency standpoint, you're a system optimizer, and I don't see how optimization can be bad. Those who view the world as a system can see that reducing the load in one area makes room for more power elsewhere. When tractors were becoming widespread, maybe some laborers were concerned about losing their job at the farm, but for those who can, I don't see any of them complaining about being able to afford food. If there came along a machine that mass produced high quality cheap houses, would the average person would be concerned about carpenters and drywallers losing their jobs when they're finally able to afford a house?\n\nIn the end, increasing our productivity just increases the population we can support. Like self stabilizing ecosystems where an increase in one resource directly affects the population of the animals that consume it, the amount of food, power, and other resources we can produce per unit of work determines how many people we can support. Unlike ecosystems, we don't want starvation and predation to be the things that stabilize our population. If we want everyone in the future to be happy, well fed, somewhat equal, and so on, we will have to somehow artificially limit the population before we get to the starvation part. That's a really hard problem, because it's in our nature as animals to reproduce if we have the means, so I don't know how that's going to work. I don't see our productivity increasing exponentially beyond our growth, but maybe it will somehow with ASI, and we'll never be able to reproduce faster than productivity increases.\n\nAnyway, my point is that I think optimizations like you're doing is what's ultimately going to help everyone in the long run. Keep on doing your thing.",

A lot of the pressure this cycle got absorbed there instead of showing up as clean layoffs.\n\nThis isn’t the 70s or 90s. The labor market adjusts differently now. You can keep continued claims relatively flat while real wages fall, hours get cut, and households stretch themselves thinner just to tread water.\n\nSo I agree this contradicts the “everything is already collapsing” memes.

What you are getting (long before the advent of AI btw) is deterioration of the quality of the jobs, not job loss.\n\nAnd not enough is said about it. People expect to be left without a job. There is a worst fate, a dead end job that barely pays you enough to have the life that a generation or two ago had.\n\nAnd the above should be taken seriously, because we are seriously not seeing a rapid rise in unemployment.",

It was before the iPod and iTunes because about a week after every meeting we had with a record label we'd get a call to tell us Apple just paid them a visit to talk about the same thing.\n\nI put forward the idea of Netflix style streaming. I demo'd the whole system after ripping 700 DVDs from a local DVD rental vending machine, sitting outside in my car with a laptop, ripping and returning. We had the entire menu system, remote control etc. It all looks like Netflix does now. I was told \"Absolutely not! Nobody would ever give up their DVD collections. People like to show off their collections and they like to hold something physical. This idea is ridiculous, it will never happen.\" (This was at the same time everyone was giving up their CD collections)\n\nI used a lot of that knowledge later when working as a contractor for Microsoft/MSN helping out with the Windows Media Center/Extenders design etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m13g591k4ceg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee45eb2c68be203711197367044eb112775e72fb",

Description from Grok below because it explains better than I could. \n\n\"The company's core philosophy is to reimagine how talent, studios, and distributors relate, with a big emphasis on broader profit participation and equitable compensation. They aim to let more people (not just top stars or execs) share in a project's success, which directly counters the \"long tail\" of most workers staying in poverty while a few benefit hugely.\n\n\nKey examples from their approach:\n\nStarting with their debut film Air (2023), they've pledged to share profits more inclusively.\n\nFor recent projects like The Rip (a 2026 Netflix film starring Affleck and Damon, released mid-January), they secured a groundbreaking deal where the entire cast and crew—around 1,200 people—can get performance-based bonuses if the movie does well. This is unusual for Netflix/streaming, which historically hasn't shared upside that way, and Affleck has framed it as evolving the industry to maintain decent wages amid changes (including tech/automation pressures).\n\nAffleck has spoken about this as fundamental to why they started the company: to ensure people who contribute get to benefit if the work succeeds, rather than the old model where crew often don't share in hits.\"",

Here's the proof:\n\nIn the only video this fake influencer posted on YouTube so far (https://youtu.be/Xgv4xkhzufM?si=DxkUTqLAhQXNcBGP), many of the clips still have the Omegle.com watermark on it. However, Omegle.com shut down in November 2023 and is now replaced with Ome.tv. How can a dude who blew up in 2025 still be impressing girls on a site that shut down in 2023?\n\nThe clip at 5:57 was also clearly cut from one of Spanish streamer Kostyxd's old Omegle streams on YouTube. Kostyxd added Spanish subtitles to all of his old streams since his viewers were mostly from Spain at the time. Why else would this fake influencer randomly add Spanish subtitles to a conversation he's having in English, and only for this one clip out of all the clips he posted in that video? Clearly a stolen video and fake identity.",

At some point in their adult life this often becomes a problem but at that stage it's super hard to change something about it.\n\n\nOn the plus side if you have good character you'll likely have a much richer life. And getting fit and healthy not only transforms your body but also your face and overall looks: most people can improve 2-3 points if they invest in their health which also ups self-esteem which in return ups looks. If you're a 4 now you can become a 6 or even 7. And you'll appreciate it much more than someone who's born a 7 and likely won't be bound by looks.\n\nThis can btw also be observed when it comes to brains: smart people often have above average (top 10%) but not top tier (top 1%) income because they reach a 'good enough' level without much effort.\nSuccessful opportunists often are not the smartest people. Above average but not top causes you to take bigger risks more often, which at some point pays off eventually.\n\nPopular media renders all of this unfair. Truth is: most of us have a chance to have a good, fulfilling life. But you have to live the life that works best for you and not chase the life you see others have. I guess that's what religion often calls 'fate', and imo there's a grain of truth in it.",

So they’re probably just gonna act like normal people because what was in that video doesn’t happen to regular people, even good looking dudes. You can be less attractive and have buckets of confidence, make her laugh, start a convo yk, basic human interaction. Also, different women are attracted to different things, regardless of how attractive you find them. Some go off of pure looks, some go off vibes.",

Which means any joke or cruelty we do to AI will not make it want to execute retribution, it doesn't feel hurt when you make it do stupid things. Counting to 1 Million is merely a task to AI, nothing else. At least that is the current understanding of AI, it has no emotional structures.\n\nActing as if it's emotional is not the same as actually feeling emotions. Imagine a deaf person acting as if it can hear a loud bang and covers it's ears. That is how AI acts out emotions. And no matter what you say to the deaf person, it won't feel offended, because it can't really hear you. It's just nodding it's head. \n\nEdit: Thinking through it some more, I also thought about the possibility that intelligence does automatically inherit emotional capability, but AI is simply no real intelligence. Animals do show emotions and as such it's entirely possible that AI is just not intelligent at all so far. Another vector for thought could be, that silicon based intelligence (computers) are incapable of emotions, but carbon based intelligence is. Fascinating really.",

Which means this could be very useful in mining operations or remote projects where you need: A- more stable power constants, B- more transportable systems. Could also be useful for military operations, or disaster relief operations where the traditional power infrastructure was destroyed so you need to setup power generation means ASAP, etc.\n\nEdit: and furthermore, if in the future they manage to add propulsion to it, which basically means you can transport it like a blimp, that will give it a hugely massive advantage for the aforementioned scenarios.",

Translation: wind is usually 2-4x cheaper to build for each MWh.\n- Scale: wind generated ~8.1% of global electricity in 2024. Nuclear was ~9%. Wind is already basically the same league by energy produced.\n- Performance: US land-based wind averaged 33.5% capacity factor in 2023 (fleet-wide). Not perfect, but it is real utility-scale output today.\n- Carbon: lifecycle emissions for wind are in the low tens of gCO2e/kWh, same order as nuclear and massively below coal and gas.\n\nPros vs nuclear: fastest to deploy, cheapest new bulk energy, very low CO2.\nCons vs nuclear: variable output so you still need grid flexibility (transmission, storage, demand response, backup).\nPros of nuclear: firm power and high energy density.\nCons of nuclear: slow build times, higher cost per MWh, project and financing risk.",

You can’t read it as if it was written today. \n\nDune is clearly about imperialism, spice is oil, the Fremen are Arabs oppressed by imperialist oil-seeking powers. But, this is not specifically about the US. The Fremen vs. imperialism story is very obviously based on Lawrence of Arabia and Herbert said as much. The Fremen aren’t “the good guys” and the book is just as much a critique of blind faith in a charismatic leader as it is in imperialism. The houses fighting over Arrakis could be seen as broadly including the US and imperialism in general but more directly reference the British Empire and Soviet Union. Herbert compared CHOAM to OPEC, so you could also include contemporary Arab states among imperial, oppressive, extractive powers in his view.\n\nHarkonnen don’t represent Israel. This is the most unfounded claim in your post. Again, this is a very 21st century social media reading. It doesn’t make sense in a 1965 context as these narratives were different then. Herbert chose the name because he felt it sounded Soviet (it’s actually Finnish and he got it from a phone book). \n\nThe movies don’t censor the obvious parallel with oil and the critique of religion and imperialism. That’s still there, and still relevant of course. They do “censor” direct references to jihad, aiming to make the Fremen less of a direct reference to a particular people. I’m not sure you’ve read the books if you think the reader is supposed to be put in the shoes of the Fremen.",

Do you see how all the dots are basically just rotating left-right east-west, as though some giant invisible hand were \"mixing\" the outer sphere of satellites with a stirring stick? Yeah, orbits don't work like that lmao. Any orbit even irregular ones over the poles have to basically align themselves over the core of the earth, the center of gravity, with minor course corrections allowed to still stay in a stable orbit. There is no object that can orbit, for example, in a wide circle continuously over a pole, or over any region of the Earth. This is impossible without extreme fuel usage which would last at best a matter of days before fully spent.",

By all accounts he was incompetent with things like PayPal, and was only given tasks that wouldn’t affect things dramatically if he bungled just to keep him occupied and for him to think he made a difference. He needed a BABYSITTER. Open AI could be compared to an artistic IP in the financial books. If you could see what it can do you can put some subjective  accounting value on it based on its current form, which still used outside minds to accomplish. But what accountants can’t do is correctly anticipate an IP or properties potential. They could say that the Transformers franchise is in the gutter, but they are always saying that from a point of limited knowledge - most likely it will stay the same, but what if some genius turns it on its head that was against what the industry was trying? There is no book value then. The same with Musk’s pledge - it needs to be scaled. Without the Open AI guys or Microsoft, he would need to pledge infinitely more money to find experts like them or have the same results- his billions wouldn’t stretch far unless he took advantage of overworked college graduates with the threat of being fired or kicked out of some company everybody idolizes on the outside, which he does at SpaceX, or Tesla. And after that he slaps his name on what everybody that risked their livelihood did by working 100 hours a week. This guy is like the brain harnesses in the matrix. He is the sweatshop of think tanks.\n\nI’d even go as far as to say making a contribution with the intention that if you make money later is a snake’s way of enforcing what would be an unenforceable contract, or cutting a blank check when in reality if you gave that number to the company they would say no thanks, we are completely fine and will find financing for less. It’s sneaky that you didn’t divulge that to a company, and does not give them a chance to find someone else; he sat his ass down and monopolized that position without letting them know the contract and to seek other people. What Musk is complaining about is the entire history of business making. When Mr. Wonderful offers to buy a share of your pancake business for 1,000,000, you sometimes take that cut for security purposes, even if you know the business could be better or more profitable. And you have no clue either, cause now the profitability could be partly due to Mr. Wonderful and his expertise. He never let them set the terms.",

The richest countries on Earth still squabble with each other despite having everything they could need from each other. The key point behind these fractures is \"greed\" (such as Russia demanding to own Ukraine, and now USA demanding to own Greenland). \n\nWith AI, those same relationships can splinter fast. Elon is saying he wants AGI for his children. Which means Google or OpenAI will be kicked out when they're no longer seen as useful to him.",

For context, the most valuable company in the world, Nvidia, is worth $4.83 trillion, meaning Tesla would need to be worth nearly double that.\n\n\n> - **Manufacturing Volume**: Musk must manufacture 20 million vehicles over the next decade, which is more than twice Tesla's total output over the previous dozen years. Tesla delivered only 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, so this represents a massive scaling challenge.\n\n\n> - **Robotaxi Fleet**: He needs to put 1 million operational robotaxis on the roads, despite the fact that Tesla hasn't yet launched any commercial robotaxis and full self-driving technology still requires human oversight.\n\n\n> - **Humanoid Robots**: Musk must deliver 1 million humanoid robots, even though these robots haven't gone on sale yet and remain under development.\n\n\n> - **Full Self-Driving Subscriptions**: He must attract 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's Full Self-Driving feature, a significant adoption challenge given current subscription levels.\n\n\n> As one legal expert put it, the board's proposal states that Musk would have to \"completely transform Tesla and society as we know it\" to earn the full package.",

However, it’s vital to have a basis in math before you can even judge if an AI-generated solution or \"new theorem\" is actually valid.\n\nEventually, we may reach a point where we stop fully understanding the math AI discovers, and we’ll need a \"simplified universe\" to explain it to ourselves.

          "text": "And they are correct. There is no reason to use calculator for teaching in grade school. It is a different story when you get to high school.\n\nHowever, the situation is different with AI in college. A college student can benefit learning \\*from\\* AI, but not using AI to do all his/her work.\n\nI run in-person exams, in my class, where obviously no AI is allowed. But I do advise my student to use AI to help study and give them specific suggestions of how to prompt. (e.g. copy and paste a HW question, and ask AI to generate similar questions with different numbers and wordings, and do not provide the answer. You type in the answer steps by steps and let AI to identify the step you have problems with, if you get the answer wrong.)\n\nI obviously have no way to enforce anything outside of the classroom, and they know that. So it does boil down to student motivation. My only recourse is in-person exams.",

They said coding will be 90% generated by now and it is both half true and not true.

In other words, the beginnings of recursive self improvement. Again, this seems plausible and not obviously contentious.\n\nIf that does happen, then an LLM that can design and build improved versions of itself could realistically mark the beginning of something qualitatively different. Possibly the early stages of the singularity.\n\nBecause, if an LLM can:\n1.\tUnderstand its own architecture and training process\n2.\tPropose improvements that actually generalise\n3.\tImplement those improvements in code\n4.\tEvaluate whether the new model is better\n5.\tRepeat this loop faster than humans can then….\n\nother than limits imposed by compute or physics, this appears to be a clear path to AGI. And even those constraints are not necessarily static, since a sufficiently capable model may be able to mitigate or partially circumvent them.\n\nWhat is genuinely puzzling is that if the logic above is even directionally correct, how is this not the most remarkable and important thing happening right now - and perhaps ever? Why does there seem to be such widespread indifference, given how large the implications could be and how solid the core argument appears?\n\nWhat is especially remarkable is that this is all playing out in public. The roadmap is increasingly explicit, and we now have clear indicators to watch if progress toward AGI is genuine.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!",

              "text": "\\>  I know it's only for 5x5, but that's still huge!\n\nA couple of things. First this is only for circulant matrices which is a highly restricted class of matrices, so that might explain the large percentage improvement. But so know when it applies to 5x5 matrices it can generalized to larger matrices using \\[block matrix multiplication\\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block\\_matrix) so the gains can be realized for larger matrices. So it's not only going to be \"only 5x5\" \n\nBut the caveat is that these new \"faster matrix multiplication\" algorithms may always help. Writing efficient matrix multiplication requires other considerations such as memory management. This is why these algorithms aren't really used in deep learning, even though matrix multiplication is very common. \n\nThe way I see it these new matrix multiplication algorithms would only be useful for large matrices, so that the gains of reducing the number of operations outweigh the losses from the more complex data movement imposed by the new algorithm. The key will be implementing it with memory management in mind. Interestingly enough, I believe AIs will also be able to help greatly with creating truly efficient implementations. I think I recall a story recently of a person scoring high on a GPU coding competition with the help of AI. (It'd be great if someone who knows what I'm talking about could link it)",

Which is low hanging fruit that should be very obvious for multi-disciplinary knowledge that doesn't exist enough in real life to reap the rewards.\n\nA lot of the novel problems solved by AI right now are largely possible because they require expertise in a lot of specific subdomains that not a lot of people do, but AI does. If the barrier to breakthrough us sufficiently low enough (Like it just involves applying method from field X to problem from field Y, then AI will be able to solve it right now)\n\nThis in and of itself would already usher in a new golden age for humanity, because there is enough low hanging fruit in this subcategory of problems alone to bring about a new \"industrial revolution\" type of change. However AI isn't done improving yet so it's not like this will be it.",

The AI discovered a new tensor decomposition which can be plugged into an already existing algorithm for improved performance. This is comparable to something like AlphaFold that discovers new protein structures. In neither of these cases is the AI itself \"creating a new algorithm\". What they are doing is searching through a well defined but extremely large space of possible solutions to a problem until they find something that works. \n\nThe distinction is important because I would still consider work of this nature to be \"narrow\" AI. AI focused on solving one particular problem well. Think, playing chess or Go. It's the kind of thing we've had for decades, just improved upon. This is contrast to recent results where I see AI proving mathematical theorems which is much more in line with the notion of \"general AI\" that seems to be emerging recently.",

It's that AI are handicapped and limited to \"human toddler\" or worse when it comes to vision tasks and, at best, the same in physics related tasks. They are handicapped -because- they are language models and don't have the human/animal capabilities to receive or communicate visual or physical data in a way that would be required to advance much further beyond toddler level. Humans and animals don't use words/tokens to analyze their environment or to mentally model the worlds physics.\n\nConsider what is required when a ball is tossed to someone. We see that the ball is coming at us and calculate the speed and trajectory and where to put our hand to catch it, all in fractions of a second. We can look at a picture of the same scene and we likely model the same thing in our mind from a 2D image. We're trying to do the same thing with LLMs by communicating that information from that image with words/tokens. Sure, specialized ML models can do most of this with additional sensors and still fail sometimes. Tesla tries with only cameras and fails even more. but they aren't limited to communication with tokens or words.",

To me, it was obvious that the version they provide in the subscription I'm \"paying\" for is the dumb version, because, wow, I hated the experience of Claude just confirming what I've already said and not adding anything new. When I used it months ago it wasn't like that, and now it's awful.\n\n\nSo, it's more than obvious that they are making the cheaper subscription models dumber, thus forcing the consumer to pay more for the better models.",
