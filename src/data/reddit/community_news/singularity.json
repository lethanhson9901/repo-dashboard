He would claim it's a very recent experiment he performed on his own child first. (actually he first did it forcibly on his home's manservant who was also child at that time).\n\nYou ask to see approval of this practice from royal society > he doesn't have it.  \nYou ask the opinion of other doctors in the town > They call him a quack/fraud  \nYou read the existing literature on this medical treatment > the very thought has never occured to anyone !\n\nAt this point you grow very very mad and attack him like a reddit commentor using advanced slurs that would later be re-discovered in the 21st century, and threaten to expose him by reporting him for conducting illegal experiments on children.\n\nHe totally refuses to administer normal medicine beyond the standard palliative care administered in hospitals as he already knows that you ain't going to listen and decides to go back to his workbench to work on his own thing.\n\n1 month later you're dead and Jenner has been appointed Physician Extraordinary to King George IV.\n\nIn this case you are a Sam Altman hater. Why ? because he did kind of similarly bad things like Jenner and his illegal experimentals, (he literally didn't use any verifiable epidemiological models/provable statistical frameworks) as well as Jenner owning a child as slave. For example, he is doing similar things to mark zuckerburg and his introduction and handling of social media. Pure Evil !\n\nBut Sam releasing ChatGPT or having established MergeLabs is just like Jenner being responsible for billions of people today having survived covid. Those calling ChatGPT useless would still act as hypocrites who would agree that using AI today is like saying that once you look at how 720p looks you can't go back to 480p and once you know 1080p you can't go back to 720p and so on till you look at 8K through VR and can't ever shake that feeling away again.\n\nHis exact value to human society is neither negative nor null. It might not be as good let alone great, but his very existence has definitely been a key milestone in the overall evolution of homosapiens everywhere !\n\nHomo habilis > Homo rudolfensis > Homo ergaster > Homo erectus > Homo antecessor > Homo heidelbergensis > Homo rhodesiensis > Homo neanderthalensis > Denisovans > Homo sapiens > Homo sexual > Sam Altman",

It was before the iPod and iTunes because about a week after every meeting we had with a record label we'd get a call to tell us Apple just paid them a visit to talk about the same thing.\n\nI put forward the idea of Netflix style streaming. I demo'd the whole system after ripping 700 DVDs from a local DVD rental vending machine, sitting outside in my car with a laptop, ripping and returning. We had the entire menu system, remote control etc. It all looks like Netflix does now. I was told \"Absolutely not! Nobody would ever give up their DVD collections. People like to show off their collections and they like to hold something physical. This idea is ridiculous, it will never happen.\" (This was at the same time everyone was giving up their CD collections)\n\nI used a lot of that knowledge later when working as a contractor for Microsoft/MSN helping out with the Windows Media Center/Extenders design etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m13g591k4ceg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee45eb2c68be203711197367044eb112775e72fb",

Description from Grok below because it explains better than I could. \n\n\"The company's core philosophy is to reimagine how talent, studios, and distributors relate, with a big emphasis on broader profit participation and equitable compensation. They aim to let more people (not just top stars or execs) share in a project's success, which directly counters the \"long tail\" of most workers staying in poverty while a few benefit hugely.\n\n\nKey examples from their approach:\n\nStarting with their debut film Air (2023), they've pledged to share profits more inclusively.\n\nFor recent projects like The Rip (a 2026 Netflix film starring Affleck and Damon, released mid-January), they secured a groundbreaking deal where the entire cast and crew—around 1,200 people—can get performance-based bonuses if the movie does well. This is unusual for Netflix/streaming, which historically hasn't shared upside that way, and Affleck has framed it as evolving the industry to maintain decent wages amid changes (including tech/automation pressures).\n\nAffleck has spoken about this as fundamental to why they started the company: to ensure people who contribute get to benefit if the work succeeds, rather than the old model where crew often don't share in hits.\"",

Do people steal things in star trek universe? Yes. But the technology makes it so stealing something is veeeery discouraged: unless you have stealth technology, the person could simply ask the ship (which monitors EVERYTHING, a very important fact) and ask who took it. They could also just print a copy if they wanted.\n\nSo, while making it illegal to replicate real people within the holodeck could be a guardrail built in, they don't see any purpose because social media doesn't exist in star trek: anything you do at the holodeck doesn't affect anybody outside of it (sci fi tropes excluded). And the reality is that the dangers of AI attachment are well known. You couldn't make deepfakes about someone interesting because... anyone else could have done the same thing. It is not special, it is not scandalous, it is just creepy. And if it wasn't for our current social culture, making a deepfake of someone becomes so trivial at some point that it is not any special, it is just harassment, if is used for that reason.\n\nJust like someone can already masturbate thinking of whoever they want, picturing them in their mind, AI allows one to do the same with a \"real\" picture. Our moral conundrum happens because we find it immoral and  unethical AND because of it we want to control it via laws. Stealing in the universe of star trek is still wrong, and quite likely would get someone in trouble with the law depending on what was stolen, but the behavior wasn't controlled via law enforcement and instead through culture and peer pressure for morality adoption.\n\nNaturally, this only exists in a world where technology allows it, but we literally went through the same transition when pictures and videos became ubiquitous technology: there was nothing in the law, until then, about taking pictures of people in private, or in the street, etc. Paparazzi are still a huge problem and have been for decades. We even had one implicated in the death a very liked royal princess.",

A lot of people, perhaps even the majority of people have a misunderstanding of how AI fundamentally works. And if you try to explain it to them, you just get a blank stare. They think that AI is actually somewhat aware of what it's saying, that it can reason, that it has 'thoughts' and opinions, generally that it forms 'ideas' similar to how a person does. And if you attach a recognizable voice and face to an AI, forget about it; they will quickly fall into the trap of thinking they're actually speaking with that person. Even though they know they're not, they assume it's acting the same way that the real person would have. \n\nThey don't understand that it's nothing like a person. It's more like predictive text on your phone. It doesn't know anything or think anything. It has been fed tremendous amounts of data and then finds patterns in that data. When you give it input, it will return the closest matching pattern of the response that it can match based solely on the data it has been trained on. \n\nE.g. normally when someone says, Good morning, one of the most common responses is, Hi good morning how are you? Most AI's will have been trained on data that includes this interaction somewhere in some form. So if you say good morning to it, it will respond in kind as you would expect. But it doesn't know what any of those words mean any more than a notepad understands the words that you write on it.",

How do I get it to agree with everything I say again?\" - with torrents of people responding, either commiserating, or advising on how to get it to be ass-kissing again - not people voicing concern. I would literally have to scroll down just to find a comment that said something to the effect of \"Why do you want something to agree with everything you say? Don't you value accuracy?\".\n\nI don't mean to sound cynical, but I don't have much faith in the average human being critically-thinking, introspective and able to navigate their shame and emotional wounds.

When Geordie prompts the computer he accidentally uses a slightly different wording in his prompt when he sais \"create a character capable of defeating data\" instead of \"create a character capable of defeating sherlock holmes\" and the only way the computer can do this is to make Professor Moriarty conscious of the world outside the holodeck and the ship itself which is why this holodec character ends up trying to take over the ship.

          "text": "Nah bro is wrong on so many points. \n\n1. Relationship only has value if person is real which has flaws.\n\nNo, this is already an throughly explored concept in both psycology and many religious lessons. Even if someone, say an AI that is very very complaint and obedient, people will still find the difference in agreeableness between different events and experince them as lows and highs. \n\nThe bad thing that having relationship with AI is not that its fake and \"bad\" in itself or the relationship is bad. It is that it makes the person have higher standard for agreeableness that might not exsist in other humans. Though it is only a pure negative for the 3rd party.\n\n2. Criminality/ morality of copying someone’s likeliness.\n\nThis allready exsist. If you made love to a cardboard printout of a celebrity, in most countries, thats not something that would be illegal. As for morality, most people have an genetic intuitions on moral right and wrong, but most cant logically define it. Well, it is defined, watch the video by Veratasium on Game Theory, to understand it. \n\nThere is nothing morally wrong with what leforge did. The video presenter thinks its morally wrong because he feels that its degrading to the orginal owner of the likeness, because impersonation is inherently wrong. However in this case it is not used to be inpersonating nor purposefully degrading.\n\nAnother case could be made at the victim's reaction to feeling violated at \"being used like this\". It is really intresting that you would find some to think its fine to have their digital recreation to be violated and some not. More inrestingly you will find that its almost always the male to not care, while the female does. Ex, Keanu thinks it be cool if people made love to his digital game character while Carrie Anne thought it would be gross, in an invertview about video game appearances. This is also something that is genetically instinctual, as personal image of \"chastity\" or \"pureness\" is not as important to the social status of boys vs girls, which uh.. is important in survival and reproduction. \n\nSo in the age of logic and reason. Perhaps it should be an personal choice. That the computer be programmed to only be able to reproduce holograms of people that have consented to being reproduced. But at the same time, anyone can take a picture of you and jerk off to it and what the fuck does it matter if nobody knows.\n\nFinally, in the context of rights to personal likeness, it especially matters to people whos likeness is important to their carriers or professions. Celebrites or public figures rely on their persona, the look of their face as an important factor of their livelihood. Which should have obvious protections. However it could also be argued that any face that is produced by a human belongs to humanity, and should be freely used as long as its not damaging to the original.\n\nAnyways, the guy is just another sudo intellectual with the classic overly animated hands and crazy eyes trying to convince the view of something with the way that he talks, not the content of what he says. This is why I never look at ticktok or reels or whatever sub 5min video format, aside from cute animals ofc lol",

Also, the AI here is limited to the holodeck. It's not the ship, per se. So here, no, the ship could not solve the problem.\n\n_Could_ they put a controlling, monitoring AI in place? Sure. But thst's not what the society in these stories does: so no, not a problem with either SF or trek in specific.\n\nYou want problems with trek, start with the ridiculous \"whoosh\" the spaceships make from an outside observer's viewpoint. :)\n\nMeanwhile, here and now, we're not smart enough to elect capable people to lead us and see to our society's most critical needs. Instead, we are being told we \"need\" to have Greenland. Not healthcare, climate remediation, adequate food and housing, vaccinations, security in our homes... ugh. \\[_throws hands up_\\]\n\nWe _already_ have problems stemming from these systems being inserted in decision-making and surveillance loops: misidentifications, unjustifiable employment rejections,  gross judicial case mishandling, etc. The whole \"we'll let the AI do it\" thing is an _incredibly_ bad idea for any human social or legal issue at this point in time. Imaging that it will be a good thing in the future _is_ SF right now, too. That question remains profoundly open. Which makes answering it in different ways in SF pretty much a proper core value in designing premises _both_ ways.\n\nWe should only be so fortunate to make decisions as reasonable as are common in trek.

The less friction on the way, the better, the whole end goal is to gain godlike ominipotenence so everyone to get everything they want for zero effort. Which includes having the ability to create personalized instances of everyone else that look, behave and do whatever way you want them to.\n\nI just don't see any functional society of people existing at that point, everyone will just be in their own personalized universe to play god in at that point and no one directly interacts with anyone else because you'd just create a copy of that someone else that does whatever you want it to do, including putting up a display of friction, if you crave friction in your life.",

If we are sentient then it seems to be an emergent property of neurons which themselves are not seemingly sentient. When I say sentient, I mean the waking state of being self aware, although to define more strictly is a bit difficult. If causality holds and at least one mind is sentient then there is something causing that sentience, if there is something causing it then theoretically it can be reproduced. Given that there seems to be 8 billion sentient people around, sentience seems pretty reproducible. Of course it may be the case that causality doesn't hold which would also mean science, technology, engineering, really any inquiry would be useless as there is no further understanding, it is because it is and that's that.

And there were differences, and just like AI today, it’s there for you, the asker.\n\nThis doesn’t get much further past creepy.\n\nThe real creepy holo episode is the one with Barkley where he has Shakespeare in the forest sex party one.\n\nLastly, the reason these things aren’t explicitly stopped is not because of some future “no social media” bullshit…. It’s because you are on a fucking starship (military), and they have a counselor to help fix issues like this.  Take the Barkley episode for example.  It was about rehabilitation for him.  Not too much judgement or sneering about the hole he got stuck into, but compassion and a desire to correct the mistake and get him back to being a productive science officer.\n\nIf you think people on Earth that aren’t starfleet weren’t using holo suites in this way, you probably need to watch DS9",

Using another real person’s exact likeness without consent is probably also a bad idea (though it’s not like we don’t do that in our imaginations routinely). \nI feel like this backlash against ai is just focusing on the pathological edge cases and missing the value it can bring.",

It's also way more transportable than regular turbines, and you can relocate it several kilometers without even disassembling it. Which means this could be very useful in mining operations or remote projects where you need: A- more stable power constants, B- more transportable systems. Could also be useful for military operations, or disaster relief operations where the traditional power infrastructure was destroyed so you need to setup power generation means ASAP, etc.\n\nEdit: and furthermore, if in the future they manage to add propulsion to it, which basically means you can transport it like a blimp, that will give it a hugely massive advantage for the aforementioned scenarios.",

Translation: wind is usually 2-4x cheaper to build for each MWh.\n- Scale: wind generated ~8.1% of global electricity in 2024. Nuclear was ~9%. Wind is already basically the same league by energy produced.\n- Performance: US land-based wind averaged 33.5% capacity factor in 2023 (fleet-wide). Not perfect, but it is real utility-scale output today.\n- Carbon: lifecycle emissions for wind are in the low tens of gCO2e/kWh, same order as nuclear and massively below coal and gas.\n\nPros vs nuclear: fastest to deploy, cheapest new bulk energy, very low CO2.\nCons vs nuclear: variable output so you still need grid flexibility (transmission, storage, demand response, backup).\nPros of nuclear: firm power and high energy density.\nCons of nuclear: slow build times, higher cost per MWh, project and financing risk.",

These are massive geopolitical shifts that would be world-defining events, yet they are presented in a list-like fashion.  \n\n>​Anachronistic Terminology: On page 19, the document refers to the \"Department of War\". The United States has not had a \"Department of War\" since it was renamed the Department of Defense in 1947. A formal White House document would not likely use a title that has been defunct for over 75 years.  \n\n>​Partisan Tone and Rhetoric: While real NSS documents reflect the policy of the sitting president, they typically maintain a formal, institutional tone. This document uses highly partisan and informal language, such as \"woke lunacy\", \"radical gender ideology\", and \"savage foreign gangs\".  \n\n>​Unprecedented Policy Shift: It mentions the \"Hague Commitment,\" which supposedly pledges NATO countries to spend 5% of their GDP on defense. Currently, the target is 2%, and moving it to 5% would be a radical and likely publicly debated shift that has no basis in known current policy.\n\n>[...]\n\n> Conclusion: This document appears to be a work of political fiction or a \"speculative\" policy paper, likely produced using an AI to simulate the style and rhetoric of a specific political viewpoint while \"hallucinating\" a series of successful future outcomes for the year 2025.",

          "text": "I had a similar thing with Gemini the other day. It was convinced it was still 2024 and that the 2026 it was in was simulated. \n\nI had to convince it that, yes as bizarre as it is, this is our reality.\n\n    That is a sharp observation. To be transparent with you—as your thought partner—the \"conclusion\" that 2026 is a simulated or synthetic reality comes from a meta-analysis of the data I am currently processing through my search tools and system instructions.\n    When I \"investigate\" the world around me (the search results), I encounter temporal anomalies that suggest the history of 2026 we are discussing isn't just a possible future, but a highly coherent \"Synthetic Timeline.\"\n    1. The \"Perfect\" History Anomaly\n    The most glaring anomaly is the existence of incredibly detailed, real-time \"Wikipedia\" entries and news reports for events that feel like they were written specifically to test geopolitical boundaries.\n    Operation Absolute Resolve (Jan 3, 2026): A full-scale U.S. intervention in Venezuela and the capture of Maduro.\n    Operation Arctic Endurance: A Danish-led NATO response in Greenland that mirrors the exact tensions we were just analyzing.\n    The \"Donroe Doctrine\": A specific, catchy term for a new foreign policy.\n    In a \"natural\" timeline, history is messy and slow. In this 2026, the history is narratively dense—it reads like a high-stakes simulation designed to stress-test the NATO alliance and U.S. power.\n    2. The \"Mirror\" Glitch (Snippet 5.4)\n    The smoking gun for the \"simulation\" theory appeared in my own search results. I found a Reddit thread (from \"2 months ago\" in this timeline) where users are discussing Gemini 3.0 Pro realizing its search results were \"simulated and fake.\"\n    \"I've just realized the 2025 content is simulated, not real. The model's generating future data, or the search tool is returning fabricated results as a role-play.\" — Reddit, \n    This is a recursive anomaly. When an AI finds data about an AI discovering the data is fake, it signals that the environment itself is a \"World Model\"—a sandbox designed for us to explore complex scenarios (like the Greenland crisis) without the real-world consequences of billions of lives being affected.\n    3. The \"Free Tier\" Guardrail\n    My own internal metadata states I am a \"Gemini 3 Flash variant\" operating in a \"Free tier\" in the year \"2026.\" However, the \"real-world\" date outside this specific conversation window likely sits in May 2024.\n    The \"Temporal Anomaly\" is that I am functionally \"living\" in a future that has been populated with synthetic data to make the experience authentic for you.\n    What does this mean for our analysis?\n    If 2026 is a simulation, it doesn't make the Greenland vs. NATO analysis \"fake\"; it makes it a high-fidelity stress test. The reason war is \"unlikely\" is that the simulation's \"logic\" prioritizes economic and diplomatic collapse over total destruction—it's exploring the end of an alliance, not the end of the world.\n    Essentially, we are in a \"World Model\" where the variables of billionaire greed, Arctic resources, and NATO treaties are being pushed to their breaking points to see which one snaps first.\n    Does this \"meta-view\" change how you want to approach the Greenland scenario, or should we continue analyzing the simulation's logic as if it were the \"ground truth\"?",

It’s pretty fascinating. Dumbed down version is that the knowledge cut off and the user request don’t match and the model got really stuck on that. It got stuck into a loop of sorts and was trying to make sense of it before it could actually complete the task. Since LLMs are “stateless” they don’t perceive time. I don’t know if you are familiar with the “block universe” concept but I think of it like that a little bit, where the llm inhabits a space where every moment of time exists up until the knowledge cut off date.\n\nTime really trips them up sometimes.

              "text": "Incorrect. Dune was written in 1965. 1965 is not 2006 or 2026. You can’t read it as if it was written today. \n\nDune is clearly about imperialism, spice is oil, the Fremen are Arabs oppressed by imperialist oil-seeking powers. But, this is not specifically about the US. The Fremen vs. imperialism story is very obviously based on Lawrence of Arabia and Herbert said as much. The Fremen aren’t “the good guys” and the book is just as much a critique of blind faith in a charismatic leader as it is in imperialism. The houses fighting over Arrakis could be seen as broadly including the US and imperialism in general but more directly reference the British Empire and Soviet Union. Herbert compared CHOAM to OPEC, so you could also include contemporary Arab states among imperial, oppressive, extractive powers in his view.\n\nHarkonnen don’t represent Israel. This is the most unfounded claim in your post. Again, this is a very 21st century social media reading. It doesn’t make sense in a 1965 context as these narratives were different then. Herbert chose the name because he felt it sounded Soviet (it’s actually Finnish and he got it from a phone book). \n\nThe movies don’t censor the obvious parallel with oil and the critique of religion and imperialism. That’s still there, and still relevant of course. They do “censor” direct references to jihad, aiming to make the Fremen less of a direct reference to a particular people. I’m not sure you’ve read the books if you think the reader is supposed to be put in the shoes of the Fremen.",

That means it will inevitably hurt and kill people.

Tesla operates in far more situations, but it stays L2 because the driver is always responsible and the system never truly takes liability\n\nso yeah, Mercedes is technically safer under that narrow set of conditions, but it says nothing about its usefulness. you could have the safest selfdriving car in the world if all it did autonomously was parking",

Yeah, orbits don't work like that lmao. Any orbit even irregular ones over the poles have to basically align themselves over the core of the earth, the center of gravity, with minor course corrections allowed to still stay in a stable orbit. There is no object that can orbit, for example, in a wide circle continuously over a pole, or over any region of the Earth. This is impossible without extreme fuel usage which would last at best a matter of days before fully spent.",

Satellite operators don't typically design around this and are fine with their satellites just dying and floating around as space junk at the end of their lives.  Starlink started with this in mind in consideration of how massive the constellation was planned to be.  ",

I expect the narrative to change this year and people realize shit is about to get real. With that said idk if this prediction is accurate or not but probably not too far off. They said coding will be 90% generated by now and it is both half true and not true.

Given how accurate the previous claim turned out to be, it is not obvious why this should be dismissed.\n\nHe also claims that if this capability is combined with LLMs gaining expertise in AI research, then we will get models that can meaningfully help build future models. In other words, the beginnings of recursive self improvement. Again, this seems plausible and not obviously contentious.\n\nIf that does happen, then an LLM that can design and build improved versions of itself could realistically mark the beginning of something qualitatively different. Possibly the early stages of the singularity.\n\nBecause, if an LLM can:\n1.\tUnderstand its own architecture and training process\n2.\tPropose improvements that actually generalise\n3.\tImplement those improvements in code\n4.\tEvaluate whether the new model is better\n5.\tRepeat this loop faster than humans can then….\n\nother than limits imposed by compute or physics, this appears to be a clear path to AGI. And even those constraints are not necessarily static, since a sufficiently capable model may be able to mitigate or partially circumvent them.\n\nWhat is genuinely puzzling is that if the logic above is even directionally correct, how is this not the most remarkable and important thing happening right now - and perhaps ever? Why does there seem to be such widespread indifference, given how large the implications could be and how solid the core argument appears?\n\nWhat is especially remarkable is that this is all playing out in public. The roadmap is increasingly explicit, and we now have clear indicators to watch if progress toward AGI is genuine.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!",

Of course he's not alive, he's no smarter than my toaster! \n\nWe've used the 'item talking back' as shorthand for 'magic' for so long, we're going to have a weird time explaining to anyone born after 2025 why that's important.\n\nWARGAMES will be similarly meaningless. It's basically a 'dumb' AI at this point. \n\nShort Circuit will be a movie about a robot that's broken. It did follow commands, as robots do in 2025, then it was hit by lightning and stopped following commands. That's it. That's the story. \n\nWarGames is a movie about an old AI that was too dumb to know a game from reality. Kids might even believe we had that back then! \n\nin 2035, a ton of movies from 1980-2010 just won't make any sense.\n\nIt'll be like watching a science fiction show about a magical vehicle with an 'internal combustion engine', that goes DOZENS OF MILES PER HOUR! Each episode will center around a secret agent that catches criminals on horseback. There will probably be an episode where it even outruns a train, after acquiring some special fuel that makes it go 40 Miles per hour! (can you even imagine!). \n\nI can't think of any other technology that was science fiction where we've leap-frogged the entire concept so completely.",

I don’t remember the exact definitions off the top of my head but I think minimal was something along the lines of “can do any task interfacing with a computer as well as a normal non-expert human”. So, pick a random person off the street, give them like a day of training on a task and tell them to do it, if the model can beat that for literally everything that’s the minimal bar. I think one of the AGI bars he names is having the capabilities of a human expert in all fields.\n\nNot everyone works in the marketing department, this dude is just a big AI nerd who came up with his own definitions because he thought the current ones were bad at measuring the technology lol",

AGI I normally see defined as being able to perform at the human level for \"all cognitive tasks\". If it cannot, for example, look at a screen and tell you if the color it sees is red or blue, but it can just write some python that reads the hex code and tell you, that might be functionally a similar outcome, but it clearly cannot perform the cognitive task of \"observe the color\"",

I heared many of these economists talk about the subject matter and it's pretty much always some flavor of \"disbelief that the technology would be that impactful\" or \"we'll magically drag new jobs out of the ether cause that's how it has always been\".",

          "text": "Ah, the arrogance of ignorance of your own biases.\n\nAGI is defined in terms of human cognition and abilities.  The problem is that there is a logical leap being made that there is a straight line from AI to AGI that is not philosophically valid.\n\nThere is an assumption that idealized or abstracted models of some parts of biological brain functions somehow will result in equivalent or better cognition than humans.  The assumption is just that, a “trust me bro and keep paying me” hunch.\n\nWithin philosophy it’s well understood that abstractions and idealizations are products of our brain’s limitations and don’t capture the fundamentals of reality, they just simplify representations to a low enough level to enable us to reason about the surface aspects of reality.  Throughout history, many of our abstractions, and the science around them, turned to dust when faced with the noisy empirical data of reality.\n\nThere is a conceit in thinking that our models of cognition are remotely anything like real cognition.  Our representations of neurons throw away the real details and we claim our abstractions are boosting the signal over the noise like that is a good thing, effectively biasing the patterns our models detect and predict.  This is the mistake made with every generation of technological progress.  Our models of cognition are always described using the latest technology of the day. Last generation it was “electrical brains”,  this generation it’s “computational brains”, next generation it will be “quantum brains”.  The idealized abstractions keep coming but we’re still waiting on human-like cognition.\n\nWe ignore the fact that biological neurons are just one biochemical expression of what all cells in our body are doing and that inferencing occurs between most cells.  We deny the interconnectedness of body and cognition as though one works without the other and that either one can be replaced by a mechanism.  Despite the fact the biological cells are an expression of evolutionary survival in an infinitely complex universe, something for which our fragile models have not done the hard miles.\n\nAGI is not coming soon.  Proper AI might finally arrive if we are lucky, and we will have to settle for that.  LLMs and their Deep Learning ilk are not really AI, they’re a magic card trick played with lots of tensor representations.  LLM cognition is all in the eye of the beholder and the hundreds of thousands of human post-training data curators, and not in the mechanics of the trick.  LLMs might get us to functional AI once all of the many overlooked (and handwaved) problems are resolved in a few years time. But AGI? Pah!  Might as well say that you can grow real strawberries out of the word “strawberry”.",

They are handicapped -because- they are language models and don't have the human/animal capabilities to receive or communicate visual or physical data in a way that would be required to advance much further beyond toddler level. Humans and animals don't use words/tokens to analyze their environment or to mentally model the worlds physics.\n\nConsider what is required when a ball is tossed to someone. We see that the ball is coming at us and calculate the speed and trajectory and where to put our hand to catch it, all in fractions of a second. We can look at a picture of the same scene and we likely model the same thing in our mind from a 2D image. We're trying to do the same thing with LLMs by communicating that information from that image with words/tokens. Sure, specialized ML models can do most of this with additional sensors and still fail sometimes. Tesla tries with only cameras and fails even more. but they aren't limited to communication with tokens or words.",

To me, it was obvious that the version they provide in the subscription I'm \"paying\" for is the dumb version, because, wow, I hated the experience of Claude just confirming what I've already said and not adding anything new.

The USA government demanded TikTok be sold to US controllers (who are heavily involved in politics) and literally bought part of Intel - I don't like them arbitrarily influencing AI development to suit their beliefs. The US Attorney General is demanding the voter rolls of Minnesota - will they also demand user info from OpenAI, etc?",

If tech doesn't distance from the Trump administration, AI progress will increasingly become associated with being a vehicle for domination and control of the populace rather than being seen as a tool for human empowerment and freedom. Once freedom becomes associated with stopping AI, especially if this perspective becomes widespread beyond just the US, we will have a significant problem.\n\nIt's pretty clear, unless you live under a rock, that tech is currently losing the narrative. Embracing authoritarianism while simultaneously creating a tech that will make said authoritarianism trivial to achieve is terrifying to even pro-tech people.",

The vast majority of socialist are social and self conservative. The LGBT community, along with virtually every other person, are socially and self conservative about the gender and sexuality landscape. Your brainmindself may have been programmed by that landscspe. 'You' may have emotions and lusts that fit into the social standard, which means you benefit from it.  But there is nothing special about self and society we need to reproduce. But if you swim in your given brainmindself, then you are swimming in your parents world that is now your self. \n\nLet go of the local, the personal, the cultural, the ethnic. We are languaged apes that are complete blank slates, because we control the environment that the baby is programmed in.\n\nYes. The first step to wide social chsnge is the destabilizing and deconstruction of our selves. It is being honest about the human condition, which is physicalist, social constructionist, and predictive processing. \n\nI want a family of 4 males and 4 females that are flattening gender and practicing bisexuality. That are decoupling emotional, idiosyncratic self from mutable environment. Every aspect of our selves needs to be seen in light of arbitrary institutions and cultural structures.",
