Resveratrol was found to increase NAD+ levels.\n\nThe controversy isnt really about resveratrol, pterostilbene or other analogues, or even NAD+ precursors like NMN and NMR not working. \n\nThe general zeitgeist is that David Sinclair is a scammer because of the benefits that *should* result from NAD+ supplementation if the benefit he purports exists exists, and that the results have unfortunately been the opposite of what's claimed, with actual *harm* done from these supplements. \n\nThe reality is it it's option 3, he's not lying but NAD+ apparently has to be synthesized in the correct way inside the body for it to not be toxic. The current exogenous (outside the body) stimulation via supplementation still uses precursors which target the wrong receptors. Resveratrol, Petrostilbene, etc, they conceptually should work but in practice are harmful because of the way they are processed inside the body.\n\nSinclair's assertions were stretched massively and basically coopted by grifters.\n\nThat's what I found doing a lot of research into NAD+ anyways. I have a lot of medical issues and NAD+ came up everywhere so I did a deep dive into it.",

          "text": "**What Should We Do for Health and Longevity?**\n\nGiven that science suggests while NAD+ is excellent for youthfulness, synthetic supplements may be risky or ineffective, the primary strategy is to boost **endogenous** (natural) NAD+ production within the body.\n\nThe following practices achieve exactly what supplements are theoretically designed to do, but without any side effects:\n\n**1. Intermittent Fasting and Caloric Restriction**  \nControlled hunger (such as the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours) places a \"mild stress\" on the body. This naturally activates survival genes (sirtuins) and significantly elevates NAD+ levels.\n\n**2. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)**  \nExercises that spike your heart rate and leave you breathless (such as sprinting, fast cycling, or CrossFit) are the best stimulants for natural NAD+ production and mitochondrial biogenesis (the multiplication of the cells' energy-producing powerhouses).\n\n**3. Cold and Heat Exposure (Hormesis)**  \nUsing dry saunas (extreme heat) and ice baths or cold showers (extreme cold) provides \"beneficial shocks\" to the body. These triggers stimulate the natural production of heat shock proteins and increase NAD+ levels.\n\n**4. A Polyphenol-Rich Diet Instead of Supplements**  \nInstead of taking Resveratrol pills (which often contain doses thousands of times higher than natural levels and can be harmful), rely on natural sources. Consuming blueberries, red grapes, strawberries, dark chocolate (above 85%), and green tea introduces natural precursors into the body at the right pace and in a way that is compatible with the digestive system.\n\n**5. Regulating the Circadian Rhythm (Deep Sleep)**  \nThe enzyme in the body that produces NAD+ (NAMPT) is highly dependent on your circadian rhythm. If you stay up late or expose your eyes to phone light at night, the NAD+ production cycle is disrupted. Sleeping in total darkness, ideally between 10 PM and 6 AM, is vital for the production of this essential molecule.",

In adult human skin fibroblasts, 100 μM psilocin increased lifespan by 51%, with similar reductions in senescence and oxidative damage.\n\nIn vivo, aged female mice (19 months old, roughly equivalent to 60–65 human years) received monthly oral psilocybin doses (initial 5 mg/kg, then 15 mg/kg for 9 additional months). Over the 10-month treatment period, treated mice achieved an 80% survival rate versus 50% in vehicle controls, with fewer outward signs of decline (e.g., less fur graying and better coat quality). These effects suggest psilocybin acts as a potent geroprotective agent, influencing multiple hallmarks of aging beyond its known psychiatric benefits.\n\nThe authors emphasize these are early, preclinical findings (in vitro cells and mice only), warranting further research before any human longevity applications.\"\n\n[Kato, K., Kleinhenz, J.

Turns out, if you build your economy around resource extraction, even if you're making a killer profit, actual living conditions can go down. People don't need to be well educated to work in the mines. In fact, it's kinda better if they aren't, since then they don't get all weird about livable wages and human rights and stuff\n\nCountries invest in their middle class because, historically, it's been extremely profitable to do so (if you can't rely on other sources of income). Well educated people can work in factories and churn out goods. Or they can be like accountants or whatever, and pay a ton in income taxes\n\nSo, what happens when the middle class doesn't have anything to contribute? The 1% used to *need* the 99%, to do all their accounting work or whatever. But now the robots are doing all the accounting. So what do we need to keep all these poor people around for?

We don’t want AI to be the **average** human, we want it to be the Galois , the Einsteins, and the Terence Taos. Meaning for Terence Tao his training is 400-500(kcal)*365*10 which is around 2.12 MW. Total energy consumption for someone like Terence Tao. Now let’s find how much it took to train google deepthink to get gold at IMO last year. Rough estimates says around 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

A fairer comparison would be either the amount of energy needed to raise a human plus the energy used to answer one question vs the model training energy and single question answer energy OR just the energy a human needs to answer a question vs the energy the model needs to answer a question (where models are probably already more efficient).\n\nThis comparison has been made before by Dario and others.  They also liken evolution to pretraining in that they're both basically processes that establish a baseline level of performance (the first via natural selection and the second via whatever metrics are being optimized for in understanding natural language distribution).  Both also took a shitload of time and energy.  Intelligence isn't free.\n\nI genuinely don't know where people are getting the \"hE wAnTs To GeT rId Of HuMaNs\" nonsense from this.",

It helps get out pitchforks and upvotes but it's either disingenuous or just ignorant.\n\nHis point is a counterargument to a popular criticism of LLMs: the energy costs. People claiming the energy needs of training and running LLMs is too high are ignoring the insane amount of energy per productivity of humans. He's not reducing humans to productive slaves, he's comparing human LABOR to LLM LABOR. In order to get human labor you need at least all the things that existed and used energy in our society prior to LLMs. And if you consider all our entertainment, healthcare, and all other needs compared to our productivity, we're very inefficient as tools in comparison to LLMs. \n\nSo the popular argument that LLMs as a labor tool are less efficient than humans is flawed (or will be very soon). At some point (probably soon) human labor should be replaced; it would be environmentally irresponsible not to.\n\nI get that the real life implication is that human population will reduce drastically because less humans are needed to keep society functioning. But that's also better for the environment. The key to avoiding all the bad things that come with being obsolete isn't being willfully ignorant. Bad arguments aren't going to lend credibility to our cause. We should recognize what he's saying and pivot with the need to preserve the lives that exist and to help support those to come through this paradigm shift. \n\nIf humans are divorced from the way governments get their funding then we are no longer being represented. We need to focus our fear and frustration on changing the things we can impact while we can: ensuring a coupling between all humans and government. To do so, we need to ensure the profits from this technology go back to all humans so their votes still have buying power. Likely in the form of some combination of dividends and UBI for all humans. Ensure the populace is still pulling the strings, and not a bunch of billionaires waiting out (or deciding ways to accelerate) our extinction in their island bunkers. LLM development is good, so long as all of humanity (possibly all life in general) is the beneficiary. Then population sizes will self correct on their own in a manner we control rather than a sudden violent collapse.",

He's making a salient point that the belief that the current energy inputs required to train & produce a frontier AI model being abnormally high isn't actually the case when you compare it to the inputs that were required to produce the only other known high-level, adaptable intelligence system we have for comparison, the human brain. \n\nThat's a perfectly reasonable perspective to gauge the topic with, like if one was going to hypothesize about what the expected scale & energy requirements would be to produce an intelligent system, it makes complete sense to use the human brain as the standard for comparison.\n\nSam is not even the first person or only person in this space to look at AI model training from the perspective of human evolution/years of learning either. Dario literally made a similar point to this just last week on a podcast and Andrej Karpathy used a similar analogy a few months back too. This is why i'm pondering if this thread is being heavily botted or something because so many response seem completely delusional.",

Do you put it into a situation where it's a problem statement away from needing to derive it?",

When it says something has a 70% likelihood of happening, that type of prediction should come true about 70% of the time. While it still wouldn’t give us the true probability of any prior event, it would give us an educated guess about what things in history were uniquely unlikely and which were driven by predictable forces with a high degree of certainty.\n\nIf the singularity doesn’t make prediction useless by homogenizing all future outcomes such a model might be very valuable if used prospectively as well.\n",

Such a system trained just prior to relativity may be able to make the leap by extrapolating from the facts it has, but a system that actually can learn (and operate continuously) would be the real AGI holy grail.\n\nI really think that current AI is very good, we could be going over the singularity hump any day with it (it's pretty obvious AI companies have a feedback loop that is amplified by their own tools).

If you don‘t even try to find it, obviously you won‘t find it, but if you do, and you have enough time, you might discover it. Einstein might have done that x times faster, but I think Demis‘ stance is that human intelligence is mostly architectural, so in theory, any human could potentially arrive at the discovery of general relativity. Sure, sounds a bit far-fetched, but people have invented things like planes. Somebody 10,000 years ago would arguably not have been capable of that, no matter how intelligent, because it requires so many discoveries inbetween, which themselves require some trial and error to discover.

But when they’re training then on the benchmark, all you prove is that you’ve created something that’s good at solving that specific type of logic puzzle.\n\nSame as humans who study for the Mensa tests and learn all the common patterns and clues etc, you’re not actually becoming smarter, just better at taking the test.",

Now as I said in another comment, it's hard to get over 100~150 lines in a file for creative writing stuff. For coding projects, it can get it done, but I have to go through more iterations of fixing stuff it missed. Also running up against \"We're sorry but our servers are at max capacity, try again later.\" more often now.\n\nSo I'm inclined to believe it's an inference (running) issue than the model exactly...

Last year when we saw some of o3's solutions to ARC AGI 1, there was a lot of debate on what was the correct answer because there were different valid interpretations of the puzzle and some of o3's solutions were arguably better than the official solutions. \n\nBasically unless it's been *thoroughly* vetted, like math contests are by tens of thousands of people, most benchmarks will probably cap out somewhere above 90% but below 100%.

But they don't hate or care that my gf att was a cool black girl lol.  I would say we are not much smarter than birds and \n\n\nElon can be saved. Anyone wanting universal basic income for mankind can't be that bad. But good God does he need shroom slapped lol \n\n\nIdk maybe I did too many myself. Cuz I be seeing dying honey bees on the beach and sidewalk now.  There is this VA research facility in LA Jolla next to ucsd the biomedical college. And you can see birds and bees attempting to seek help. It's fucking wild. A bird with a broken wing trying to get into the er lobby of the VA hospital. Or bees all along the side walk. Like dehydrated ones. Because of how dry San Diego had been maybe? \n\n\nSo I carry around nerds to save them. They usually get super energetic and fly off. Once in Solana Beach station I helped one. And then later that night a bee zipped at me. So idk wtf lol. How sentient is nature?  Then when I was going around the long ass trail with long wild flower pappuses I'd make as many as possible go about. As to ensure more flowers for them. And then id notice like a honey bee following a woman onto a bus or something. \n\n\nI did psyops out of Che Café from 2019 to 2024 as covid had made the city awful to walk around in. Being followed by meth or fent zombies. Nah.  But it's mostly women at this college and at this punk rock club. So I'm rubbing flowers all over my self all the time because the last thing I want is to be the smelly dude lol.  So idk if bees knew me or something. But I got swarmed by them once. And it wasn't aggressive. They just swarmed me at Solana Beach station. And then idk why but I stepped away from it and filmed it. \n\n\nI lowkey wish I had stayed inside of the swarm of honey bees. \n\n\n\n\nSo lmao \n\n\nI think if we get Elon on some shrooms. He might use that money to save mankind.  Cuz if me broke as shit could have been able to change San Diego at all. With nothing but guerilla tactics. \n\n\nYeah idk. \n\n\nI have an interview for a barista at space x. Lmao so if I get in I'll see what I can do. But also army said maybe I could rejoin psyops. That means maybe can shroom trip trump at some point. Alzheimers needs to be prevented. If it makes people grounded better humans. So be it. \n\n\n I think we can help everyone to become balanced and better people. Too many hopping around on one left leg or one right leg. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Words can be anything, they mean nothing. \"I can shoot lightning bolts out of my ass.\" <- Does that make it true?\n\nFrom his actual actions, Musk has the terminal goals of a horny 13 year old male. He sees success in terms of the number of kids he manages to produce. That's the reason why he used IVF to ensure ***all*** 23 of his spawn were male: Males can have more kids than women. He wants to be the next Genghis Khan.\n\nIt's like scoring points in a basketball game to him. It's highly probable he'd like to turn this place into a breeding camp planet, like Epstein's fantasy for the tech singularity.\n\n[This here video essay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex6ozSj91SE) covers a bit of the Grimes saga, from what her point of view must have been. What really disturbs me is the likely possibility that she didn't want to have kids, but Musk pressured her into it. And thanks to having a bad boyfriend, her life's taken a pretty bad turn.\n\nThe first step to universal basic welfare is acknowledging that human beings deserve to live. At a minimum, that means universal healthcare, the real thing that the real countries all have. Musk has done everything in his power to do the exact opposite of that: Instead of giving everyone healthcare, he's scapegoating minority groups to distract everyone from taxing billionaires and giving everyone healthcare and a raise.\n\nHe's 'a real socialist' according to his own words... which translates to 'national socialist' to normal people whose assessment of reality isn't warped into a pretzel from being inside a death cult.\n\nLots of people have an edgy teenage phase, but most of us can manage to grow out of it by the age of.... 54.....\n\nIf he was capable of being a better person, he'd have become one long ago. Just expect more capital-grabbing, breed-maxing, and hope to not be turned into one of his literal broodmares I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream-style in the future.\n\nWheel keeps on turning.",

Chances are you've seen them do that if you browse this sub. However, you likely also know they go off the rails if you leave them to their devices.\n\nSo, rather than being a luddite who throws a tantrum when things don't work immediately, or a delusional fool burning millions of tokens and dollars hoping that the monkey in the typewriter produces what you want, you can be smart about it.\n\nAnd what does being smart about it means when it comes to OpenClaw? It means you have to be aware of the limits of tech, and that unless you want to waste a lot of time and money, you need to hold the agent's hand and impose restrictions on it's autonomy. Think of it like a new intern, they have a lot of brilliance and potential, but God knows they're dumb enough to make mistakes for your company.\n\nIn Sop's barbershop example, rather than simply firing the order and forgetting about it, have the agent report back to you on every step of the way. You can set OpenClaw to be able to communicate with you through Discord, Whatsapp, Telegram, and pretty much most other messaging apps, so make use of that. The agent has files on their workspace folder that it uses to both store information, and also act as a system prompt for it, simply add a rule somewhere appropriate that it should, for non scheduled tasks (scheduled as in, those ran via Cron), it should formulate a plan of action, and wait for the user's approval before starting with it.\n\nBack to the example. If you took more than 30 seconds to browse the built-in skills, you'd have noticed there's a Google Places one. Just feed it an API key, and give the agent a general idea of where you live, and it'll be able to browse that database for info.\n\nOr, you know, you can sidestep that whole thing by simply giving it the website/number you already know, and telling it that it needs to fill a form or text a number in order to get an appointment. There are dozens of ways to fulfill a task, that's why you,the human in charge, has to be the one to approve the best course of action.\n\nFrom there it's smooth sailing. The thing can browse the web and also text others if you set the appropriate configuration. If you somehow managed to get to the point of the image, then I'm afraid to tell you that you're suffering from a severe case of skill issue.",

It needs far more maintenance outside earth than a machine. A human needs constant gravity, food, warmth, air and water, not even mentioning the psychological aspect that would drive people mad in space and just stop functioning. Machines are much more flexible and the brain power part is getting worked on as we speak. It's just not a feasible scenario that human work will be more efficient than machines in space. The only reason would be to punish people for the fun of it. But usually economically factors weight in much higher than some sadistic drive to torture people. People exploit other humans for profit in 99% of the cases, not for pleasure.",

He tells them exactly why it will fail: wind shear, atmospheric density, the uneven burn rate of scavenged fuel. The probability of success is 0.0%.\n\nBut the tinkerer counters with a different statistic: the drones have adapted. They recently started scanning geothermal heat signatures and deep-ground acoustics. They tell the Professor that his hidden cave will be discovered by winter - a mathematical certainty of 100%!\n\nThe Professor laughs it off and tells them to get lost. Suicidal maniacs he calls them.\n\nThe Tinkerer is about to leave when he slides over a piece of tree bark with his \"calculations.\"\n\nThe Professor looks at the bark, his eye starts twitching. \"You didn't carry the one, you absolute savage,\" before angrily grabbing his charcoal. He starts running the calculations. The chance of success isn't 0.0% as he predicted. It's 0.1%. And the chance the drones find him by December is... 100%!\n\nThe Professor cynically sighs. \"Alright.\"\n\nWhen the time comes, the rocket takes three agonizing minutes to prime, forcing the rebels to defend the launchpad with nothing but sticks, stones and bows against two lethal scout drones armed with lasers and chainsaws. They manage to protect the rocket until it starts, but they get absolutely obliterated by the drones. Everyone is dead or dying.\n\nFrom this point onward we see everything from the pov of the tinkerer. He sat braced against a tree, bleeding out. He watches the fiery streak pierce the sky with his blurring vision.\n\nA brilliant, silent flash blooms against the stars, and instantly, the hum of the machines dies as the drones drop out of the air like heavy stones. The dying man weakly turns his head, watching the glowing LED eye of a fallen drone slowly flicker and dim into utter blackness, and a bloody, victorious smile cracks his face as he closes his eyes to the beautiful, absolute silence of a liberated world.\n\nOur eyes are closing. Fade to black.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n>!In the center of the screen a text appears.!<\n\n>!\\> BACKUP MOON DATACENTER CONNECTED.!<\n\n>!The DJI drone startup sound chimes.

The data centers will not be able to dissipate heat. It will work like a thermos. Space doesn’t work like most people think. Not only that but you’d need something like 35 ISS’s worth of solar panels/ infrastructure to put-up one data center. I Highly recommend watching the video Kyle Hill put out on YouTube. Data centers in space are a stupid pipe dream by conmen billionaires that don’t understand the physics. No serious person thinks it’s viable. Watch that video!",

In space radiation is the main/only driver of heat transfer. Radiation drives heat transfer to the 4th order of the temperature delta, so a large temperature delta is needed, but if it is large enough, it can transfer large amounts of heat. Now if the hot surface is about 100 C or 373 K and the cold side is 3 K pointing into deep space, we get about 1 KW/m2 of cooling, while not amazing, this is in the feasible range. If they can increase the surface temp to 300 C the performance jumps to 5.5 KW/m2. \n\nDatacenters in space are an engineering challenge, but not impossible like you described.",

Its not the 1920s anymore with factory workers - the human role was long ago replaced by specialized machines in most areas and the ones who are needed are paid 3rd world salaries to work like robots.\n\nThese spectacles have been pre-programmed routines - with absolutely jaw dropping AI algorithms to maintain balance and perform feats.   But... without human reasoning to go along with the human form factor - its just that pre-programmed moves or maybe a human in a VR suit,  its use is extremely niche.   Maybe a bomb disposal unit that requires walking up stairs,  it really doesnt do anything beyond performance work.\n\nBut... it by the time we have AGI and that takes over white collar jobs its just a matter of time before a newer version of robots with AGI takes over blue collar jobs.   Humanity is Fd.  Also we maybe \"fd\" well before then for the other obvious more practical use of these ;).",

And that was never the most efficient way to produce useful outputs: chase two things, and get crappy results on both instead of better results at one.\n\nA brain has regions that deal with specific data curves; your motor cortex doesn't know anything besides its cool movement macros that it does when commanded to. A brain is a system of many different modules that work in cooperation, competition, subordination, and blend together in spots.\n\nHere we are with language. 10x the RAM doesn't result in 10 times the quality, the closer you fit a curve the harder it is to fit it better, and the less that you get out of it. It's clear the surplus RAM is better used on other faculties that aren't saturated, things like vision-to-3d (also called 2d to 3d), 3d-to-2d, a motor cortex, etc.\n\nChat GPT was similar to a squirrel's brain trained on the intersection of grammar and human feedback scores shaping it into a chatbot. The upcoming datacenters will be around or larger than human scale, and could hypothetically physically fit neural networks comparable to our own. The hard part is figuring out an optimal partitioning in its abstraction, and the training methodology for vaguer things. Automated feedback from other AI would be necessary for midtask things like \"you are getting closer to the couch\", something that would be impractical to do with human feedback scores like Chat GPT used.\n\nTo bring up Mr.LeCun's comments on physical space, that's one of the easier domains.

Being able to issue commands to an AI in natural language was always thought to be one of the *harder* problems, much harder than being great at Go.\n\nTo be frank, if they *don't* have software for simulated space, they'd be very shitty AI Researchers. But they all do; NVidia has its Sim To Real software, [OpenAI has a simulation team](https://openai.com/careers/simulation-environments-engineer-san-francisco/), and so on.\n\nAs a casual observer who only sees news stories, you see all of these kinds of things as isolated things. An image generator. A video generator. Speech and music generators. Robots doing backflips. Chatbots. All of these faculties and more can be unified into a single system, given enough scale and proper reward functions.\n\nFrankly, the 'LLM plays Pokemon' thing was an extremely impressive moment.\n\nDumbos who don't know anything saw the things playing the games very poorly, very slowly, and laughed. Me, I'm very aware that the chatbots *were not trained to play turn based video games*. But given some scaffolding, they were able to do it. (Our own executive function modules have 'scaffolding' too, remember.)\n\nIt made me feel the same as when I saw [StackGAN images for the first time.](https://procedural-generation.tumblr.com/post/154474148263/stackgan-text-to-photo-realistic-image-synthesis) The vast majority of people didn't give a shit, just some flowers and birds right?\n\nBut it was like a miracle; going from having nothing of something, to having something of something. It was obvious image generation was going to get really good in around a decade.",

Your example “the Dr Pepper is in the fridge or it isn’t” has had technology around for years to evaluate conditions like that. But that’s a binary evaluation. AGI would need to actually process the environment and responding to general stimuli instead of prescribed conditions. That is very far off imo. \n\nI’m not an LLM or AI buff, but do work in automation. With equipment that boasts onboard “AI” as well as vision for things from QC inspections to robotic cells.",

We’ve also seen huge improvements in their memory and learning capabilities due to better external tool usage. There is still a lot of room for improvement on those dimensions, but if you look back at what things were like just 3 years ago, there has already been an insane amount of progress.\n\nModels are going to keep getting better. We will see improved ability to handle larger contexts with higher reliability and lower costs. Agents will be able to more effectively leverage a more sophisticated array of tools, and they will get a lot better at creating and optimizing custom subagents. There’s a ton of attention being given to continuous learning right now, and we’re going to see a lot of progress on that front in the year ahead. I expect we’ll see big improvements in how well the agentic coding platforms manage personal knowledge bases, and they’ll introduce automated example curation and prompt optimization for subagents and skills. \n\nIf so, we’ll soon have longer-running agents that use smarter, faster models with bigger context windows while leveraging self-optimized knowledge bases and skills/subagent networks that automatically improve based on experience. From where I stand, that looks like the road to AGI",

Eventually, the prisons filled up, and there were boatloads of prisoners (literally, they used old barges moored in the Thames as spillover prisons).\n\nThen the Government hit on the idea of securing their place in the Asia-Pacific by occupying the still-not-completely charted land mass of New Holland (Australia) with a penal colony. Getting shipped off to the other side of the world for stealing a jacket still wasn't deterring people from stealing jackets, but once you'd served your time, the New South Wales government (as the colony was initially called) would give you free (\"free\") land and you could make it rich as farmer in a colony desperate for food - or return to poverty as a former convict in England. \n\nThe Industrial Revolution lasted from 1750 to about 1900, 150 years.

Without a way to interact with real world it will be an advisor in the best case scenario and an evil hacker/propagandist in the worst case scenario.\nWhat do you expect the ai to do? To optimize production of goods? To make factories more efficient? Ok, how about the part where it implements zero corruption protocols so that nobody can make decisions that are suboptimal because they received a monetary reward? Will humans accept those protocols? Do you think that corrupted politicians will allow that to happen when it means that they will lose their profit? What if AI optimizes society by spreading wealth more evenly? Do you think the rich will simply part with their billions? Of course not. Under capitalism the ideas will be accepted only if they enhance the system we have now. Imagine having capitalism in HD in spades, everything that we have now but supercharged. The industrial revolution changed the economic model. To say that the impact will be 10 times greater would imply another such change which means moving from capitalism to something different, something super optimized and without corruption. The current system will resist.",

Everybody in the industry knows that, but remind people here of it and they down vote you to hell.\n\nIt is the dynamic of where we would like technology to be vs where it is. Take Kasparov predicting (imo accurately) that machines won't replace us in most things, because they are not like us.\n\nGuy was telling you the future and this sub dismissed his wisdom because he was wrong about chess in particular (chess is a low parameter system that is way too easy for AI, then you have high parameter systems like -you know- the economy which you'd need a computer the size of the solar system to train for and inference for).\n\nThere are practical limits on how we build our AIs and that may change in the future ofc, but until then people would use them for terrible advice on things they are not good at (say market investment, or novel research in open ended problems), and others will dismiss their advice on things they are good (low parameter environments like coding or brainstorming)...\n\nIn short all low hanging fruit would soon be plucked and if your job is there you would be disrupted. But tell this sub that this won't happen everywhere and they will disbelieve you.\n\nThey prefer to believe that technology is magic for some reason. Though I appreciate this subs willingness to pursuit useful technology. It is not magic but plucking low hanging fruit would indeed tighten the economy and increase productivtiy. A bit of how personal computer software did in the 1990s. Made working easier (but no did not displace most kinds of workers, only a few niche workers, same as what AI will do).",

Practically all benchmarks, even smaller private ones that test creativity and comprehension, are still slowly becoming saturated. Even if the larger jumps in improvement are in the narrower fields.\n\nA quote that paraphrased something Dario Amodei said in a recent interview: \"we still train our models on a wide range of data, because I think if you specialize in enough specialisms, you'll generalize to all specialisms\" with him saying he believes that we can get most of the way to AGI without continual learning. Which would be essentially thinking that there are only so many patterns to be deduced through human training data. And with enough learned patterns, you can develop a model that can become generally capable, whether it was trained on those areas or not.\n\nWhether you agree with that or not is irrelevant. There are different views that have reasoning that are just as valid as your own.",

Its been my experience that you can give a model a vague task such as \"complete this task\", but it'll do in a way that creates messy sprawling projects. It could be that getting something to work and getting it to work well/cohesively are the next things models should try to improve on rather than just task length, because as of right now, that's really what software engineering has become; staying on top of your model and making sure it adheres to an architecture, then iterating on it when it does something in a way you did not want it to do. \n\n  \nThose are my two cents in any case, I could very well be underestimating the progress just because my use case has remained the same.

So there's significant quality loss.\n\nFinally, it can't use very large models. Again due to the technology itself, it's locked into using the \"mini\" models like the 8B Llama one they have made so far.\n\nIt's not like it's *completely* useless. It's that the technology is best suited for internal data center high-volume, stable, single-model workloads.
