These are being developed heavily, and despite all the fuss, I don’t think that they are production-ready yet.\n\nKeep in mind, unlike traditional software, these are not meant to be deterministic, but just statistical. Responding in Russian to an English is very unlikely, but statistically speaking, that just means that it will wind up happening to someone in repeated interactions. Maybe it was you. I’d say, play around a bit more before you start setting up a new environment.",

      "text": "**Disclaimer:** I am not affiliated with Ollama in any way. This is purely based on my personal experience as a long-term user.\n\nI’ve been using Ollama since it first launched, and it has genuinely changed my workflow. Even with a powerful local machine, there are certain walls you eventually hit. Lately, I’ve been testing the $20/month Cloud plan, and I wanted to share why I think it’s worth every penny.\n\n**The \"Large Model\" Barrier**  \nWe are seeing incredible models being released, like **Kimi-k2.5**, DeepSeek, GLM, and various Open-Source versions of top-tier models. For 99% of us, running these locally is simply impossible unless you have a $30,000+ rig.\n\nYes, there is a free tier for Ollama Cloud, but we have to be realistic: running these massive models requires serious computation power. The paid plan gives you the stability and speed that a professional workflow requires.\n\n**Why I chose this over a ChatGPT/Claude subscription:**\n\n1. **The Ecosystem:** Instead of being locked into one model like GPT-5, I have immediate access to a variety of state-of-the-art models.\n2. **Simplicity:** If you have Ollama installed, you already know the drill. Switching to a cloud-hosted massive model is as simple as ollama run kimi-k2.5. No complex configurations, no manual weight management. It just works, and it’s incredibly fast.\n3. **ROI (Return on Investment):** If you are building something or doing serious work and don't have the budget for a custom local cluster, this $20 investment pays for itself almost immediately. It bridges the gap between \"hobbyist\" and \"enterprise-level\" capabilities.\n\n**The Only Downside**  \nIf I had to nitpick, it would be the transparency regarding limits. Much like the free plan, on the $20 plan, it’s sometimes hard to tell exactly when you’ll hit a rate limit. It’s a bit of a \"black box\" experience, but in my daily use, the performance has been worth the uncertainty.\n\n**My Suggestion:**  \nIf you are doing research or building tools and you need the power of models that your local VRAM can’t handle, stop hesitating. It’s a solid investment that democratizes access to high-end AI.\n\n**I’m curious to hear from others:**  \nIs anyone else here using the $20/month Ollama Cloud plan? What has your experience been like so far? Any \"pro-tips\" or secrets you’ve discovered to get the most out of it?\n\n",

I tink Claude gives a lot less compute but it supposedly has new updates in Claude Code that people are raving about. Kimu/Deepseek/Qwen etc are good but they're not state of the art like Claude and GPT still are.\n\nAnd if you want variety there's always Openrouter besides the free accounts that kimi, deepskeek, grok, claude, gpt and mistral hand out.",

              "text": "I appreciate your perspective, and I see where you’re coming from! However, I think there might be a misunderstanding of the current landscape of AI.\n\nFirst, regarding **SOTA (State of the Art)**: The idea that only OpenAI and Anthropic hold the crown is becoming outdated. If you look at recent benchmarks, models like **DeepSeek-V3** or **Qwen-2.5-Coder-32B/72B** are matching or even beating GPT and Claude in specific coding and logic tasks. For many of us, limiting our workflow to just two providers is actually a bottleneck, not a benefit.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned paying for 'free LLMs.' You aren't paying for the models themselves; you are paying for the **massive compute** required to run them at high speeds. Try running a 405B parameter model or the full Kimi-k2.5 locally even with a high-end consumer GPU, it's a struggle. The $20/month covers the infrastructure that allows you to swap between these giants instantly within the Ollama ecosystem.\n\nRegarding **OpenRouter**: It's a great service, no doubt. But for those of us who have built our entire workflow, scripts, and local integrations around the Ollama CLI and API, having a 'Cloud' version of that same experience is a game-changer. It’s about the seamless transition between local (small models) and cloud (massive models) without changing your codebase.\n\nIn my opinion, believing that only ChatGPT and Claude are worth using is a limitation. The open-weights world is moving faster than anyone expected, and having a professional environment to run them at scale is worth every cent. It’s not about 'free vs. paid' it's about **versatility and power.**\"",

If you get paid plans they last a lot more for webchat but once again Claude rate limits you sooner than all the others. \n\n\n\nThe real question is whether or not ollama is losing money to gain market share like all the commercial LLMs. I read somewhere that for every $1 openai brings in in revenue, they spend $7 in expenses. They're able to do that because of sky high company evaluations and investor funding. If ollama is just trying to break even or even make money on these models then it might not be worth the $20 investment,   \n  \nPerhaps the reason everything works on ollama cloud(assuming OP is not a shill poster as one person has noted, using an LLM to make his posts) is because of all the people who pay $20 a month, enough of them do not use ollama cloud as much as OP and are thus subsidizing him. So it's possible hat ollama could be overselling their cloud offering, relying on their paying customers to underutilize the service.",

So it's possible hat ollama could be overselling their cloud offering, relying on their paying customers to underutilize the service. \n\nThe other possibility is that ollama cloud is part of the \"ai bubble\" and some angel investors decided to take a match and burn money to keep the ollama project warm and their $20/mo is actually a tactic to build loyal customors. \n\nI just got a github copilot pro plan that gives me access to gpt5-2 codex, claude sonnet 4.5, opus 4.5, grok code fast 4.1 and other variants of openai and gemini. It costs $10 a month and it is obviously not raw API access but I get to work with those models. Microsoft is pobably losing money right now on it but they are building followers and slowly improving their infrastructure and probably working on secret llm models we do not know about. I think every LLM provider is burning money like crazy so possibly so is llama. \n\nAnyway the point is that the real question one needs to ask oneself is how much money is the LLM aggregator or creator is brining to market, Although I absolutely love the idea of ollama existing and making local LLMs available to experiment with, I don't think they're spending money like water so there may not be that much value in this $20 a month compared to $10 a month, $20 and $30 a month with others.",

      "text": "I have been using Ollama heavily for local development but the lack of state persistence is a major bottleneck. The moment you terminate the session, the context is lost. Standard RAG implementations are often inefficient wrappers that flood the context window with low-relevance tokens.\n\nI decided to solve this by engineering a dedicated memory server called Vestige.\n\nIt acts as a biological hippocampus for local agents. Instead of a flat vector search, I implemented the FSRS 6 algorithm directly in Rust to handle memory decay and reinforcement.\n\nHere is the architecture.\n\nThe system uses a directed graph where nodes represent memories and edges represent synaptic weights. When Llama 3 queries the system, it calculates a retrievability score based on the spacing effect. Information you access frequently is reinforced, while irrelevant data naturally decays over time. This mimics biological neuroplasticity and keeps the context window efficient.\n\nI initially prototyped this in Python but the serialization overhead during the graph traversal was unacceptable for real time chat. I rewrote the core logic in Rust using tokio and serde. The retrieval latency is now consistently under 8ms.\n\nI designed this to run as a Model Context Protocol server. It sits alongside Ollama and handles the long-term state management so your agent actually remembers project details across sessions.\n\nIf you are tired of your local models resetting every time you close the terminal, you can check the code here.\n\n[https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige](https://github.com/samvallad33/vestige)",

I have noticed a small spike in network usage (both for upload and download) while using the model, but I'm not sure if it is due to the usage of local ollama model, so I'm curious to know if it actually accesses the internet quietly. If so, how do I restrict it completely from accessing the internet? ",

The main keyword is \"function calling\", but others might use \"tool calling\", \"mcp support\" or other variations.\n\nThey won't be able to just use tools out of the box with ollama though, you will need to set up an \"adapter\" or something else in front of it that will let it know what tools are available and parse tool calls from its output - and actually do the thing.\n\nAlso different models are trained to call tools differently, you can tell it to call tools with whatever format by modifying the system prompt but it's much more likely to get it right if you use the format it was trained on. Qwen models for example are trained for Hermes-style function calling, which looks like `<tool_call>{\"name\": \"{tool_name}\", \"args\": {...}}</tool_call>`, so you need something that will parse those tool calls from their response and call the tool. Other models are trained with a different format, like `[tool_call] ... [/tool_call]`\n\nI tested a bunch of models on their tool calling ability and found Qwen3 to be the best and most consistent.\n\nFor ollama in specific, I've found this works in front of Ollama for hermes https://github.com/jonigl/ollama-mcp-bridge\n\nYou'll have to configure what tools/mcps it can call. For web searches in particular you can look for open source web search mcps to locally host, or use an online-hosted web search mcp (has better results, usually paid, but some have free tiers.).\n\nThere are web UIs you can host yourself that give you a dashboard to configure models and mcps and such, that might be your best bet if you are ok using their dashboards.",

      "text": "I run a QwQ 32B model variant in LM studio, and after the update today, I can finally use KV quantization without absolutely tanking my performance.  My question is, **if I'm running QwQ at four bit, will dropping my K/V cache to 4 bits notably impact the accuracy?**\n\nI'm happy at 4 bits for QwQ, I only have 24BG VRAM, and that fits nicely at around 19GB (I understand it's better to have more parameters than higher quants).  But I can only fit about 10k of context into the remaining 4GB of VRAM (need to leave about 1GB spare for system overheads), no where near enough for the conversational/role-play I use local LLMs for.  So I've bee running the KV cache in main memory with the CPU, easily runs up to 64k, but I never really go past 32k, because by then I'm around 1.5 tokens a second (compared to 15/s when there is negligible context).\n\nBut with KV cache at 4 bit I can hit 40k context without overloading my VRAM, and my tests so far indicate three times the token rate for a given context size compared to main memory/CPU.  But accuracy is more subjective, I'd love to hear your opinions or links to any studies.  My model is already running well at 4 bits, and it seems sensible to run the KV at the same accuracy as the model, anything more seems wasteful, unless there's something I'm not understanding...\n\nThanks in advance!",

When you are using qwen 32b QwQ or any reasoning model in 4bit  this destroys its reasoning capabilities and accuracy And hallucinations go way up. The smaller the model the greater the loss. \nIf you move down to something like nemotron 9b v2 in BF16(3090 works best with BF16) it will likely outperform the model you are using now on most all technical tasks. It boils down to math. Q4 is 2^4 = 16 whereas BF/F/FP16 is 2^16 = 65536.  This means each weight on your Q4 model can represent 16 numbers with precision gradation and BF16 will have 65536. This means the Q4 Qwen model you are using has lost 99.98 percent of its numerical precision. The amount of parameters the model has can overcome some of the 4bit precision loss but you need to be using something a lot larger than a 32b model to overcome this. Llama 405b in Q4 and Llama 70b in BF16 are very close in accuracy because the 405b model has so many parameters it can still generalize well enough\nIf what you are doing requires multi-step reasoning or accuracy use the higher precision and smaller model.",

Not to say I'd trust it for anything serious at 4 bits, my question is that if I'm already running at 4 bits, does quantizing the KV cache make anything worse?

The only downside is if I push beyond 40k tokens context, it spills over into main memory across the PCIE bus, and slows to a crawl.  But 18 tokens/second at 40k is so much better than <1, I never really used 64k because of the slow speed...  I can now talk to my AI for hours on end without it forgetting anything, and I never have to wait more than 30 seconds for the full response!  I said this was 3 time faster than it was to start with, but as context increases it gets up to 30 times faster...  That's insane!

The quantizing is about splitting tokens to use maybe and don’t.    So f your question is the same the quants will still result the same and thus yournkv quant is the same.   It happens on the in run so.      \n\nIf your quanting 22 it become 20  but so did 20-25   Like rounding down and up in essence. \n\nSo if all your tokens come in as q8. The second Q8!doesn’t change the first q8!  It just means that if you already know you already know.  \n\n\nUnless there’s three matches and it’s in opposite order the numbers the same so to speak.    It’s math stuff and makes no sense in one way and perfect sense in another so don’t worry too much just know that you need to not correct but give better first prompts.   Never correct. Just repromt better. \n\nThe way you solve it is first promot give the exhale and reasoning then second promo it can use first prompts Q8 to get question then it can use midel q8 to distill more tokens then q8 again.   This could mean you have two tokens that are close but neither is actually wrong just takes extra latented to run the logic chain and if token 1 fails it’ll backtrack usentoken 2 and if it gets stuck it hallucinates.   \n\nRestart the whole prompt chain clean with the solution to the bit it broke and you can stop getting the close nes because you already skipped that part nandahowed it part two. And thus you now have your own two equation logic chain solving the q8 confusion. \n\n\nDoesn’t work if you don’t know what you’re doing as a goal like a chat.  But true false it works.  This is agentic design not OpenAI throw it around 900 times to get the most manipulated response it could get\n\nThink of quanting as making the fist call make a variable you use and that variable doesn’t change.  It know that token matters and unless it’s choosing between two with the same number it’s going to did the right one. \n\nSome tokens don’t relate to billions of others and some do.  It depends on when where and how you ask   The pachinko machine has no channels is more like a golf course where you hit the edge of a bunker you end up in sand but the exact same thing with a extra token of wind makes it miss.    \n\nYou already had all the tokens for the world now you have the golf course in the cache but every swing your grabbing more tokens for the result from environmental impacts     Don’t take the second shot.  Take a mulligan and try better and then the wind is not a factor because you aim better and not even hit bunker in any situation.   That’s prompt engineering in a sports analogy",

          "text": "Q8 doesn’t matter.  Lower does.  \n\nThink like this.   If your midel is q8 you lose like 10-15% accuracy or resolution is better terminology.   \n\nIf the resolution is enough to get good hits then the reality is quanting those only matters if you are competeing.    \n\nSimple way to think analogy wise is.  \n\nI want 10 people.  Of those ten people I need a person that can do x.    I’m t can pick from 3.   Quanting makes that 3 become 1.5 so your getting the number 1 and the number two in theory.  That’s put in a bucket for repeat.   \n\nSame question same results you get from cache regardless. Temp zero and working token chain perfect worldnstuff .   Similar prompt the hits for those 3 might change but if those top 3!quanted differ they may still quant back to the same one if the number matches enough.  It’s just the weight value being quanted  which means that things get to red into ternery in a way.  -1 0. 1.    The way that splits up is more forced to 3 groups where in quanted the temp gets to play in the 0 quants more.  \n\n\n\nThe formula to ponder is.   If I have a token is it made ip of 1 or two or three tokens really.   They have three tokens go in but theirs three combine in latent to be 1 because quanted weight say that’s the word.   This is why rr a r are not related in think models so ts a two shot and re analisys of the token weight to get the right answer.  \n\nWhat’s actually happening is not one model of ta a chain of sub models hidden inside an api.  \n\nYou get one shot rewriting you prompt so it’s not misspelt is r has the right words first then it goes to a reasoner that thinks about what the question is and if it multi step.  Then it gets passed to thinking reasoners of whatever level THEY choose and you can for api stuff to try make it true but really that just asking the pre reasoners to loop and try and make more think options but it can just be. The same thing three times to get the same reasoner even though you ask for big reasoner.   \n\nThen they snide thenresoners they have their own graphs for their types so as you see in agent it sets up its own workspace and tools.   That’s you watching one of those calls live.   The others are just hidden.   \n\nReasoners are not the ones writing agent code the just have their own oversight of the model then it goes back to the in out reasoners to check for f it says bad words etc and fixies it or hard lines it as bad and back into the loop.  \n\n\nThis is why you get blank zips etc.  I’m t thinks it worked because the last response was zip created but like a Ralph loop is missing it needs the “ no you suck” to go reason.   \n\nNow if you are quanting everything you’re getting more consistent but only the core number one way.    \n\nYou see the same balance fallout issue with think tokens in thinkers.    Give it less tokens it never checks all the options only the first first or second  before time out.  If f youbhowever it be shot a list of options and then ask those options individually and then ask each one and then combine and ask one shot for advice it’s doing everything complete and quantising wouldn’t hurt.   \n\nQuantising a question make the question true or false like and that’s fine.  But if you’re exploring variations of the same  thing then quantizing makes things less able to walk to the sidewalk or side alley or different branch of thinking at all. \n\n\n\nSo quantising has nearly zero affect if your in true false concepts but if your looking for 3 variants that are close to each other.   Mcp Stdio template.  Vs mcp template as a question.  The first one is quantizenfrendly and the second will break regularly because mcp template was what 40+ different is code in out methods.  \n\n\nThe way around this issue is indexes and tokens if tokens but they don’t do that on APIs because it’s their model not yours.   Your fine tunes are just like OSS 20b translating before their own models.  It’s better than. I thing but it’s 30 mins of owning a midel you can actually train t so you never have to describe your codebase.  \n\nThis is why open source is more powerful than ChatGPT with rag and such.  \n\n\nYour real goal is to quant to 3 optiins -1 0 1 for each token then have that again be reworked ai it makes sense then distilled again until you get a formula really.  It’s a formula you can’t see but you can manipulate.  \n\nI would highly suggest you write prompts for local models to do the work then give the big models the work with the ability to iterate your stuff then bring back and do that loop because when you actually control the model even if it’s just fine tuning you save billions of tokens just trying to get the stages of models t understand your needs and doing it in code blocks is easier to it than words because code is structured and words mean nothing\n\n\nYou see this daily if vide coder because when you say move it copies.  If fmyou say relocate it moves and if you say copy it sometimes copies the file or sometimes writes a new file with its copied structure.  \n\n\nQuantizing move to only mean move and copy to mean copy in code works but in humans it’s not a clear line. \n\nSo. Think of quantises as formula and unquantised as discussion.   \n\nChat quantised models are hallucination machines and and code quantised models a it works or you need a better prompt for r example to force it to token your tokens.  \n\n\nIn use you get to overrule system prompts etc.   you do that well you can use qwen3 14b to code as well as kimi or Claude.    I’m t can’t think like it but it can match the same (2b tokens needed for almost every langue of code to English).  \n\nAfter those 2 b tokens the rest of the midel is just additional rules and logic and relations to make the responses match an input.   If you don’t need the figure stuff out to get the answer then you only need the tokens for the answer.    A = B false.  Thst not billions of dollars of development and tokens distilling training and whatever.    It just need to know that when it see A=B ? As those specific logic tokens to apply to a tool.  Do I g the work badly I. Retries and handing of and self checks and such is open ai and anthropic chasing dreams they already know is not doable with their binary systems but ts been know for like 8 years or f not longer but GPUs mean you don’t care about 500 fails if one win comes out fast enough.  \n\n\n\nIf f the solution takes longer than the tool then your farming money and lying to the world.\n\nOpen ai 🤖 a not making things fr humans it’s replacing them and all the tools they made and making it one universal translator.    We have calculators I don’t need a ai midel to do 1+1.  Ooenai is making a death machine anthrooic are making a universal tool use machine.  This is more of a hand holder and pusher.  \n\n\nOpenAI are so corrupted that they had to join the defence force and release a ooen weights model to stop copyrightable stuff hitting them.    I’m t hit anthropic and Suno and as you saw open ai want deepseek to nt copy their Open help the world” stuff.  \n\n\n\n\nShort answer.   Better questions examples a token guidance for quantised models but they are not broken they are more\nPowerful in ways",

Radio silence. No acknowledgment, no \"we're looking into it\",\n\nnothing.\n\n\n\n\\## Questions for the Community\n\n\n\n1. Is anyone else experiencing similar issues with deepseek models on Ollama Cloud?\n\n2. Is this level of unreliability normal?\n\n3. Has anyone actually gotten a response from Ollama support (hello@ollama.com)?\n\n4. Are there alternative providers for deepseek-v3 that are more reliable?\n\n\n\n\\## What I'm Asking Ollama\n\n\n\n1. Investigate why your servers are returning 3,500+ 429 errors in a single session\n\n2. Investigate the 500 errors that crash the service after \\~30 requests\n\n3. Respond to support tickets\n\n4. Credit for the failed requests that were still billed\n\n\n\nI have complete logs documenting every single error with timestamps. Happy to\n\nshare with Ollama support if they ever decide to respond.\n\n\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Edit:\\*\\* I'll update this post if/when I get a response.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Edit 2:\\*\\* For those asking, my use case is legitimate content moderation for a\n\nFrench platform. \\~200-300 requests per day, nothing excessive.\n\n",

This is very unacceptable and I take full accountability for your experience. \n\n  \nI am looking into what could be the cause of this, and why rate limits are being hit to cause the errors. In the meantime, I have gone ahead and refunded 3 months of payment. I get it, it does not mean much if you are not receiving the service you've paid for.  \n\n  \n[michael@ollama.com](mailto:michael@ollama.com)",
