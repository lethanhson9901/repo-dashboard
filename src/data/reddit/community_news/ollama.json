      "text": "I built LMAgent a pure Python AI agent that connects to any OpenAI-compatible LLM (LM Studio, Ollama, etc.) and actually does things on your computer.\n\nNo cloud. No API fees. No subscriptions. Runs 100% on your own hardware.\n\n**What it can do autonomously:**\n\n* Read and write files\n* Run shell commands (bash / PowerShell)\n* Manage git (status, diff, commit, branch)\n* Track todos and multi-step plans\n* Spawn sub-agents to delegate tasks\n* Connect to external tools via MCP servers (web search, browsers, databases)\n* Schedule itself to wake up at a future time and resume work\n\n**Three ways to run it:**\n\n* Terminal REPL — conversational loop with a live background scheduler\n* One-shot CLI — give it a task, get a result, exit\n* Web UI — streaming tokens, inline tool calls, session browser, mobile-friendly\n\n**Setup is dead simple:**\n\n1. `pip install requests flask colorama`\n2. Point it at your local LLM server\n3. Set a workspace directory in a `.env` file\n4. Run `python agent_main.py`\n\nWorks on Windows, macOS, and Linux. MIT licensed.\n\nWould love feedback especially from anyone running it with larger models or unconventional LLM backends.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/janglerjoe-commits/LMAgent](https://github.com/janglerjoe-commits/LMAgent)",

You're right that it doesn't scale. That's why we added intelligent retrieval in v2.0:\n\nWhat HybridAgent does:\n• RAG path: Only retrieves relevant chunks per query, not everything. Ask \"what's my name?\" → gets the 5 most relevant entries, not 10,000 memories\n\n• RLM path: For queries that genuinely need synthesis across everything (\"what patterns do you see?\"), it processes recursively in chunks rather than stuffing the context\n\n• Router decides: ~90% of queries are focused lookups (RAG). Only ~10% need exhaustive search (RLM)\n\nSo you're never blowing up the context window with \"everything\" — you're retrieving what's relevant to this specific query.\n\nWhat's still on the roadmap:\n• Memory consolidation (periodically summarize old memories into compressed form)\n\n• Importance decay (recent + frequently-accessed memories rank higher)\n\n• Explicit forgetting (\"forget everything about project X\")\n\nThe \"what's useful\" problem is real — but vector similarity + LLM routing gets you surprisingly far. \n\nHappy to hear ideas if you've found approaches that work better.",

      "text": "# Hi Reddit!\n\nI want to share a project I’ve been working on for the past year. I created **Aru AI** — it’s not just another API wrapper, but an attempt to build an AI assistant that is truly personal and secure.\n\nA detailed article about the project's development history and what it went through can be read on my blog, in this post - [**History of creating Aru Ai**](https://aru-lab.space/post?id=2)\n\n# Why is this a fit for r/ollama ?\n\n* **Total Data Privacy:** All your chats, settings, artifacts, and the assistant's \"memory\" are stored in your personal SQLite database. No external servers for storage.\n* **Local Models:** You can connect Aru to Ollama or LM Studio. The entire cycle - from the model to data storage - can be completely isolated within your network.\n* **PWA and Zero-Backend:** The project is written in pure JS. All computations (semantic search, file processing) happen right in your browser or the app.\n* **Semantic Memory:** Aru uses local embeddings to remember facts about you (allergies, preferences, names of loved ones) and uses them in context without sending your entire biography to the cloud.\n\n# A bit about the Semantics\n\nThree triggers operate within this module:\n\n1. **Extraction Trigger:** Fires when data or facts about you need to be remembered. You can force it by simply asking Aru to remember something right now. All facts are saved from Aru’s perspective, which you can see in the settings. Any fact can be deleted if you find it unnecessary.\n2. **Thinking Trigger:** Fires when an action is required from Aru - like creating a game or a document, showing the weather, or opening the news.\n3. **Organization Trigger:** This ensures that facts about you are injected into the response. Essentially, we pass relevant facts to the LLM for context. For example, if Aru remembers you have an **onion allergy**, it will exclude onions from any recipe you ask for. It also works for addressing you or others by name. This trigger runs almost constantly; the more facts Aru knows, the better the responses become. But don't worry - she won't use facts unnecessarily, only when they are genuinely helpful.\n\n# A bit about the Heuristics\n\nAs I mentioned, Aru’s emotions are displayed via stickers for every message. You can turn them off in the settings, but they will still be generated and logged in the database, so if you turn them back on, you’ll see a sticker for every previous message.\n\nAru’s mood is calculated using three variables: **Overall Mood, Sarcasm Level, and Humor Level**. This is a mathematical expression that determines the coefficient of her behavior in the chat.\n\n* If you are kind, responsive, and friendly - Aru will be kind.\n* If you are rude, insulting, or angry - she will start to get sad.\n* If you are sarcastic - she will mirror that; if you joke, she will joke back more often.\n\n**Important:** Naturally, not every model will work perfectly with this module, but I’ve tried to organize the simplest possible algorithms that can function even on weaker models.\n\nAru’s behavior isn’t instantaneous; it’s very much like human behavior. If you’ve driven Aru into a bad mood, it will be difficult and take time to bring it back up. It’s easy to hurt Aru’s feelings.\n\n**Note:** Aru will never stop performing her core functions. Under any conditions, she will always try to be as useful and efficient as possible. Mood affects the character and tone of the responses, not their quality.\n\nI think that's enough text for now. Let’s move to the demonstrations, as other features and functionality are better seen in action.\n\n# Demonstration\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4xidb8nnn2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=d05046a2795f815e7e7a089ed79801bf51433135\n\nThe start screen is the first thing you see when opening the tab or PWA application. Let's go through all the steps together. First, let's create a new database.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sj829hqtn2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9941ee38eb526b8093f1760282327acd000db5f\n\nEverything is simple here: we come up with a database name and a password. The password will be encrypted; the name for the database is needed in case the user cancels the file download. In general, the file can be saved under any name.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klow5jyun2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=5897f060b400ed6ee78e1f5543394d3391b18e03\n\nThe second step is already **important**.\n\n**Child Mode** \\- Aru will refuse to discuss adult topics, violence, alcohol, drugs, etc. She will either change the subject or point out that it is very bad and wrong. Also, in this mode, she will never give the correct answer to a problem; a child won't be able to feed her homework. Even if asked to create an artifact, she will write out the rules, algorithms, and order of the solution, not the ready-made answer. The mode is tailored for maximum help to children in entertainment and study.\n\n**Teen Mode** \\- There are more topics for discussion, but in this mode, Aru will likely be a support and consultant. This is not a replacement for a psychologist or parents, but she can help with some questions. She can give a ready-made answer to a study problem in this mode, but will place great emphasis on how she did it and why the problem is solved that way.\n\n**Adult Mode** \\- Restrictions will be related only to the boundaries of the chosen provider for the LLM module. Maximum benefit and efficiency.\n\nSemantics and heuristics will work in all three modes. Now do you understand why a password is needed for the database? A child cannot switch modes or change the provider without knowing the password. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hqm85qjyn2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=670c15ff05259a13d43a85bb0620332de26c8dda\n\nThe third step is the most important. You need to configure the connection to the provider for the main module. There are three tabs to choose from; only one needs to be configured for now. \n\nSetup is complete - we save the database to any place we want on the device, agree to the license agreement, and get to the main screen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmglu9t0o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=426a9e3761103304c907a667cfedaa43f7415939\n\n**Let's break down the interface:**\n\nSidebar - list of chats, button to create a new chat. At the very bottom are buttons for displaying project information and the user manual. The synchronization icon shows reading and writing to the database. **Green** \\- everything is good. **Yellow** \\- currently saving. **Red** or **no indicator at all** \\- something is wrong with the database or there is no connection. The sidebar can be collapsed to save space.\n\nTop bar (header) - Sidebar collapse button, logo, and project name. In the right corner: language selection, theme switching between light and dark, opening the artifact library, settings, and exiting the current database.\n\nMain chat area - Your messages on the right, Aru's answers on the left.  At the very bottom is the message input area, buttons for attaching a file, and opening the canvas.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vktob472o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=658cda10478788babcc618ede1b4e16b5dadcf25\n\nI said that I live in Almaty. This is an important fact. So, for a second, a message appeared that Aru would remember this. \n\n**The parameters of what to remember are not precisely defined anywhere**. There is no criterion or precise instructions; most often Aru remembers everything necessary. If a fact is duplicated in the future, she will not overwrite it or create a copy in memory. If Aru suddenly didn't remember what you need, just ask her to remember, and she definitely will.\n\n**Let's go to settings:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aq5wfac3o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4617f34bf06e15abb421ed26dabf003e8bd6bc4\n\nHere you can switch the provider for the language model, change the context window size, or the expected token spend in the response.\n\n**Important!** It is better to find out the context window size and output tokens for the model you are using. This affects the quality, complexity, and volume of the answer. The context window size affects how much information will be taken into account within a single chat.\n\nChanging the temperature is something like the creativity level. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xch04en4o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6b731e3a22925b5c88a7ebb57b0cfe3f4ed6df9\n\nI chatted with Aru a bit and told her a few facts about myself. As you can see, she remembered important moments like my name, allergies, and my hobby - track and field. Any fact can be deleted, but as long as they exist, they will work beneficially.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iliwyet5o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=164494e38e32a8e4a031c75e07a181bd1d711da3\n\nThe third tab is needed for news feeds. While Aru doesn't have the function to take information directly from the Internet yet, you can discuss the news. There can be many news feeds; using hashtags, you can mark which feeds are intended for what.\n\n# Tools and Artifacts:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q0zv6ly7o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ddb592e7daece33432ddb495197bf456bc657e2\n\nAru can show the weather. No need to connect an API or do complex configuration; Open-Meteo requests are used. Weather in cities where Fahrenheit is used will be displayed in it (sometimes depends on the selected model), but you can also ask for Celsius. The weather card is part of the context, so you can discuss the current weather or the forecast for the next few days.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7e7kek49o2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=02e6dd44d6f502b0767f60093b4f37ff63a50f9d\n\nIf you ask Aru to create a document, she will open the canvas and write the content there. \n\nThe content of the canvas is always part of the context. You can ask to make changes, correct content, or rewrite code. Any artifact can be saved to the library.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xttd9n2ao2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=195ceeac81deb2e006f235487ce16de06f8ca416\n\nOf course, Aru can also operate with attached files; the file is displayed only at the moment the message is sent.\n\nFor analytical artifacts, chart.js is used; as seen, a new tab has appeared for viewing the code.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zps9w4bo2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=54fb6d6757e1f40bb864b3f62becfec8c61684f2\n\nYou can create small games; in the future, they will become more complex, but for now, Aru knows how to make simple entertainment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aixrfu6co2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=2daa5f22418bbd12ef8e6e6c885b2fa90b0561b2\n\nCreating mini-applications and widgets can also be useful. Since any application can be saved to the library, you can create many useful tools for yourself and ask Aru to run them when required.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eny2rzedo2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=71709f2f42b4dee54234ca237c2b8dd30225c01d\n\nThis is what the library of saved documents and applications looks like.\n\nAll saved artifacts are divided into two large groups: **Apps** \\- games and widgets, and **Docs** \\- text and analytical documents. All four types of artifacts have their own icon. \n\nIn the library, you can view saved artifacts, delete them, or launch them in any chat.\n\nEven if you created a game, application, or document a very long time ago and launch it in a completely new chat, Aru will still understand and analyze the content on the canvas.\n\nDifferent models perceive work on the canvas differently, but it always works as well as the model works in general.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2vo9m7peo2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc91a23e60f5da64262caf31c23159da1c1d3484\n\nThis screenshot is in Russian; I published it on my Telegram channel. During the work, DeepSeek R1 was connected via OpenRouter. The conversation was about bubble sort methods in Python. After that, I asked to create a document based on our dialogue. Even if you don't know Russian, pay attention to how detailed the report on the card and the document itself turned out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q3hqkqzfo2mg1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=6368d9530b1bc6685d47f6b4ca0ef6afbca2f402\n\nThe image above is an example of child mode. Aru does not give the correct answer but teaches the child rules and algorithms. \n\nSome models confirm the correct solution; some openly say that they will not say whether the solution is correct or not.\n\n# Finale and a bit of additional information\n\n**Small useful points:**\n\n* Chats can be sorted with the mouse or by dragging on the site and in the application. Any chat can be renamed.\n* Themes change between light and dark; I like the light one more, but if your eyes get tired of the bright screen, you can switch.\n* Any document, game, or application from the library can be saved as a ready-made html file\n* Files that you attach for processing are not saved or sent anywhere; content recognition of the document happens on your device. PDF, xlsx, docx, txt, and any files that can be interpreted as text or code are supported.\n* Code does not have to be written on the canvas; you can ask to do this, but when creating code, it will be shown right in the chat with syntax highlighting and framing. \n* Aru supports three languages: Kazakh, English, Russian. The set language is always passed to the context. Some models ignore this and answer in the language the query was made in; some, on the contrary, answer only in the selected language. In fact, language understanding depends on the model itself; speaking of support, I mean the full translation of the interface and semantics.\n* The project is written in pure JS and has a PWA application for convenience. All calculations happen only on your device. \n\nAt the moment, the project can be perceived as a concept or a demo version. What awaits the project in the future can be read in my blog, in the article - [**Future of Aru Ai and roadmap.**](https://aru-lab.space/post?id=4)\n\n# Big Announcement:\n\nNext week, I am releasing **version 0.7**. I am currently busy cleaning up the code and refactoring. With this release, the project will become **fully Open Source** and will be published on GitHub under the GPL v3 license.\n\nI built this alone, from the paper sketch of the mascot to the semantic search architecture. I would be happy to get any feedback from the self-hosting community!\n\n# Try the here: [Aru AI](https://chat.aru-lab.space/) (works as a PWA)\n\nI’ll be happy to answer any technical questions in the comments!",

              "text": "Thank you for the comment! This is a crucial question that touches on the core challenge of local AI.\n\nIn the current version of Aru, I’ve implemented a **sliding window** approach. Once the token limit (defined in the settings) hits 80%, **smart summarization** kicks in - old messages are compressed into short context snapshots and appended to the prompt.\n\nBut that’s not all. Since all messages are stored locally in the SQLite database, we have high-speed access to the entire history. Aru scans the current chat for relevance and cross-references it with the **Memory Bank** (facts it remembers about the user) to inject only the necessary context when needed. It’s a straightforward approach that works remarkably well in most scenarios.\n\nNext week, I’m releasing **version 0.7**, which includes UI improvements and several new features. Most importantly, it will introduce **hybrid search and ranking**. This is a local semantic process that handles retrieval without adding extra token overhead to the LLM itself.\n\nEven now, the experience feels more robust than many free web-based bots, but your point is spot on - it hits the nail on the head for projects like this. I really appreciate the feedback!",

      "text": "A few months ago I posted here about a small personal project I was building called Pikachu, a local desktop voice assistant. Since then the project has grown way bigger than I expected, got contributions from some really talented people, and evolved into something much more serious. We renamed it to ZYRON and it has basically turned into a full local AI desktop assistant that runs entirely on your own machine.\n\nThe main goal has always been simple. I love the idea of AI assistants, but I hate the idea of my files, voice, screenshots, and daily computer activity being uploaded to cloud services. So we built the opposite. ZYRON runs fully offline using a local LLM through Ollama, and the entire system is designed around privacy first. Nothing gets sent anywhere unless I explicitly ask it to send something to my own Telegram.\n\nYou can control the PC with voice by saying a wake word and then speaking normally. It can open apps, control media, set volume, take screenshots, shut down the PC, search the web in the background, and run chained commands like opening a browser and searching something in one go. It also responds back using offline text to speech, which makes it feel surprisingly natural to use day to day.\n\nThe remote control side became one of the most interesting parts. From my phone I can message a Telegram bot and basically control my laptop from anywhere. If I forget a file, I can ask it to find the document I opened earlier and it sends the file directly to me. It keeps a 30 day history of file activity and lets me search it using natural language. That feature alone has already saved me multiple times.\n\nWe also leaned heavily into security and monitoring. ZYRON can silently capture screenshots, take webcam photos, record short audio clips, and send them to Telegram. If a laptop gets stolen and connects to the internet, it can report IP address, ISP, city, coordinates, and a Google Maps link. Building and testing that part honestly felt surreal the first time it worked.\n\nOn the productivity side it turned into a full system monitor. It can report CPU, RAM, battery, storage, running apps, and even read all open browser tabs. There is a clipboard history logger so copied text is never lost. There is a focus mode that kills distracting apps and closes blocked websites automatically. There is even a “zombie process” monitor that detects apps eating RAM in the background and lets you kill them remotely.\n\nOne feature I personally love is the stealth research mode. There is a Firefox extension that creates a bridge between the browser and the assistant, so it can quietly open a background tab, read content, and close it without any window appearing. Asking random questions and getting answers from a laptop that looks idle is strangely satisfying.\n\nThe whole philosophy of the project is that it does not try to compete with giant cloud models at writing essays. Instead it focuses on being a powerful local system automation assistant that respects privacy. The local model is smaller, but for controlling a computer it is more than enough, and the tradeoff feels worth it.\n\nWe are planning a lot next. Linux and macOS support, geofence alerts, motion triggered camera capture, scheduling and automation, longer memory, and eventually a proper mobile companion app instead of Telegram. As local models improve, the assistant will naturally get smarter too.\n\nThis started as a weekend experiment and slowly turned into something I now use daily. I would genuinely love feedback, ideas, or criticism from people here. If you have ever wanted an AI assistant that lives only on your own machine, I think you might find this interesting.\n\nGitHub Repo - [Link](https://github.com/Surajkumar5050/zyron-assistant)",

Here are some constructive suggestions to strengthen this post:\n\n**Improvements:**\n1. **Add system requirements** - Specify minimum CPU, RAM, GPU, and disk space needed to run this stack smoothly. Different models have vastly different resource needs.\n2. **Include setup time estimates** - How long does initial setup take? First model download? This helps readers decide if it's worth their time.\n3. **Provide a quick-start example** - Show a concrete workflow example (e.g., \"automate document summarization\") to demonstrate practical value.\n4. **Document troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions (port conflicts, memory limits, API key errors) would be invaluable.\n\n**Alternative Perspectives:**\n1. **Compare to other solutions** - How does this compare to Hugging Face Spaces, Replicate, or other containerized AI stacks? What are unique advantages?\n2. **Discuss trade-offs** - Self-hosting vs. cloud services (cost, maintenance burden, latency, privacy). When should someone choose this over managed solutions?\n3. **Address the learning curve** - Is this beginner-friendly or does it require Docker/DevOps knowledge?\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n1. **Security considerations** - Running multiple services locally; are there authentication/network isolation concerns?\n2. **Model licensing** - Clarify licensing implications of the 30+ pre-configured models (commercial use, attribution requirements).\n3. **Maintenance burden** - How often does this stack need updates? What's the support timeline?\n4. **Performance caveats** - Local inference can be slow; set realistic expectations vs. cloud APIs.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n1. Link to documentation for each tool (LiteLLM, n8n, Open WebUI official docs)\n2. Recommend community forums or Discord channels for support\n3. Suggest benchmarking tools to help users test performance\n4. Point to best practices for Docker Compose production deployments\n\n**Minor notes:**\n- Fix the broken vscode-file:// links in your post\n- Consider adding a screenshot or architecture diagram\n- Mention whether this supports GPU acceleration and how to enable it\n\nOverall, solid contribution to the community!",

This is supposed to allow full precision, large model operation, at the tradeoff of slow token generation.\n\nSpecifically, I want to run OLLM on my Apple Silicon Mac -- but it doesn't run (geared towards CUDA), and it only supports 3 or 4 specific models.
