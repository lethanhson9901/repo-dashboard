It offers a polished desktop experience for chatting with local LLMs, managing models, analyzing files and images, and monitoring system usage in real time.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Clean chat UI with full Markdown, code, tables, and math\n* Built-in model management (pull / delete / switch)\n* Vision + PDF / text file analysis (drag & drop)\n* AppImage distribution (download & run)\n\nBuilt with **Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + TypeScript**.\n\nFeedback and technical criticism are very welcome.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie](https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie)",

They are designed to predict the most reasonable, statistically likely series of tokens that should be emitted in response to all of their inputs. They have no ability to self-assess or fact check or even understand the semantics of what you are giving them as input.\n\nSo no, you shouldn't expect them to be accurate. The larger the model, the larger the training set and the more likely it is to match some piece of human-created information it was trained on. But as models shift to training with synthetic data and output from other models, you can imagine what happens to accuracy.\n\nWhat they ARE is reasonably inexpensive, simple to interact with natural language processors (NLPs) that can act as some reasonably reliable glue between users and tools. It's a gross oversimplification to say they can't produce useful results, but it's also incorrect to assume that they will ever be foolproof. There are certain types of interactions that they simply will never be able to perform.\n\nThere are many other types of AI and machine learning (ML) platforms besides LLMs, and the tragedy lately is that no one seems to remember that and instead are trying to build the entire AI house with nothing but a LLM hammer.\n\nOnce you realize that these are just tools for parsing human text inputs and producing some compelling, simulated text outputs, you will be better suited to figure out what they are and are not good for.",

Like if a website check times out, does it retry or just flag it?\n- For the reminder system, does it persist across restarts? That was one of the first things I had to solve with my own setup.\n- Have you thought about adding a simple web dashboard to see all your monitors at a glance?\n\nNice work for a personal project.

Many models are successful in find the needle in haystack kind of tasks but fail when asked to retrieve multiple entries from context (kind of reasoning over haystack). In this kind scenarios models often just miss data or start to hallucinate especially in the middle of the context. Best results with reasonable speed I have gained with Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning with Q6_K quant (8B with Q8_0 provide almost equal results), Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus Q4_K_M and gpt-oss-20B Q4_K_M. Qwen-3-30B does good job but is really slow as it needs offloading and still with limited context.\n\nFor testing I wrote a small Python program which generates log file of specified size with known information spread in the logs. \n\nIf anyone have good suggestions, please let me know.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI‘m looking into options to get local AI running for my company.\n\nWe do technical consulting and love to use AI for skimming through technical documents and pinpointing information down.\n\nWe are burning through Tokens and I‘m trying to save us some money but having local AI would actually allow us to use it on sensible data. Not all our customers allow cloud based AI assistance, because even when the providers say they don’t train / store data, we cannot be certain.\n\nWhat do we want to do?\n\nI envision a paperless-ngx instance where we can upload a shitton of unsorted / unknown data. We have a solid promt\n\nThat categorizes the data and indexes the files. Allocates it to the right customer / project. And makes it accessible, searchable and tags them according to our need.\n\nRight now we use cloud providers to do this, but as I mentioned before we are burning through tokens. Especially in the beginning of projects when we digitalize a wheelbarrow full of hard copies folders.\n\nMy colleague said we should just buy a Mac mini and use that as an Ollama host, but I hate Apple with a passion (while writing this on an iPhone…).\n\nI was looking at the Minisforum MS-S1 Max, hardware looks promising. I want to run Proxmox PVE 9 on it, then pass the GPU to the LXC where Ollama will reside.\n\nIs this a viable path? \n\nMy calculation is, if we spent 500€ on Tokens per month, and we can save half of that with this device, it would basically pay itself off within a year. And looking back at the last 12 months, I can see a steady increase in tokens for us. While enabling us to also process highly sensible data with AI.\n\nWhat models can I realistically run on this hardware? I was thinking something like Llama4:Maverik will probably work for us.\n\nWould you guys maybe recommend a different model for our „background“ usecase? Are there other ways to streamline our workflow maybe?\n\nTo be fair I don’t want to get rid of all cloud AI, as I fully understand that their models will always be more sophisticated and faster.\n\nLooking forward for you comments!",

Basically it will scan your documents, cut them into chunks, size at your leisure, run a search which ones apply to your question, and only put those into context. With such large PDFs you’d have to play around with a little setting called TopK inside the „documents“ settings, setting it very high. It sets how many of those chunks are loaded each time, depending on relevance.\n\nI’m pretty sure openwebui is not state of the art anymore, but it’s been working well and is quite flexible.",

Voice Assistant and automation in Home Assistant.\n\n3. Eventual Clawdbot\n\nAt the moment i tried Ai with the following setup:\n\nasrock n100m + RTX 3060 +32 GB Ram.\n\n  \nBut it use about 35 Watts in idle. I live in Germany with high energy cost. And for an 24/7 system it is too much for me. especially it will not be used every day. Paperless eventually every third day.  Voice Assistant and automation in Home Assistant 10-15 times per day.\n\nClawdbot i don't know.\n\nImportant for me is data stays at home (especially Paperless data).\n\nKnow i am thinking about a mac mini m4 base edition (16 gig unified ram and 256 ssd)\n\nHave somebody recommandations or experience with a mac mini and my use cases ?\n\nBest regards\n\nDirk\n\n",

I am building AxonFlow, a self-hosted, source-available execution control layer for local LLM workflows once they move beyond single prompts and touch real systems.\n\nThe hard part was not model quality.

It is not an agent framework or UI platform. It is the runtime layer teams end up building underneath once local workflows get serious.\n\nWorks with Ollama by pointing the client to a local endpoint.  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow](https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow)\n\nWould love feedback from folks running Ollama in real workflows.",

If you are trying to use a local LLM as the main brain for OpenClaw you will not be happy because they simply don't have the advanced reasoning capabilities of the frontier models. You need to have the main brain using a large online model and then use a local LLM as a subagent doing grunt work and that keeps the costs down. There are TONS of YouTube videos floating around right now that show how to do this.",

Make sure you set OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 on the Ollama server. By default it only listens on localhost so even though you can see the models list, the actual inference calls might fail silently.\n\n2. In your openclaw.json, the Ollama provider URL needs to point to the full address including port. Something like http://192.168.1.x:11434. Do not forget the /v1 path if your config expects OpenAI compatible endpoints.\n\nThe empty responses thing is usually a context window issue. Smaller models choke on the system prompt if the context is too small. Try bumping it up in your modelfile or use a model that handles larger contexts natively like qwen2.5 14b.\n\nAlso worth checking: are you running the model with enough VRAM? If it is swapping to CPU mid inference, it can timeout and return empty.",
