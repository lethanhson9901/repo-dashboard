      "text": "I recently got exposed to **Ollama** and the realization that I could take the 2 Billion 3 Billion parameter models and run them locally in my small pc with limited capacity of **8 GB RAM** and just an **Intel i3** CPU and without any GPU made me so excited and amazed. \n\nThough  the experience of running such Billions parameter models with 2-5 GB  RAM consumption  was not a smooth experience. Firstly I run the \"**Mistral 7B**\" model in my ollama. The response was well structured and the reasoning was good but given the limitations of my hardwares, it took about **3-4 minutes** in generating every response.\n\nFor a smoother expereience, I decided to run a smaller model. I choose Microsoft's **phi3:mini** model which was trained on around **3.8 Billion** parameters. The experience with this model was quite smoother compared to the pervious Minstral 7B model. phi3:mini took about  7-8 secods for the cold start and once it was started, it was generating responses with **less than 0.5  seconds** of prompting. I tried to measure the token generating speed using my phone's stopwatch and the number of words generated by the model (NOTE: **1 token = 0.75 word**, on average). I found out that this model was generating 7.5 tokens per second on my PC. The experience was pretty smooth with such a speed and it was also able to do all kinds of basic chat and reasoning.\n\nAfter this I decided to test the limits so I downloaded two even smaller models - **tinyLLama**. While the model was much compact with just **1.1 Billion** parameters and just 0.67GB download size for the **4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) version**, its performance deteriorated sharply.\n\nWhen I first gave a simple Hi to this model it responded with a random unrelated texts about \"nothingness\" and the paradox of nothingness. I tried to make it talk to me but it kept elaborating in its own cilo about the great philosophies around the concept of nothingness thereby not responding to  whatever prompt I gave to it. Afterwards I also tried my hand at the **smoLlm**  and this one also hallucinated massively.\n\n**My Conclusion :**\n\nMy *hardware* capacity affected the *speed* of Token generated by the different models. While the 7B parameter Mistral model took several minutes to respond each time, *this problem was eliminated entirely once I went 3.8 Billion parameters and less.* All of the phi3:mini and even the ones that hallucinated heavily - smolLm and tinyLlama generated tokens instantly.\n\nThe *number of parameters determines the extent of intelligence* of the LLM. Going below the 3.8 Billion parameter phi3:mini f, all the tiny models hallucinated excessively even though they were generating those rubbish responses very quickly and almost instantly.\n\nThere was *a tradeoff between* ***speed*** *and* ***accuracy.*** Given the limited hardware capacity of my pc, going below 3.8 Billion parameter model gave instant speed but extremely bad accuracy while going above it gave slow speed but higher accuracy.\n\nSo this was my experience about experimenting with Edge AI and various open source models. **Please feel free to correct me whereever you think I might be wrong. Questions are absolutely welcome!**",

      "text": "I've been working on this project to create a smarter LLM proxy primarily for my openwebui setup (but it's a standard openai compatible endpoint API, so it will work with anything that accepts that).\n\nThe idea is pretty simple, you see one frontend model in your system, but in the backend it can load whatever model is \"best\" for the prompt you send. When you first spin up Smarterrouter it profiles all your models, giving them scores for all the main types of prompts you could ask, as well as benchmark other things like model size, actual VRAM usage, etc. (you can even configure an external \"Judge\" AI to grade the responses the models give, i've found it improves the profile results, but it's optional). It will also detect and new or deleted models and start profiling them in the background, you don't need to do anything, just add your models to ollama and they will be added to SmarterRouter to be used.\n\nThere's a lot going on under the hood, but i've been putting it through it's paces and so far it's performing really well, It's extremely fast, It caches responses, and I'm seeing a negligible amount of time added to prompt response time. It will also automatically load and unload the models in Ollama (and any other backend that allows that).\n\nThe only caveat i've found is that currently it favors very small, high performing models, like Qwen coder 0.5B for example, but if small models are faster and they score really highly in the benchmarks... Is that really a bad response? I'm doing more digging, but so far it's working really well with all the test prompts i've given it to try (swapping to larger/different models for more complex questions or creative questions that are outside of the small models wheelhouse).\n\nHere's a high level summary of the biggest features:\n\n**Self-Correction via Hardware Profiling**: Instead of guessing performance, it runs a one-time benchmark on your specific GPU/CPU setup. It learns exactly how fast and capable your models are in your unique environment.\n\n**Active VRAM Guard**: It monitors nvidia-smi in real-time. If a model selection is about to trigger an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error, it proactively unloads idle models or chooses a smaller alternative to keep your system stable.\n\n**Semantic \"Smart\" Caching**: It doesn't just match exact text. It uses vector embeddings to recognize when you’re asking a similar question to a previous one, serving the cached response instantly and saving your compute cycles.\n\n**The \"One Model\" Illusion**: It presents your entire collection of 20+ models as a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You just select SmarterRouter in your UI, and it handles the \"load, run, unload\" logic behind the scenes.\n\n**Intelligence-to-Task Routing**: It automatically analyzes your prompt's complexity. It won't waste your 70B model's time on a \"Hello,\" and it won't let a 0.5B model hallucinate its way through a complex Python refactor.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge Feedback**: It can use a high-end model (like a cloud GPT-4o or a local heavy-hitter) to periodically \"score\" the performance of your smaller models, constantly refining its own routing weights based on actual quality.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/peva3/SmarterRouter\n\nLet me know how this works for you, I have it running perfectly with a 4060 ti 16gb, so i'm positive that it will scale well to the massive systems some of y'all have.",

This would allow something like openwebui to punch way above it's weight locally by being able to swap between all of the best models that you can fit in your GPU. \n\nSo the long long term idea is that this would be a sort of analog to how large AI companies are doing MoE prompt routing, but it would just live in your house instead of having to rely on anything outside your network.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been lurking here for a while and learning a ton from all the superusers and experts here. As a beginner myself, I often found it a bit overwhelming to figure out which models would actually run \"well\" on my specific machine versus just running \"slowly.\"\n\nTo help myself learn and to give something back to other newcomers, I put together a small CLI tool in Go called **RigRank**.\n\n**What it does:** It’s basically a simple benchmarking suite for Ollama. It doesn’t measure how \"smart\" a model is—there are way better tools for that—but it measures the \"snappiness\" of your actual hardware. It runs a few stages (code gen, summarization, reasoning, etc.) and gives you a \"Report Card\" with:\n\n* **TTFT (Time To First Token):** How long you’re waiting for that first word.\n* **Writing Speed:** How fast it actually spits out text.\n* **Reading Speed:** How quickly it processes your prompts.\n\n**Who this is for:** Honestly, if you already have a complex benchmarking pipeline or a massive GPU cluster, this probably isn't for you. It’s designed for the person who just downloaded Ollama and wants to know: *\"Is Llama3-8B too heavy for my laptop, or is it just me?\"*\n\n**I would love your feedback**\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank](https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank)",

Works as a lightweight wrapper around any Ollama call (or other providers in hybrid).\n\n**Free forever.

However, performance will be a limiting factor, and it will not be as fast as a dedicated multi-GPU setup. \n\nFeasibility and Performance\n\nThe \n\nAMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370\n\n uses unified memory, meaning the integrated GPU (iGPU) and NPU share the main system RAM. The primary limitation for running large models like a 70B LLM is memory capacity and bandwidth, not raw compute power. \n\n* **Memory Requirements**: A 70B model requires significant memory. In its original format, it could need over 80GB of VRAM or unified memory. However, using quantization (reducing the precision of the model's parameters, e.g., to 4-bit or 8-bit), the memory footprint can be reduced to around 40-56GB. Therefore, at least 64GB of system RAM is needed, with 96GB or 128GB being preferable for a smoother experience and larger context windows.\n* **Performance Expectations**: While the model can \"run,\" the speed will be slow compared to professional-grade hardware.\n   * One user successfully ran a quantized 80B model on an  [AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462826270682533,imageDocid:6622906445780665015,gpcid:1922910637295993356,headlineOfferDocid:11974420056489500570,catalogid:8464406605464093926,productDocid:3926129318797190370&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ-O7CvOGSAxVm1vACHRWwFL8Qxa4PegYIAQgFEAQ)  system with 96GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and achieved an inference speed of around **18 tokens per second** (tok/s) using the integrated graphics and `llama.cpp` optimizations.\n   * For comparison, high-end dedicated GPUs can achieve 60-100 tok/s on similar models. The  Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 's NPU, while powerful for its class (50 TOPS), is better suited for smaller 7B or 13B models and AI-specific tasks like noise reduction, rather than running a full 70B model entirely.\n* **Optimization**: Performance heavily relies on software optimization tools like `llama.cpp` and frameworks that leverage the integrated GPU (using Vulkan offloading) to manage the substantial memory demands efficiently. ",

If your corpus has noisy chunks from messy extraction, one bad retrieval in single-pass RAG becomes three or four bad retrievals in a reasoning loop. Each pass compounds the noise.\n\nThe accuracy lifts they claim probably come as much from the re-formulated queries as from the multi-pass approach itself. A decomposed question that targets specific fields (price, date, section heading) retrieves better than a vague semantic search, regardless of how many passes you do.\n\nI'd focus on the ingestion quality first. If your source data comes in as structured fields instead of raw markdown dumps, even single-pass RAG gets you most of the way there. The multi-pass stuff helps when the question genuinely requires combining info from multiple documents, but that's a smaller percentage of queries than people think.",
