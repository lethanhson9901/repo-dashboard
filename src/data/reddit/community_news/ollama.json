It offers a polished desktop experience for chatting with local LLMs, managing models, analyzing files and images, and monitoring system usage in real time.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Clean chat UI with full Markdown, code, tables, and math\n* Built-in model management (pull / delete / switch)\n* Vision + PDF / text file analysis (drag & drop)\n* AppImage distribution (download & run)\n\nBuilt with **Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + TypeScript**.\n\nFeedback and technical criticism are very welcome.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie](https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie)",

I'm not sure how the relative pricing is now, but watch for sales and HP coupon codes online. I managed to knock 10% off by just stumbling on to the right coupon code on one of those silly coupon code websites.\n\n\nI'm still just scratching the surface because my own first level interests actually lie in things like MCP and orchestration and the middleware of how you tie all this stuff together, but as I get more serious about the AI part, I suspect that this box will continue to do the heavy lifting for me in a way that I find more than acceptable, even though I know it's not exactly one of the big cloud systems.",

They are designed to predict the most reasonable, statistically likely series of tokens that should be emitted in response to all of their inputs. They have no ability to self-assess or fact check or even understand the semantics of what you are giving them as input.\n\nSo no, you shouldn't expect them to be accurate. The larger the model, the larger the training set and the more likely it is to match some piece of human-created information it was trained on. But as models shift to training with synthetic data and output from other models, you can imagine what happens to accuracy.\n\nWhat they ARE is reasonably inexpensive, simple to interact with natural language processors (NLPs) that can act as some reasonably reliable glue between users and tools. It's a gross oversimplification to say they can't produce useful results, but it's also incorrect to assume that they will ever be foolproof. There are certain types of interactions that they simply will never be able to perform.\n\nThere are many other types of AI and machine learning (ML) platforms besides LLMs, and the tragedy lately is that no one seems to remember that and instead are trying to build the entire AI house with nothing but a LLM hammer.\n\nOnce you realize that these are just tools for parsing human text inputs and producing some compelling, simulated text outputs, you will be better suited to figure out what they are and are not good for.",

If i need something multi-model (usually do) I just swap out for Qwen3-VL 4B Q4 @ 128k|256K.\n\nWorks excellent for me, no bs and if the thinking is bothering me I just turn it off. One cavet i have found is the qwen3 models you almost never want to send a simple unbounded prompt like \"Hello\" - it will easily think for 1k+ tokens just to say hello.\n\nIf you ask an actual prompt though or attach an image as context it thinks briefly and gives a great response.",

Many models are successful in find the needle in haystack kind of tasks but fail when asked to retrieve multiple entries from context (kind of reasoning over haystack). In this kind scenarios models often just miss data or start to hallucinate especially in the middle of the context. Best results with reasonable speed I have gained with Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning with Q6_K quant (8B with Q8_0 provide almost equal results), Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus Q4_K_M and gpt-oss-20B Q4_K_M. Qwen-3-30B does good job but is really slow as it needs offloading and still with limited context.\n\nFor testing I wrote a small Python program which generates log file of specified size with known information spread in the logs. \n\nIf anyone have good suggestions, please let me know.",

Because the chain of thought tokens get fed back in for subsequent token generation, it does provide the model with extra processing and those tokens do influence the final output. \n\nPersonally I normally pick instruct models or use whatever flag (i.e. /nothink) turns the thinking off. I'm not sure the benefits outweigh the extra processing time and energy for most local models. Often I just want it to be faster.\n\nIt can give a bit of extra insight too if you read the chain of thought but you have to take it with a pinch of salt!",

Having one agent that handles all of that is clean.\n\nA few questions/suggestions if you keep building on it:\n\n- How does it handle failures? Like if a website check times out, does it retry or just flag it?\n- For the reminder system, does it persist across restarts? That was one of the first things I had to solve with my own setup.\n- Have you thought about adding a simple web dashboard to see all your monitors at a glance?\n\nNice work for a personal project.

I am building AxonFlow, a self-hosted, source-available execution control layer for local LLM workflows once they move beyond single prompts and touch real systems.\n\nThe hard part was not model quality. It was making execution visible and controllable:\n\n* clear boundaries around what steps are allowed to run\n* logs tied to decisions and actions, not just model outputs\n* the ability to inspect and replay a run when something goes wrong\n\nRetries and partial failures still mattered, but only after we could see and control what happened in a run.\n\nAxonFlow sits inline between your workflow logic and LLM tool calls to make execution explicit. It is not an agent framework or UI platform. It is the runtime layer teams end up building underneath once local workflows get serious.\n\nWorks with Ollama by pointing the client to a local endpoint.  \nGitHub: [https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow](https://github.com/getaxonflow/axonflow)\n\nWould love feedback from folks running Ollama in real workflows.",

Make sure you set OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 on the Ollama server. By default it only listens on localhost so even though you can see the models list, the actual inference calls might fail silently.\n\n2. In your openclaw.json, the Ollama provider URL needs to point to the full address including port. Something like http://192.168.1.x:11434. Do not forget the /v1 path if your config expects OpenAI compatible endpoints.\n\nThe empty responses thing is usually a context window issue. Smaller models choke on the system prompt if the context is too small. Try bumping it up in your modelfile or use a model that handles larger contexts natively like qwen2.5 14b.\n\nAlso worth checking: are you running the model with enough VRAM? If it is swapping to CPU mid inference, it can timeout and return empty.",

It's a solid mid-range gaming laptop from that era, and plenty of people run similar setups for local LLMs without issues.\n\nThe 3050 Ti (laptop variant, ~80-95W TGP) has decent CUDA support, so Ollama will offload to the GPU nicely. With 6GB VRAM, you're comfortably good for:\n\n- 7B-8B models (Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Mistral/Nemo variants, Gemma 2 9B) at Q4_K_M or Q5 — these usually fit fully on GPU and spit out **25-40+ tokens/sec** on similar 3050 Ti laptops. That's snappy for chat/coding/everyday use.\n- You might squeeze in some 13B models at lower quants (Q3/Q4), but expect partial offload to system RAM → slower (~10-20 t/s), still usable though.\n\n16GB system RAM is enough; Ollama can spill over if needed, and your Ryzen 7 is a beast for any CPU fallback or hybrid stuff.\n\nFor **Moltbot** (the open-source agent thing, ex-Clawdbot, that hooks into Ollama for tool-using/agent tasks like messaging, workflows, content gen, etc.) — yep, it works great with local Ollama. Just point it at `http://localhost:11434/v1` (OpenAI-compatible endpoint), no API key nonsense. People run this exact combo on laptops like yours for fully private, no-cloud agents. Start with a lighter 7-8B instruct model tuned for tool use (Qwen 2.5 or Llama 3.1 variants often recommended for agents) to keep response times reasonable during multi-step thinking.\n\nQuick tips from folks who've done it:\n- Update NVIDIA drivers (Studio or Game Ready, latest).\n- Plug in + crank Lenovo Vantage to Performance mode, good airflow — these get toasty under load.\n- If a model feels slow, drop to Q4 or try smaller ones first.\n- Test Ollama standalone (`ollama run llama3.1:8b`) before wiring up Moltbot.\n\nOverall, no, you didn't need a beefier rig — this setup will give you a capable private AI agent without paying per token. Way better than relying on cloud stuff. If you run into VRAM errors or whatever, just grab a lower quant or smaller model. Hit me up with logs if it acts up.\n\nGo for it, OP — you'll be golden. 🚀",
