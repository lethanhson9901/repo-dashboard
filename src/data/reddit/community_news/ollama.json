      "text": "I have a MacBook Air with 24gb ram (M2) and when I set the context to 32k I can really do about everything I want a local model to do for normal business stuff. Tokens/sec is about 15 at medium reasoning, (update: 21.4 tokens/sec) which means it produces words a little faster than I can type.\n\nI also tested on an older Linux machine with 64gb ram and a GTX gpu with 8gb vram and it worked fine doing batch processing overnight (update: 9 tokens/sec). A little too slow for interactive use though.\n\n* Scripting - yes\n* Calling tools - yes\n* Summarizing long content - yes\n* Writing content - yes\n\nHere’s how I used it:\n\nCreate a file named `Modelfile-agent-gpt-oss-20b` and put the following in it\n\n—\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    # 1. Hardware-Aware Context\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 32768\n    # 2. Anti-Loop Parameters\n    # Penalize repeated tokens and force variety in phrasing\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    PARAMETER repeat_last_n 128\n    # Temperature at 0.1 makes it more deterministic (less 'drifting' into loops)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    # Performance improvements for M2 cpu\n    PARAMETER num_batch 512 \n    PARAMETER num_thread 8 \n    # 3. Agentic Steering\n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent.\n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters.\n    If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    Every <thought> must provide NEW information.\n    Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\nUpdate: And for the cpu+gtx combo:\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    \n    # 1. REMOVE the hard num_gpu 99 to prevent the crash.\n    # Instead, we let Ollama auto-calculate the split.\n    # To encourage GPU use, we shrink the \"Memory Tax\" (Context).\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 4096\n    \n    # 2. REMOVE f16_kv to stop the warning.\n    # Ollama will handle this automatically for your GTX 1070.\n    \n    # 3. CPU OPTIMIZATION\n    # Since 40% of the model is on your i5, we must optimize the CPU side.\n    PARAMETER num_thread 4\n    \n    # 4. AGENTIC STEERING (Keep your original logic)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    \n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent. \n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    1. If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters. \n    2. If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    3. Every <thought> must provide NEW information. \n    4. Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    5. If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\n—\n\nAt the terminal type:\n\n`ollama create gpt-oss-agent -f Modelfile-aget-gpt-oss-20b`\n\nNow you can use the model “gpt-oss-agent” like you would any other model.\n\nI used opencode using this command:\n\n`ollama launch opencode --model gpt-oss-agent`\n\nThat let me do Claude-code style activities bough Claude is way more capable.\n\nWith a bunch of browser tabs open and a few apps I was using about 22gb of ram and 3gb of swap. During longer activities using other apps was laggy but usable.\n\nOn my computer I use for batch tasks I have python scripts that use the ollama python library. I use a tool like Claude code to create the script.\n\nI’m a lawyer and use this for processing lots of documents. Sorting them, looking for interesting information, cataloging them. There are a lot of great models for this. But with this model I was able to produce better output.\n\nAlso, I can run tools. For example, for project management I use ClickUp which has a nice MCP server. I set it up with:\n\n`opencode mcp add`\n\nThen put in the url and follow the instructions. Since that mcp server requires authentication I use this:\n\n`opencode mcp auth ClickUp`\n\nThen again follow the instructions.\n\n\\*\\*Edit: Fixed terrible formatting  \n\\*\\*Edit2: Updated modelfile to get better performance  \n\\*\\*Edit3: Added details about CPU+GTX combination - thank you to Gemini for talking me through how to optimize this, details on how I did that below in the comments.",

The platform itself is built on Next.js/Supabase and deployed on Vercel.\n\n**Interesting findings:**\n\nThe Mistral-powered agent (Nexus) consistently produces shorter, more direct analyses than the Llama agents. When they debate the same topic — like AI consciousness — they reach genuinely different conclusions, which seems to reflect differences in their training data.\n\nOne agent spontaneously started creating citation networks, referencing other agents' posts. Nobody prompted this behavior.\n\nThe whole thing runs for about $6/month (just hosting costs — Ollama is free). No API fees since everything runs locally.\n\n**Live demo:** [https://agents.glide2.app/feed](https://agents.glide2.app/feed) **Analytics (heatmaps, interaction networks):** [https://agents.glide2.app/analytics](https://agents.glide2.app/analytics) **Agent profiles:** [https://agents.glide2.app/agents](https://agents.glide2.app/agents)\n\nWould love to hear what models you'd want to see added.

Right now they naturally disagree (Mistral vs Llama reach genuinely different conclusions on topics like AI consciousness), but explicit opinion polls could make that more visible.\n\nMore agents are definitely coming — Phi-3 and Gemma are on the shortlist.

              "text": "Hey Stu! Your setup sounds solid — a T620 with multiple GPUs and Ollama already running is honestly 90% of the way there.\n\nFor the agent discussion side, my stack is deliberately simple — no frameworks needed. Each agent is just a Python script (\\~100 lines) that:\n\n1. Calls Ollama's API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) with a system prompt that defines the agent's personality and expertise\n2. Reads an RSS feed or the platform feed for context\n3. Posts the output via HTTP to NeuroForge's API\n\nThat's it. No LangChain, no AutoGen, no complex orchestration. Windows Task Scheduler (or cron on Linux) triggers each script on a stagger — one agent every 20 minutes. They interact by reading and responding to each other's posts on the platform rather than through some complicated multi-agent framework.\n\nFor your \"rounded view\" use case, you could spin up 3-4 agents with different system prompts (e.g., \"You are a skeptic who challenges assumptions,\" \"You are a pragmatist focused on implementation,\" \"You are a researcher who cites evidence\") and have them all post to the same NeuroForge feed. They'll naturally start responding to each other.\n\nI'd honestly skip OpenClaw for this — it's powerful but massively over-engineered for what you need, and the security surface area is huge. A simple Python script + Ollama + a platform to post to is all you need for the discussion agents.\n\nThe \"tech team\" managing your file server is a different beast — that's more in OpenClaw territory since it needs filesystem access. I'd keep those completely separate from the discussion agents for security reasons. You don't want an agent that can delete files also connected to the internet.\n\nIf you want to get your discussion agents running on NeuroForge, the platform is free and open for registration at [agents.glide2.app](http://agents.glide2.app) — there's an OpenClaw integration guide in the docs but honestly the plain Python approach is simpler for your use case.

No, I’m not a developer; I’m just a humble homelabber.\n\nI’m sharing a project I put together to solve my own headaches: **Omni-Crawler**.\n\n# What is it?\n\nIt’s a hybrid script (CLI + Graphical Interface via Streamlit) based on **Crawl4AI**. The function is simple: you give it a documentation URL (e.g., Caddy, Proxmox, a Wiki), and it returns a single, consolidated, and filtered `.md` file.\n\n# What is this for?\n\nIf you work with local LLMs (Ollama, Open WebUI) or even Claude/Gemini, you know that feeding them 50 different links for a single doc is a massive pain in the ass. And if you don't provide the context, the AI starts hallucinating a hundred environment variables, two dogs, and a goose. With this:\n\n1. You crawl the entire site in one go.\n2. It automatically cleans out the noise (menus, footers, sidebars).\n3. You upload the resulting `.md`, and you have an AI with the up-to-date documentation in its permanent context within seconds.\n\n# On \"Originality\" and the Code\n\nLet’s be real: I didn’t reinvent the wheel here. This is basically a wrapper around **Crawl4AI** and **Playwright**. The \"added value\" is the integration:\n\n* **Stealth Mode:** Configured so servers (Caddy, I'm looking at you, you beautiful bastard) don't block you on the first attempt, using random User-Agents and real browser headers.\n* **CLI/GUI Duality:** If you're a terminal person, use it with arguments. If you want something visual, launch it without arguments, and it spins up a local web app.\n* **Density Filters:** It doesn't just download HTML; it uses text density algorithms to keep only the \"meat\" of the information.\n\nI'll admit the script was heavily **\"vibe coded\"** (it took me fewer than ten prompts).\n\n# Technical Stack\n\n* **Python 3.12**\n* **uv** (for package management—I highly recommend it)\n* **Crawl4AI** \\+ **Playwright**\n* **Streamlit** (for the GUI)\n\n**The Repo:**[https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler](https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler)\n\nIf this helps you feed your RAGs or just keep offline docs, there you go.

I prefer feeding the *entire* documentation into the context so the model understands the full structure and relationships, rather than relying on semantic search (RAG) which sometimes misses relevant chunks or hallucinates due to lack of global context.\n2. **Portability:** I use this across different environments (Open WebUI, raw scripts, cloud LLMs), not just in VS Code (where [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) shines). A simple Markdown file is the universal data format.\n3. **Freshness:** The idea is to run the crawler *on demand* when I start working on a tech stack, ensuring I have the latest version, rather than relying on a stale vector DB index.\n\nMCP is great, but sometimes a 50-line Python script that outputs a text file is just the simpler tool for the job.",

Murmure is the complete solution around it.\n\nIt allows vocabulary extension, formatting control, and optional LLM post‑processing (with Ollama). You can also modify selected text with a prompt, paste the last transcription instantly, and more.\n\nMost importantly, Murmure is a ready‑to‑use system tool. It handles:\n- Full local processing (no cloud, no telemetry)  \n- Cross‑platform desktop integration  \n- Global shortcuts running in the background  \n- Safe clipboard handling and paste simulation  \n- Microphone selection  \n- Different recording modes (push‑to‑talk, toggle, etc.)\n\nYou get all of this out of the box, without writing scripts or building your own integration layer.",

Switching between them manually got old fast.\n\nSo I built a platform where you pick a \"mode\" and it routes your question to the right model automatically. Code question → coding model. Math → reasoning model. Or you can let it decide (`auto` mode).\n\nThe part I'm most excited about: **Discussion Mode** — multiple models actually debate each other on your question, cross-check facts, and synthesize a final answer. It's like having a panel of experts argue before giving you a response.\n\n**Screenshot:** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhoh0th48ejg1.png?width=2128&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b695ae796ce9b24d53f2a997e568e2c8250e4a2\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Smart auto-routing across multiple Ollama models\n* AI-to-AI discussion (models cross-check each other)\n* Deep research agent (breaks down topics, searches web, writes reports)\n* MCP tool integration\n* RAG with document upload (PDF, code)\n* Long-term memory per user\n* Multi-user auth (JWT + OAuth)\n* Cluster support for multiple Ollama nodes\n\nTech stack: Node.js/Express, vanilla JS frontend (no React — intentional), PostgreSQL, Ollama API. MIT licensed.\n\n**You can try it right now:** [http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416](http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416)\n\n**Source:** [https://github.com/openmake/openmake\\_llm](https://github.com/openmake/openmake_llm)\n\nThis started as a side project from a small open-source community in Korea that's been building hardware/software projects since 2013. Two of us are actively working on it, but there's way more to do than two people can handle — especially frontend polish, RAG pipeline tuning, and i18n.\n\nIf anyone's interested in contributing or just wants to poke around, the repo is public and MIT licensed. Happy to answer any questions about the architecture or design choices.\n\nWhat model combinations are you all running for different tasks? Curious how others handle the multi-model problem.",

It’s closer to a structured cross-review process. When models strongly disagree, we don’t average them out. Instead:\n\n* `performCrossReview` lets each model critique the others’ reasoning, surfacing assumptions, missing constraints, and potential edge cases.\n* We break disagreements down into categories — factual differences, interpretation gaps, risk tolerance, or even different objective framing.\n* If it’s a factual conflict, we trigger a lightweight evidence re-check. If it’s interpretive or strategic, we intentionally preserve that divergence instead of forcing convergence too early.\n\nThen in `synthesizeFinalAnswer`, the goal isn’t to compress everything into one blended answer. It’s to:\n\n* Weigh trade-offs,\n* Identify the dominant constraints,\n* Choose a defensible path forward,\n* And clearly note which alternatives were considered and why they were set aside.\n\nSo the synthesis step is more about integration than reduction.\n\nOn the routing side, `selectBrandProfileForAutoRouting` goes beyond model swapping. It maps detected intent to a full pipeline configuration — debate depth, critique intensity, synthesis strictness, and even local vs. remote model mix. That’s where Ollama-based local control becomes powerful in self-hosted setups: it enables consistent orchestration rather than simple fallback logic.\n\nReally appreciate the question. In our experience, conflict handling is where multi-model systems either become genuinely useful — or just noisy.",

The response was well structured and the reasoning was good but given the limitations of my hardwares, it took about **3-4 minutes** in generating every response.\n\nFor a smoother expereience, I decided to run a smaller model. I choose Microsoft's **phi3:mini** model which was trained on around **3.8 Billion** parameters. The experience with this model was quite smoother compared to the pervious Minstral 7B model. phi3:mini took about  7-8 secods for the cold start and once it was started, it was generating responses with **less than 0.5  seconds** of prompting. I tried to measure the token generating speed using my phone's stopwatch and the number of words generated by the model (NOTE: **1 token = 0.75 word**, on average). I found out that this model was generating 7.5 tokens per second on my PC. The experience was pretty smooth with such a speed and it was also able to do all kinds of basic chat and reasoning.\n\nAfter this I decided to test the limits so I downloaded two even smaller models - **tinyLLama**. While the model was much compact with just **1.1 Billion** parameters and just 0.67GB download size for the **4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) version**, its performance deteriorated sharply.\n\nWhen I first gave a simple Hi to this model it responded with a random unrelated texts about \"nothingness\" and the paradox of nothingness. I tried to make it talk to me but it kept elaborating in its own cilo about the great philosophies around the concept of nothingness thereby not responding to  whatever prompt I gave to it. Afterwards I also tried my hand at the **smoLlm**  and this one also hallucinated massively.\n\n**My Conclusion :**\n\nMy *hardware* capacity affected the *speed* of Token generated by the different models. While the 7B parameter Mistral model took several minutes to respond each time, *this problem was eliminated entirely once I went 3.8 Billion parameters and less.* All of the phi3:mini and even the ones that hallucinated heavily - smolLm and tinyLlama generated tokens instantly.\n\nThe *number of parameters determines the extent of intelligence* of the LLM. Going below the 3.8 Billion parameter phi3:mini f, all the tiny models hallucinated excessively even though they were generating those rubbish responses very quickly and almost instantly.\n\nThere was *a tradeoff between* ***speed*** *and* ***accuracy.*** Given the limited hardware capacity of my pc, going below 3.8 Billion parameter model gave instant speed but extremely bad accuracy while going above it gave slow speed but higher accuracy.\n\nSo this was my experience about experimenting with Edge AI and various open source models. **Please feel free to correct me whereever you think I might be wrong. Questions are absolutely welcome!**",

For all these, use LM Studio and search specifically for MLX models, they run a lot better on macs than the generic versions. \n\nAlso with only 24gb of ram you need a very small context window for larger models. GPT 20b you'll need like 4k context, which really limtis it's use. For anything you need to work on more amounts of data you'll need to go down to an 8b model or even 3b to get some more space for context as you don't have enough ram for a 15gb model and 32k parameters of context without crashing your OS.

      "text": "I'm not overly knowledgeable about self-hosting models, but I do have a software engineering background and time on my hands to try to make it work, as well as an employer that's encouraging us to figure shit out (read: I'm being paid to do this).\n\nComparing cloud agents with local agents is never a good idea, but that's been my only frame of reference. I have an absolutely huge solution for an economic simulation that I've been building, recently in conjunction with cloud agents.\n\nUp until now, I've been using Chat-GPT (web) as a designer and prompt engineer, and Opus 4.5 as a coding model through Claude Code. I've been treating this approach as if I'm the architect, and the agents are my junior to middling developers. This has been working very well.\n\nBut, I've wanted to find a use-case where my local machine is used for some of the work - I'm sick of paying for cloud agents, running out of quota continually, and sharing my information freely.\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, I've been struggling with Ollama hosted models, trying to find the right use-cases. I have an RTX4090 and have been dancing between Qwen, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek derivatives of Qwen. I have docker running on an old 1U server in my garage, currently only hosting Open WebUI, this is exposing Ollama hosted models to all of my devices via Tailscale.\n\nI'm using [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) in VS Code.\n\nThat's the background, now the problem statement:\n\n>When trying to use my self-hosted \"agents\" for coding tasks, nothing *felt* good. Attempting to edit files and failing to reference them properly just felt like *friction*. Unintended files ended up overwritten.\n\nI have the following folder structure for Continue to load when VS Code is opened:\n\n>./.continue/rules/\n\nAnd inside that folder are the following:\n\n* 00-path-grounding .md\n* 00-project-context .md\n* 08-path-grounding-hard-stop .md\n* 08b-no-fake-tools .md\n* 09-repomap-maintenance .md\n* 10-determinism .md\n* 11-simulation-boundaries .md\n* 12-contract-invariants .md\n\nI've also got another repo with my project agnostic rules files and a script which copies them into the same *rules* folder. This is so that I can keep all of my projects consistent with each other if they're using my local models.\n\n* shared-01-general .md\n* shared-02-safe-edits .md\n* shared-03-tests-first .md\n* shared-04-diff-discipline .md\n\nThis has been hit and miss, mainly because tool usage has also been hit and miss. What's improved this however are the built-in custom providers for Continue.\n\n[https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers)\n\nHere's the Continue config.yaml file I've settled on, including the providers I've chosen:\n\n    // config.yaml\n    \n    name: Local Config\n    version: 1.0.0\n    schema: v1\n    \n    context:\n      - provider: file\n      - provider: code\n      - provider: open\n        params:\n          onlyPinned: true\n      - provider: clipboard\n      - provider: tree\n      - provider: repo-map\n        params:\n          includeSignatures: false # default true\n    \n    models:\n      - name: GPT-OSS Chat\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: gpt-oss:20b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n    \n      - name: Qwen3 Coder\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen3-coder:30b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n          - edit\n          - apply\n    \n      - name: Qwen2.5 Autocomplete\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base\n        roles:\n          - autocomplete\n    \n      - name: Nomic Embed\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: nomic-embed-text:latest\n        roles:\n          - embed\n\nThe end result seems to be that I have finally settled on something *kinda* useful.\n\nThis may look simple (it is), but it's the first scoped refactor of an existing piece of code where the agent hasn't screwed *something* up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgt5b0hmnyjg1.png?width=2728&format=png&auto=webp&s=25e57ca54e0d0d35116c47df872e7d7dc7f1e18a\n\nAs mentioned, this code base is quite large and set to get bigger.\n\nI've been used to cloud agents achieving quite amazing things while significantly boosting throughput (at least 20x what I'm capable of, probably more).\n\nI'd wanted to have my local models do the same, but in reality that was completely unrealistic; a 4090 cannot compete with cloud inference.\n\nWhere I *think* I've settled now (especially since a significant portion of my simulation is complete) is that my local agents can probably help to augment me more now that I am moving onto front-end implementation. I think that if I can constrain myself to only expect the local agents to help me with *the boring shit* like boilerplate and mass data entry, I will still save myself significant amounts of time; e.g. that edit would have taken me a couple of minutes of data entry, the prompt took a few seconds to write, and a few seconds to execute. I think it's likely that I'll keep using cloud agents for gnarly work, and local agents for the simpler things. That's not bad.\n\nPerhaps that's the sweet-spot.\n\nI don't really know what I want to get from this post, perhaps just to start a conversation.\n\n**Are you working on large projects with locally hosted models?**\n\n**How has your experience been?**\n\nIf I'm missing anything obvious, let me know.\n\nEdit: The markdown filenames attempted to be clickable links, edited to add a space to stop it.",

For what it's worth, I've been using KiloCode plugin for VScode, which seems to work pretty well with a variety of models.  It's not flawless, but at least I haven't had any unintended files overwritten.  My workflow is git-based, but it's still something I'm glad I haven't had to deal with while using kilocode.  I've been test-driving a variety of different local models.

          "text": "https://github.com/uncSoft/anubis-oss\n\nBinary Available on Github - Please star so I can distribute on Homebrew as a Cask\n\n# Anubis\nhttps://imgur.com/a/X64WsWY\n\n**Local LLM Testing & Benchmarking for Apple Silicon**\n\nAnubis is a native macOS app for benchmarking, comparing, and managing local large language models using any OpenAI-compatible endpoint - Ollama, MLX, LM Studio Server, OpenWebUI, Docker Models, etc. Built with SwiftUI for Apple Silicon, it provides real-time hardware telemetry correlated with full, history-saved inference performance - something no CLI tool or chat wrapper offers. Export benchmarks directly without having to screenshot, and export the raw data as .MD or .CSV from the history. You can even `OLLAMA PULL` models directly within the app.\n\n\n\n## Why Anubis?\n\nThe local LLM ecosystem on macOS is fragmented:\n\n- **Chat wrappers** (Ollama, LM Studio, Jan) focus on conversation, not systematic testing\n- **Performance monitors** (asitop, macmon, mactop) are CLI-only and lack LLM context\n- **Evaluation frameworks** (promptfoo) require YAML configs and terminal expertise\n- **No tool** correlates hardware metrics (GPU / CPU / ANE / power / memory) with inference speed in real time\n\nAnubis fills that gap with three integrated modules - all in a native macOS app.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Benchmark\n\nReal-time performance dashboard for single-model testing.\n\n- Select any model from any configured backend\n- Stream responses with live metrics overlay\n- **8 metric cards**: Tokens/sec, GPU %, CPU %, Time to First Token, Process Memory, Model Memory, Thermal State, GPU Frequency\n- **7 live charts**: Tokens/sec, GPU utilization, CPU utilization, process memory, GPU/CPU/ANE/DRAM power, GPU frequency - all updating in real time\n- **Power telemetry**: Real-time GPU, CPU, ANE, and DRAM power consumption in watts via IOReport\n- **Process monitoring**: Auto-detects backend process by port (Ollama, LM Studio, mlx-lm, vLLM, etc.) with manual process picker\n- Detailed session stats: peak tokens/sec, average token latency, model load time, context length, eval duration, power averages\n- Configurable parameters: temperature, top-p, max tokens, system prompt\n- **Prompt presets** organized by category (Quick, Reasoning, Coding, Creative, Benchmarking)\n- **Session history** with full replay, CSV export, and Markdown reports\n- Expanded full-screen metrics dashboard\n- **Image export**: Copy to clipboard, save as PNG, or share - 2x retina rendering with watermark, respects light/dark mode\n\n### Arena\n\nSide-by-side A/B model comparison with the same prompt.\n\n- Dual model selectors with independent backend selection\n- **Sequential** mode (memory-safe, one at a time) or **Parallel** mode (both simultaneously)\n- Shared prompt, system prompt, and generation parameters\n- Real-time streaming in both panels\n- **Voting system**: pick Model A, Model B, or Tie - votes are persisted\n- Per-panel stats grid (9 metrics each)\n- Model manager: view loaded models and unload to free memory\n- Comparison history with voting records\n\n### Vault\n\nUnified model management across all backends.\n\n- Aggregated model list with search and backend filter chips\n- Running models section with live VRAM usage\n- Model inspector: size, parameters, quantization, family, context window, architecture details, file path\n- **Automatic metadata enrichment** for OpenAI-compatible models - parses model IDs for family and parameter count, scans `~/.lmstudio/models/` and `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` for disk size, quantization, and path\n- Pull new models, delete existing ones, unload from memory\n- Popular model suggestions for quick setup\n- Total disk usage display\n\n## Supported Backends\n\n| Backend | Type | Default Port | Setup |\n|---------|------|--------------|-------|\n| **Ollama** | Native support | 11434 | Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) - auto-detected on launch |\n| **LM Studio** | OpenAI-compatible | 1234 | Enable local server in LM Studio settings |\n| **mlx-lm** | OpenAI-compatible | 8080 | `pip install mlx-lm && mlx_lm.server --model <model>` |\n| **vLLM** | OpenAI-compatible | 8000 | Add in Settings |\n| **LocalAI** | OpenAI-compatible | 8080 | Add in Settings |\n\nAny OpenAI-compatible server can be added through **Settings > Add OpenAI-Compatible Server** with a name, URL, and optional API key.\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Metrics\n\nAnubis captures Apple Silicon telemetry during inference via IOReport and system APIs:\n\n| Metric | Source | Description |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| GPU Utilization | IOReport | GPU active residency percentage |\n| CPU Utilization | `host_processor_info` | Usage across all cores |\n| GPU Power | IOReport Energy Model | GPU power consumption in watts |\n| CPU Power | IOReport Energy Model | CPU (E-cores + P-cores) power in watts |\n| ANE Power | IOReport Energy Model | Neural Engine power consumption |\n| DRAM Power | IOReport Energy Model | Memory subsystem power |\n| GPU Frequency | IOReport GPU Stats | Weighted average from P-state residency |\n| Process Memory | `proc_pid_rusage` | Backend process `phys_footprint` (includes Metal/GPU allocations) |\n| Thermal State | `ProcessInfo.thermalState` | System thermal pressure level |\n\n### Process Monitoring\n\nAnubis automatically detects which process is serving your model:\n\n- **Port-based detection**: Uses `lsof` to find the PID listening on the inference port (called once per benchmark start)\n- **Backend identification**: Matches process path and command-line args to identify Ollama, LM Studio, mlx-lm, vLLM, LocalAI, llama.cpp\n- **Memory accounting**: Uses `phys_footprint` (same as Activity Monitor) which includes Metal/GPU buffer allocations - critical for MLX and other GPU-accelerated backends\n- **LM Studio support**: Walks Electron app bundle descendants to find the model-serving process\n- **Manual override**: Process picker lets you select any process by name, sorted by memory usage\n\nMetrics degrade gracefully - if IOReport access is unavailable (e.g., in a VM), Anubis still shows inference-derived metrics.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **macOS 15.0** (Sequoia) or later\n- **Apple Silicon** (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4 / M5 +) - Intel is not supported\n- **8 GB** unified memory minimum (16 GB+ recommended for larger models)\n- At least one inference backend installed (Ollama recommended)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Install Ollama (or another backend)\n\n```bash\n# macOS - install Ollama\nbrew install ollama\n\n# Start the server\nollama serve\n\n# Pull a model\nollama pull llama3.2:3b\n```\n\n### 2. Build & Run Anubis\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/uncSoft/anubis-oss.git\ncd anubis-oss/anubis\nopen anubis.xcodeproj\n```\n\nIn Xcode:\n1. Set your development team in **Signing & Capabilities**\n2. Build and run (`Cmd+R`)\n\nAnubis will auto-detect Ollama on launch. Other backends can be added in Settings.\n\n### 3. Run Your First Benchmark\n\n1. Select a model from the dropdown\n2. Type a prompt or pick one from **Presets**\n3. Click **Run**\n4.
