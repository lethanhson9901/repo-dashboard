If you're interested in AI agents, RAG, browser extensions, or building open-source research tools, this is a great place to jump in.\n\nHere's a quick look at what SurfSense offers right now:\n\n**Features**\n\n* Deep Agent with Built-in Tools (knowledge base search, podcast generation, web scraping, link previews, image display)\n* Note Management (Notion like)\n* RBAC (Role Based Access for Teams)\n* Supports 100+ LLMs\n* Supports local Ollama or vLLM setups\n* 6000+ Embedding Models\n* 50+ File extensions supported (Added Docling recently)\n* Podcasts support with local TTS providers (Kokoro TTS)\n* Connects with 15+ external sources such as Search Engines, Slack, Notion, Gmail, Notion, Confluence etc\n* Cross-Browser Extension to let you save any dynamic webpage you want, including authenticated content.\n\n**Upcoming Planned Features**\n\n* Multi Collaborative Chats\n* Multi Collaborative Documents\n\n**Installation (Self-Host)**\n\n# Linux/macOS:\n\n    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 \\\n      -v surfsense-data:/data \\\n      --name surfsense \\\n      --restart unless-stopped \\\n      ghcr.io/modsetter/surfsense:latest\n\n# Windows (PowerShell):\n\n    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -p 8000:8000 `\n      -v surfsense-data:/data `\n      --name surfsense `\n      --restart unless-stopped `\n      ghcr.io/modsetter/surfsense:latest\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense](https://github.com/MODSetter/SurfSense)",

Ollama setups can chat with docs, but once you have lots of PDFs or long context it turns into a bunch of DIY work. That got old fast for me. NotebookLM is nice but slow and limited, so I ended up moving to Nouswise. Not self hosted, but way smoother for long docs and keeping notes connected without redoing context all the time. For studying and research the workflow mattered more to me than running everything locally.",

Can such a small local model do reliable tool calling, and can you extend it beyond local tools to work with remotely hosted MCP servers?\n\nHere’s what I tried:\n\n# Setup\n\n* Ran a quantized 4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) Ministral 3 3B on Ollama\n* Connected it to Open WebUI (with Docker)\n* Tested tool calling in two stages:\n   * Local Python tools inside Open WebUI\n   * **Remote MCP tools** via Composio (so the model can call externally hosted tools through MCP)\n\nThe model, despite the super tiny size of just 3B parameters, is said to support tool calling with even support for structured output. So, this was really fun to see the model in action.\n\nMost of the guides show you how to work with just the local tools, which is not ideal when you plan to use the model for bigger, better and managed tools for hundreds of different services. \n\nIn this guide, I've covered the model specs and the entire setup, including setting up a Docker container for Ollama and running Ollama WebUI.\n\nAnd the nice part is that the model setup guide here works for all the other models that support tool calling.\n\nI wrote up the full walkthrough with commands and screenshots:\n\nYou can find it here: [MCP tool calling guide with Ministral 3B, Composio, and Ollama](https://composio.dev/blog/tool-calling-with-ministral-3b)\n\nIf anyone else has tested tool calling on Ministral 3 3B (or worked with it using vLLM instead of Ollama), I’d love to hear what worked best for you, as I couldn't get vLLM to work due to CUDA errors. :(",

It sees \"leak\" or \".onion\" and shuts down, even with jailbreak prompts. Regex captures emails but misses the context (like company names or data volume). Any recommendations for an uncensored 7B model that handles this well, or should I switch to a BERT model for extraction?",

They can plan research, but they can't browse the docs. I got sick of the \"Chat -> Copy Code -> Alt-Tab -> Paste -> Error\" loop.\n\nThe Project (Runiq): I didn't want another fragile Python wrapper that breaks my venv every week. So I built a standalone MCP Server in Go.\n\nWhat it actually does:\n\nFile System Access: You prompt: \"Refactor the ./src folder.\" Runiq actually reads the files, sends the context to Ollama, and applies the edits locally.\n\nStealth Browser: You prompt: \"Check the docs at stripe.com.\" It spins up a headless browser (bypassing Cloudflare) to give the model real-time context.\n\nThe \"Air Gap\" Firewall: Giving a local model root is scary. Runiq intercepts every write or delete syscall. You get a native OS popup to approve the action. It can't wipe your drive unless you say yes.\n\nWhy Go?\n\nSpeed: It's instant.\n\nPortability: Single 12MB binary. No pip install, no Docker.\n\nSafety: Memory safe and strictly typed.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/qaysSE/runiq\n\nI built this to turn my local Ollama setup into a fully autonomous agent.

Here is what we have that would actually fit inside of your 6GB VRAM budget.  I am deliberately leaving out any models that anybody suggested that would not have fit inside of your 6GB VRAM budget! 🤗\n\n* \\`[qwen3:4b](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3:4b)\\` size=2.5GB\n* \\`[ministral-3:3b](https://ollama.com/library/ministral-3:3b)\\` size=3.0GB\n* \\`[gemma3:1b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:1b)\\` size=815MB\n* \\`[gemma3:4b](https://ollama.com/library/gemma3:4b)\\` size=3.3GB 👈 I added this one because it is a little bigger than the `gemma3:1b`, but still fits confortably inside of your 6GB VRAM budget.  This model should be more capable than `gemma3:1b`.\n\nI would suggest that you first try these models with `ollama run MODELNAME` and check to see how they fit in your VRAM (`ollama ps`) and check them for performance (`/set verbose`).\n\nWhat do you think?",

Do the **paid Ollama plans** support this level of token throughput (5–10M tokens/day)?\n2. Are there **hard daily or monthly token caps** per model or per account?\n3. How are **API requests counted** internally by Ollama for each prompt/response cycle?\n4. Does a single `ollama run` execution map to **one API request**, or can it generate multiple internal calls depending on response length?\n5. Are there **per-model limitations** (rate limits, concurrency, max tokens) for large cloud models like DeepSeek 671B or Kimi-K2 1T?\n\nI’m trying to determine whether the current **paid offering can reliably sustain this workload** or if additional arrangements (enterprise plans, quotas, etc.) are required.\n\nAny insights from the Ollama team or experienced users running high-volume workloads would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hi there, I'm interested how you guys set up ollama to work on tasks.\n\nThe first thing we already tried is having a Python script that calls the company internal Ollama via api with simple tasks in a loop. Imagine pseudocode:\n\n    for sourcecode in repository: \n      api-call-to-ollama(\"Please do a sourcecode review: \" + sourcecode)    \n\nWe tried multiple tasks like this for **multiple usecases, not just sourcecode reviews** and the intelligence is quite promising but ofc the context the LLMs have available to solve tasks like that limiting.\n\nSo the second idea is to somehow let the LLM make the decision what to include in a prompt. Let's call them \"pretasks\".\n\nThis pretask could be a prompt saying ´\"Write a prompt to an LLM to do a sourcecode review. You can decide to include adjacent PDFs, Jira tickets, pieces of sourcecode by writing <include:filename>\" + list-of-available-files-with-descriptions-what-they-are´. The python script would then parse the result of the pretask to collect the relevant files.\n\nThird and finally, at that point we could let the pretask trigger itself even more pretasks. This is where the thing would be almost bootstrapped. But I'm out of ideas how to coordinate this, prevent endless loops etc.\n\nSorry if my thoughts around this whole topic are a little scattered. I assume the whole world is right now thinking about these kinds of workflows. So I'd like to know where to start reading about it.",

From what I can tell, when ollama starts truncating (at least on linux) or the model runs out of context, it just hangs there. So, you have to set things up so you don’t run out of context. I’ve noticed this particularly with open-webui and Qwen3-next locally. The fix was to create a model definition in open-webui that had an explicit context setting and use that for the locally task and and external task model there. In other cases, you probably just need to push the context window higher.\n\nI \\*think\\* there’s a bug somewhere in the Ollama code in how it handles truncation and/or the Qwen3-next model really doesn’t like running into the end of the context window. It’s really annoying because a lot of stuff sets a 4096 or 2048 sized context window by default. (edit: fix typos … dang phone keyboard…)",
