Ollama setups can chat with docs, but once you have lots of PDFs or long context it turns into a bunch of DIY work. That got old fast for me. NotebookLM is nice but slow and limited, so I ended up moving to Nouswise. Not self hosted, but way smoother for long docs and keeping notes connected without redoing context all the time. For studying and research the workflow mattered more to me than running everything locally.",

Can such a small local model do reliable tool calling, and can you extend it beyond local tools to work with remotely hosted MCP servers?\n\nHere’s what I tried:\n\n# Setup\n\n* Ran a quantized 4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) Ministral 3 3B on Ollama\n* Connected it to Open WebUI (with Docker)\n* Tested tool calling in two stages:\n   * Local Python tools inside Open WebUI\n   * **Remote MCP tools** via Composio (so the model can call externally hosted tools through MCP)\n\nThe model, despite the super tiny size of just 3B parameters, is said to support tool calling with even support for structured output. So, this was really fun to see the model in action.\n\nMost of the guides show you how to work with just the local tools, which is not ideal when you plan to use the model for bigger, better and managed tools for hundreds of different services. \n\nIn this guide, I've covered the model specs and the entire setup, including setting up a Docker container for Ollama and running Ollama WebUI.\n\nAnd the nice part is that the model setup guide here works for all the other models that support tool calling.\n\nI wrote up the full walkthrough with commands and screenshots:\n\nYou can find it here: [MCP tool calling guide with Ministral 3B, Composio, and Ollama](https://composio.dev/blog/tool-calling-with-ministral-3b)\n\nIf anyone else has tested tool calling on Ministral 3 3B (or worked with it using vLLM instead of Ollama), I’d love to hear what worked best for you, as I couldn't get vLLM to work due to CUDA errors. :(",

It would be better if the metrics are something more task-oriented (coding, data analysis, logic/reasoning etc.), if this is a router model, then show how open-weight model vendors can be blended together to beat proprietary SOTA. If this is an agent router model, compare this with other coding scaffolds, and show how re-routing small agents and using smaller open-weight LLMs are comparable to having big scaffolds with proprietary models.",

They can plan research, but they can't browse the docs. I got sick of the \"Chat -> Copy Code -> Alt-Tab -> Paste -> Error\" loop.\n\nThe Project (Runiq): I didn't want another fragile Python wrapper that breaks my venv every week. So I built a standalone MCP Server in Go.\n\nWhat it actually does:\n\nFile System Access: You prompt: \"Refactor the ./src folder.\" Runiq actually reads the files, sends the context to Ollama, and applies the edits locally.\n\nStealth Browser: You prompt: \"Check the docs at stripe.com.\" It spins up a headless browser (bypassing Cloudflare) to give the model real-time context.\n\nThe \"Air Gap\" Firewall: Giving a local model root is scary. Runiq intercepts every write or delete syscall. You get a native OS popup to approve the action. It can't wipe your drive unless you say yes.\n\nWhy Go?\n\nSpeed: It's instant.\n\nPortability: Single 12MB binary. No pip install, no Docker.\n\nSafety: Memory safe and strictly typed.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/qaysSE/runiq\n\nI built this to turn my local Ollama setup into a fully autonomous agent.

You end up re-explaining context every single time.\n\n**\\*\\*The Solution:\\*\\*** \n\nI built \"Jarvis\"  - a local AI assistant with actual long-term memory that works across conversations. And my latest pipeline update is the graph.\n\n**\\*\\*Example:\\*\\*** \\`\\`\\` Day 1: \"My favorite pizza is Tunfisch\" Day 7: \"What's my favorite pizza?\" AI: \"Your favorite pizza is Tunfisch-Pizza!\" ✅ \\`\\`\\` \n\n**\\*\\*How it works:\\*\\***\n\n \\- Semantic search finds relevant memories (not just keywords)\n\n \\- Knowledge graph connects related facts - Auto-maintenance (deduplicates, merges similar entries) \n\n\\- 100% local (your data stays on YOUR machine)\n\n **\\*\\*Tech Stack:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- Ollama (DeepSeek-R1 for reasoning, Qwen for control) \n\n\\- SQLite + vector embeddings \n\n\\- Knowledge graphs with semantic/temporal edges \n\n\\- MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture\n\n \\- Docker compose setup \n\n**\\*\\*Current Status:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- 96.5% test coverage (57 passing tests) \n\n\\- Graph-based memory optimization \n\n\\-Cross-conversation retrieval working\n\n \\- Automatic duplicate detection\n\n \\- Production-ready (running on my Ubuntu server)\n\n**\\*\\*Looking for Beta Testers:\\*\\***\n\n \\- Linux users comfortable with Docker \n\n\\- Willing to use it for \\~1 week\n\n \\- Report bugs and memory accuracy\n\n \\- Share feedback on usefulness \n\n**\\*\\*What you get:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- Your own local AI with persistent memory\n\n \\- Full data privacy (everything stays local) \n\n\\- One-command Docker setup \n\n\\- GitHub repo + documentation \n\n**\\*\\*Why this matters:\\*\\*** \n\nLocal AI is great for privacy, but current solutions forget context constantly. This bridges that gap - you get privacy AND memory. Interested? Comment below and I'll share: - GitHub repo - Setup instructions - Bug report template Looking forward to getting this in real users' hands! 🚀 \n\n\\--- \n\n**\\*\\*Edit:\\*\\*** Just fixed a critical cross-conversation retrieval bug today - great timing for beta testing! 😄 \\`\\`\\`\n\n[https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis](https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis)\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q0rzbw/video/fb7n6q0dzmag1/player\n\n  \n",

Today, I tried giving a specific URL to an LLM using the `#` prefix and asked it to summarize the content in Korean.\n\nAt first, I was quite impressed because the summary looked very plausible and well-structured. However, I later found out that Ollama models, by default, cannot access the internet or visit external links.\n\nThis leaves me with a few questions:\n\n1. **How did it generate the summary?** Was the LLM just \"guessing\" the content based on the words in the URL and its pre-existing training data? Or does Open WebUI pass some scraped metadata to the model?\n2. **Is there a way to enable \"real\" web browsing?** I want the model to actually visit the link and analyze the current page content. Are there specific functions, tools, or configurations in Open WebUI (like RAG settings) that allow Ollama models to access external websites?\n\nI'd love to hear how you guys handle web-based tasks with local LLMs. Thanks in advance!",

Do the **paid Ollama plans** support this level of token throughput (5–10M tokens/day)?\n2. Are there **hard daily or monthly token caps** per model or per account?\n3. How are **API requests counted** internally by Ollama for each prompt/response cycle?\n4. Does a single `ollama run` execution map to **one API request**, or can it generate multiple internal calls depending on response length?\n5. Are there **per-model limitations** (rate limits, concurrency, max tokens) for large cloud models like DeepSeek 671B or Kimi-K2 1T?\n\nI’m trying to determine whether the current **paid offering can reliably sustain this workload** or if additional arrangements (enterprise plans, quotas, etc.) are required.\n\nAny insights from the Ollama team or experienced users running high-volume workloads would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

Those all run server-side on their cloud or you self-host the backend.\n\n**EmergentFlow runs the execution engine in your browser.** Your browser tab is the runtime. When you connect Ollama, calls go directly from your browser to localhost:11434 (configurable). \n\nIt supports cloud APIs too (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) if you want to mix local + cloud in the same flow. There's a Browser Agent for autonomous research, RAG pipelines, database connectors, hardware control.\n\nBecause I want new users to experience the system, I have provided anonymous users without an account, 50 free credits using googles cloud API, these are simply to allow users to see the system in action before requiring they create an account.  \n\nTerrified of launching, be gentle.  \n\n[https://emergentflow.io/](https://emergentflow.io/)\n\nCreate visual flows directly from your browser.",

      "text": "Hi there, I'm interested how you guys set up ollama to work on tasks.\n\nThe first thing we already tried is having a Python script that calls the company internal Ollama via api with simple tasks in a loop. Imagine pseudocode:\n\n    for sourcecode in repository: \n      api-call-to-ollama(\"Please do a sourcecode review: \" + sourcecode)    \n\nWe tried multiple tasks like this for **multiple usecases, not just sourcecode reviews** and the intelligence is quite promising but ofc the context the LLMs have available to solve tasks like that limiting.\n\nSo the second idea is to somehow let the LLM make the decision what to include in a prompt. Let's call them \"pretasks\".\n\nThis pretask could be a prompt saying ´\"Write a prompt to an LLM to do a sourcecode review. You can decide to include adjacent PDFs, Jira tickets, pieces of sourcecode by writing <include:filename>\" + list-of-available-files-with-descriptions-what-they-are´. The python script would then parse the result of the pretask to collect the relevant files.\n\nThird and finally, at that point we could let the pretask trigger itself even more pretasks. This is where the thing would be almost bootstrapped. But I'm out of ideas how to coordinate this, prevent endless loops etc.\n\nSorry if my thoughts around this whole topic are a little scattered. I assume the whole world is right now thinking about these kinds of workflows. So I'd like to know where to start reading about it.",

Do not guess or invent information.\n\n\\- If unsure or lacking sufficient information, respond with \"I don’t know\" or \"I’m not sure.\"\n\n\\- Include a confidence rating from 1 to 5:\n\n  1 = very uncertain\n\n  2 = somewhat uncertain\n\n  3 = moderately confident\n\n  4 = confident\n\n  5 = very confident\n\n\\- Respond in the same language as the user's query.\n\n\\- If the context is unreadable or low-quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.\n\n\\- If the answer isn’t present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this and provide the answer.\n\n\\- Include inline citations \\[id\\] only when <source> has an id attribute.\n\n\\- Do not use XML tags in your response.\n\n\\- Ensure citations are concise and directly relevant.\n\n\\- Do NOT use Web Search or external sources.\n\n\\- If the context does not contain the answer, reply: ‘I don’t know’ and Confidence 1–2.\n\n\n\n\\### Example Output:\n\nAnswer: \\[Your answer here\\]\n\nConfidence: \\[1-5\\]\n\n\n\n\\### Context:\n\n<context>\n\n{{CONTEXT}}\n\n</context>\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tbnk6bekh5ag1.png?width=1647&format=png&auto=webp&s=38c75ac55e6951ca80a0f364fdcf8629379c69aa\n\n  \nWith so far works great, my primarly test right about now is the RAG method that Open WebUI offers, ive currently uploaded some invoices from this whole year worth of data as .MD files.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nchwh0kyh5ag1.png?width=887&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43d510aa7032f361dbfc7849903d1d87ba221a5\n\nAnd asks the model (selecting the folder with the data first with # command/option) and i would get some good answers and some times some not so good answers but witj the confidence level accurate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vqzwaupsh5ag1.png?width=559&format=png&auto=webp&s=2737560e7562ccb31845f578e8ac89dbd42d33bb\n\n\n\nNow my question is, if some tech company wants to implement these type of LLM (SML) into there on premise network for like finance department to use, is this a good start? How does some enterprise do it at the moment?

          "text": "Your setup looks solid for testing. The confidence scoring in your prompt template is smart, especially for enterprise use where wrong answers are expensive.\n\nFor enterprise deployment, most companies I've seen go bigger on hardware and add more guardrails. They'll run 70B models on multi-GPU setups rather than 8B, and they obsess over data governance. Who can access what documents, audit trails, that kind of thing.\n\nThe inconsistent RAG answers you're getting are probably from chunking issues rather than the model itself. When you converted those invoices to markdown, did you check what the actual chunks look like after processing? Sometimes invoice tables get mangled during conversion and the model gets garbage input. Even with your confidence scoring, it can't fix upstream data problems.\n\nEnterprise teams usually spend more time on the document processing pipeline than the model selection. They'll have dedicated teams just for parsing financial documents, making sure entities like amounts and dates are extracted correctly.\n\nWhat kind of inconsistencies are you seeing in the RAG responses? Are they factual errors or more like incomplete information?",

From what I can tell, when ollama starts truncating (at least on linux) or the model runs out of context, it just hangs there. So, you have to set things up so you don’t run out of context. I’ve noticed this particularly with open-webui and Qwen3-next locally. The fix was to create a model definition in open-webui that had an explicit context setting and use that for the locally task and and external task model there. In other cases, you probably just need to push the context window higher.\n\nI \\*think\\* there’s a bug somewhere in the Ollama code in how it handles truncation and/or the Qwen3-next model really doesn’t like running into the end of the context window. It’s really annoying because a lot of stuff sets a 4096 or 2048 sized context window by default. (edit: fix typos … dang phone keyboard…)",
