I get why folks might be worried about being stuck with one model, especially since AI is evolving at breakneck speed. But on the flip side, the idea of super fast and cheap inference is pretty appealing, especially for use cases where you just need reliable performance and aren't as concerned about having the absolute latest model. It reminds me of how GPUs transformed gaming performance. This could really shake things up for certain applications. What do you guys think—worth the risk or too limiting?",

      "text": "I recently got exposed to **Ollama** and the realization that I could take the 2 Billion 3 Billion parameter models and run them locally in my small pc with limited capacity of **8 GB RAM** and just an **Intel i3** CPU and without any GPU made me so excited and amazed. \n\nThough  the experience of running such Billions parameter models with 2-5 GB  RAM consumption  was not a smooth experience. Firstly I run the \"**Mistral 7B**\" model in my ollama. The response was well structured and the reasoning was good but given the limitations of my hardwares, it took about **3-4 minutes** in generating every response.\n\nFor a smoother expereience, I decided to run a smaller model. I choose Microsoft's **phi3:mini** model which was trained on around **3.8 Billion** parameters. The experience with this model was quite smoother compared to the pervious Minstral 7B model. phi3:mini took about  7-8 secods for the cold start and once it was started, it was generating responses with **less than 0.5  seconds** of prompting. I tried to measure the token generating speed using my phone's stopwatch and the number of words generated by the model (NOTE: **1 token = 0.75 word**, on average). I found out that this model was generating 7.5 tokens per second on my PC. The experience was pretty smooth with such a speed and it was also able to do all kinds of basic chat and reasoning.\n\nAfter this I decided to test the limits so I downloaded two even smaller models - **tinyLLama**. While the model was much compact with just **1.1 Billion** parameters and just 0.67GB download size for the **4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) version**, its performance deteriorated sharply.\n\nWhen I first gave a simple Hi to this model it responded with a random unrelated texts about \"nothingness\" and the paradox of nothingness. I tried to make it talk to me but it kept elaborating in its own cilo about the great philosophies around the concept of nothingness thereby not responding to  whatever prompt I gave to it. Afterwards I also tried my hand at the **smoLlm**  and this one also hallucinated massively.\n\n**My Conclusion :**\n\nMy *hardware* capacity affected the *speed* of Token generated by the different models. While the 7B parameter Mistral model took several minutes to respond each time, *this problem was eliminated entirely once I went 3.8 Billion parameters and less.* All of the phi3:mini and even the ones that hallucinated heavily - smolLm and tinyLlama generated tokens instantly.\n\nThe *number of parameters determines the extent of intelligence* of the LLM. Going below the 3.8 Billion parameter phi3:mini f, all the tiny models hallucinated excessively even though they were generating those rubbish responses very quickly and almost instantly.\n\nThere was *a tradeoff between* ***speed*** *and* ***accuracy.*** Given the limited hardware capacity of my pc, going below 3.8 Billion parameter model gave instant speed but extremely bad accuracy while going above it gave slow speed but higher accuracy.\n\nSo this was my experience about experimenting with Edge AI and various open source models. **Please feel free to correct me whereever you think I might be wrong. Questions are absolutely welcome!**",

When you first spin up Smarterrouter it profiles all your models, giving them scores for all the main types of prompts you could ask, as well as benchmark other things like model size, actual VRAM usage, etc. (you can even configure an external \"Judge\" AI to grade the responses the models give, i've found it improves the profile results, but it's optional). It will also detect and new or deleted models and start profiling them in the background, you don't need to do anything, just add your models to ollama and they will be added to SmarterRouter to be used.\n\nThere's a lot going on under the hood, but i've been putting it through it's paces and so far it's performing really well, It's extremely fast, It caches responses, and I'm seeing a negligible amount of time added to prompt response time. It will also automatically load and unload the models in Ollama (and any other backend that allows that).\n\nThe only caveat i've found is that currently it favors very small, high performing models, like Qwen coder 0.5B for example, but if small models are faster and they score really highly in the benchmarks... Is that really a bad response? I'm doing more digging, but so far it's working really well with all the test prompts i've given it to try (swapping to larger/different models for more complex questions or creative questions that are outside of the small models wheelhouse).\n\nHere's a high level summary of the biggest features:\n\n**Self-Correction via Hardware Profiling**: Instead of guessing performance, it runs a one-time benchmark on your specific GPU/CPU setup. It learns exactly how fast and capable your models are in your unique environment.\n\n**Active VRAM Guard**: It monitors nvidia-smi in real-time. If a model selection is about to trigger an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error, it proactively unloads idle models or chooses a smaller alternative to keep your system stable.\n\n**Semantic \"Smart\" Caching**: It doesn't just match exact text. It uses vector embeddings to recognize when you’re asking a similar question to a previous one, serving the cached response instantly and saving your compute cycles.\n\n**The \"One Model\" Illusion**: It presents your entire collection of 20+ models as a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You just select SmarterRouter in your UI, and it handles the \"load, run, unload\" logic behind the scenes.\n\n**Intelligence-to-Task Routing**: It automatically analyzes your prompt's complexity. It won't waste your 70B model's time on a \"Hello,\" and it won't let a 0.5B model hallucinate its way through a complex Python refactor.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge Feedback**: It can use a high-end model (like a cloud GPT-4o or a local heavy-hitter) to periodically \"score\" the performance of your smaller models, constantly refining its own routing weights based on actual quality.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/peva3/SmarterRouter\n\nLet me know how this works for you, I have it running perfectly with a 4060 ti 16gb, so i'm positive that it will scale well to the massive systems some of y'all have.",

This would allow something like openwebui to punch way above it's weight locally by being able to swap between all of the best models that you can fit in your GPU. \n\nSo the long long term idea is that this would be a sort of analog to how large AI companies are doing MoE prompt routing, but it would just live in your house instead of having to rely on anything outside your network.",

As a beginner myself, I often found it a bit overwhelming to figure out which models would actually run \"well\" on my specific machine versus just running \"slowly.\"\n\nTo help myself learn and to give something back to other newcomers, I put together a small CLI tool in Go called **RigRank**.\n\n**What it does:** It’s basically a simple benchmarking suite for Ollama. It doesn’t measure how \"smart\" a model is—there are way better tools for that—but it measures the \"snappiness\" of your actual hardware. It runs a few stages (code gen, summarization, reasoning, etc.) and gives you a \"Report Card\" with:\n\n* **TTFT (Time To First Token):** How long you’re waiting for that first word.\n* **Writing Speed:** How fast it actually spits out text.\n* **Reading Speed:** How quickly it processes your prompts.\n\n**Who this is for:** Honestly, if you already have a complex benchmarking pipeline or a massive GPU cluster, this probably isn't for you. It’s designed for the person who just downloaded Ollama and wants to know: *\"Is Llama3-8B too heavy for my laptop, or is it just me?\"*\n\n**I would love your feedback**\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank](https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank)",

      "text": "I'm not overly knowledgeable about self-hosting models, but I do have a software engineering background and time on my hands to try to make it work, as well as an employer that's encouraging us to figure shit out (read: I'm being paid to do this).\n\nComparing cloud agents with local agents is never a good idea, but that's been my only frame of reference. I have an absolutely huge solution for an economic simulation that I've been building, recently in conjunction with cloud agents.\n\nUp until now, I've been using Chat-GPT (web) as a designer and prompt engineer, and Opus 4.5 as a coding model through Claude Code. I've been treating this approach as if I'm the architect, and the agents are my junior to middling developers. This has been working very well.\n\nBut, I've wanted to find a use-case where my local machine is used for some of the work - I'm sick of paying for cloud agents, running out of quota continually, and sharing my information freely.\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, I've been struggling with Ollama hosted models, trying to find the right use-cases. I have an RTX4090 and have been dancing between Qwen, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek derivatives of Qwen. I have docker running on an old 1U server in my garage, currently only hosting Open WebUI, this is exposing Ollama hosted models to all of my devices via Tailscale.\n\nI'm using [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) in VS Code.\n\nThat's the background, now the problem statement:\n\n>When trying to use my self-hosted \"agents\" for coding tasks, nothing *felt* good. Attempting to edit files and failing to reference them properly just felt like *friction*. Unintended files ended up overwritten.\n\nI have the following folder structure for Continue to load when VS Code is opened:\n\n>./.continue/rules/\n\nAnd inside that folder are the following:\n\n* 00-path-grounding .md\n* 00-project-context .md\n* 08-path-grounding-hard-stop .md\n* 08b-no-fake-tools .md\n* 09-repomap-maintenance .md\n* 10-determinism .md\n* 11-simulation-boundaries .md\n* 12-contract-invariants .md\n\nI've also got another repo with my project agnostic rules files and a script which copies them into the same *rules* folder. This is so that I can keep all of my projects consistent with each other if they're using my local models.\n\n* shared-01-general .md\n* shared-02-safe-edits .md\n* shared-03-tests-first .md\n* shared-04-diff-discipline .md\n\nThis has been hit and miss, mainly because tool usage has also been hit and miss. What's improved this however are the built-in custom providers for Continue.\n\n[https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers)\n\nHere's the Continue config.yaml file I've settled on, including the providers I've chosen:\n\n    // config.yaml\n    \n    name: Local Config\n    version: 1.0.0\n    schema: v1\n    \n    context:\n      - provider: file\n      - provider: code\n      - provider: open\n        params:\n          onlyPinned: true\n      - provider: clipboard\n      - provider: tree\n      - provider: repo-map\n        params:\n          includeSignatures: false # default true\n    \n    models:\n      - name: GPT-OSS Chat\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: gpt-oss:20b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n    \n      - name: Qwen3 Coder\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen3-coder:30b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n          - edit\n          - apply\n    \n      - name: Qwen2.5 Autocomplete\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base\n        roles:\n          - autocomplete\n    \n      - name: Nomic Embed\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: nomic-embed-text:latest\n        roles:\n          - embed\n\nThe end result seems to be that I have finally settled on something *kinda* useful.\n\nThis may look simple (it is), but it's the first scoped refactor of an existing piece of code where the agent hasn't screwed *something* up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgt5b0hmnyjg1.png?width=2728&format=png&auto=webp&s=25e57ca54e0d0d35116c47df872e7d7dc7f1e18a\n\nAs mentioned, this code base is quite large and set to get bigger.\n\nI've been used to cloud agents achieving quite amazing things while significantly boosting throughput (at least 20x what I'm capable of, probably more).\n\nI'd wanted to have my local models do the same, but in reality that was completely unrealistic; a 4090 cannot compete with cloud inference.\n\nWhere I *think* I've settled now (especially since a significant portion of my simulation is complete) is that my local agents can probably help to augment me more now that I am moving onto front-end implementation. I think that if I can constrain myself to only expect the local agents to help me with *the boring shit* like boilerplate and mass data entry, I will still save myself significant amounts of time; e.g. that edit would have taken me a couple of minutes of data entry, the prompt took a few seconds to write, and a few seconds to execute. I think it's likely that I'll keep using cloud agents for gnarly work, and local agents for the simpler things. That's not bad.\n\nPerhaps that's the sweet-spot.\n\nI don't really know what I want to get from this post, perhaps just to start a conversation.\n\n**Are you working on large projects with locally hosted models?**\n\n**How has your experience been?**\n\nIf I'm missing anything obvious, let me know.\n\nEdit: The markdown filenames attempted to be clickable links, edited to add a space to stop it.",

For what it's worth, I've been using KiloCode plugin for VScode, which seems to work pretty well with a variety of models.  It's not flawless, but at least I haven't had any unintended files overwritten.  My workflow is git-based, but it's still something I'm glad I haven't had to deal with while using kilocode.  I've been test-driving a variety of different local models.

GPT 20b you'll need like 4k context, which really limtis it's use. For anything you need to work on more amounts of data you'll need to go down to an 8b model or even 3b to get some more space for context as you don't have enough ram for a 15gb model and 32k parameters of context without crashing your OS.

You ABSOLUTELY can run qwen3,  deepseek, gemma3, I would say you'd get the most out of Qwen3-vl since it has vision, thinking and tool capabilities. \nThat said if you need one that things and orchestrates like gpt oss... I would absolutely recommend Nvidia Orchestrate 8b. That is a banger of a model for its size.",

Works as a lightweight wrapper around any Ollama call (or other providers in hybrid).\n\n**Free forever.

However, performance will be a limiting factor, and it will not be as fast as a dedicated multi-GPU setup. \n\nFeasibility and Performance\n\nThe \n\nAMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370\n\n uses unified memory, meaning the integrated GPU (iGPU) and NPU share the main system RAM. The primary limitation for running large models like a 70B LLM is memory capacity and bandwidth, not raw compute power. \n\n* **Memory Requirements**: A 70B model requires significant memory. In its original format, it could need over 80GB of VRAM or unified memory. However, using quantization (reducing the precision of the model's parameters, e.g., to 4-bit or 8-bit), the memory footprint can be reduced to around 40-56GB. Therefore, at least 64GB of system RAM is needed, with 96GB or 128GB being preferable for a smoother experience and larger context windows.\n* **Performance Expectations**: While the model can \"run,\" the speed will be slow compared to professional-grade hardware.\n   * One user successfully ran a quantized 80B model on an  [AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462826270682533,imageDocid:6622906445780665015,gpcid:1922910637295993356,headlineOfferDocid:11974420056489500570,catalogid:8464406605464093926,productDocid:3926129318797190370&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ-O7CvOGSAxVm1vACHRWwFL8Qxa4PegYIAQgFEAQ)  system with 96GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and achieved an inference speed of around **18 tokens per second** (tok/s) using the integrated graphics and `llama.cpp` optimizations.\n   * For comparison, high-end dedicated GPUs can achieve 60-100 tok/s on similar models. The  Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 's NPU, while powerful for its class (50 TOPS), is better suited for smaller 7B or 13B models and AI-specific tasks like noise reduction, rather than running a full 70B model entirely.\n* **Optimization**: Performance heavily relies on software optimization tools like `llama.cpp` and frameworks that leverage the integrated GPU (using Vulkan offloading) to manage the substantial memory demands efficiently. ",

          "text": "The multi-pass retrieval approach is solid in theory but it amplifies the data quality problem. If your corpus has noisy chunks from messy extraction, one bad retrieval in single-pass RAG becomes three or four bad retrievals in a reasoning loop. Each pass compounds the noise.\n\nThe accuracy lifts they claim probably come as much from the re-formulated queries as from the multi-pass approach itself. A decomposed question that targets specific fields (price, date, section heading) retrieves better than a vague semantic search, regardless of how many passes you do.\n\nI'd focus on the ingestion quality first. If your source data comes in as structured fields instead of raw markdown dumps, even single-pass RAG gets you most of the way there. The multi-pass stuff helps when the question genuinely requires combining info from multiple documents, but that's a smaller percentage of queries than people think.",
