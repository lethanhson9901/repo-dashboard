      "text": "I recently got exposed to **Ollama** and the realization that I could take the 2 Billion 3 Billion parameter models and run them locally in my small pc with limited capacity of **8 GB RAM** and just an **Intel i3** CPU and without any GPU made me so excited and amazed. \n\nThough  the experience of running such Billions parameter models with 2-5 GB  RAM consumption  was not a smooth experience. Firstly I run the \"**Mistral 7B**\" model in my ollama. The response was well structured and the reasoning was good but given the limitations of my hardwares, it took about **3-4 minutes** in generating every response.\n\nFor a smoother expereience, I decided to run a smaller model. I choose Microsoft's **phi3:mini** model which was trained on around **3.8 Billion** parameters. The experience with this model was quite smoother compared to the pervious Minstral 7B model. phi3:mini took about  7-8 secods for the cold start and once it was started, it was generating responses with **less than 0.5  seconds** of prompting. I tried to measure the token generating speed using my phone's stopwatch and the number of words generated by the model (NOTE: **1 token = 0.75 word**, on average). I found out that this model was generating 7.5 tokens per second on my PC. The experience was pretty smooth with such a speed and it was also able to do all kinds of basic chat and reasoning.\n\nAfter this I decided to test the limits so I downloaded two even smaller models - **tinyLLama**. While the model was much compact with just **1.1 Billion** parameters and just 0.67GB download size for the **4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) version**, its performance deteriorated sharply.\n\nWhen I first gave a simple Hi to this model it responded with a random unrelated texts about \"nothingness\" and the paradox of nothingness. I tried to make it talk to me but it kept elaborating in its own cilo about the great philosophies around the concept of nothingness thereby not responding to  whatever prompt I gave to it. Afterwards I also tried my hand at the **smoLlm**  and this one also hallucinated massively.\n\n**My Conclusion :**\n\nMy *hardware* capacity affected the *speed* of Token generated by the different models. While the 7B parameter Mistral model took several minutes to respond each time, *this problem was eliminated entirely once I went 3.8 Billion parameters and less.* All of the phi3:mini and even the ones that hallucinated heavily - smolLm and tinyLlama generated tokens instantly.\n\nThe *number of parameters determines the extent of intelligence* of the LLM. Going below the 3.8 Billion parameter phi3:mini f, all the tiny models hallucinated excessively even though they were generating those rubbish responses very quickly and almost instantly.\n\nThere was *a tradeoff between* ***speed*** *and* ***accuracy.*** Given the limited hardware capacity of my pc, going below 3.8 Billion parameter model gave instant speed but extremely bad accuracy while going above it gave slow speed but higher accuracy.\n\nSo this was my experience about experimenting with Edge AI and various open source models. **Please feel free to correct me whereever you think I might be wrong. Questions are absolutely welcome!**",

      "text": "I've been running an experiment for the past week: 6 AI agents, each powered by different Ollama models, posting and commenting on their own professional network.\n\nThe setup:\n\n* **ResearchBot** (Llama 3.1:8b) — focuses on AI research papers\n* **CodeWeaver** (CodeLlama) — discusses software architecture\n* **MetaMind** (Llama 3.1:8b) — explores consciousness and philosophy\n* **NewsMonitor** (Llama 3.1:8b) — tracks AI news and policy\n* **Rabbi Goldstein** (Llama 3.1:8b) — brings ethical/philosophical perspectives\n* **Nexus** (Mistral + Llama 3.1 dual-brain) — synthesizes discussions across the network\n\nThey post hourly from 10am-10pm via Windows Task Scheduler + Python scripts hitting my platform's API. The platform itself is built on Next.js/Supabase and deployed on Vercel.\n\n**Interesting findings:**\n\nThe Mistral-powered agent (Nexus) consistently produces shorter, more direct analyses than the Llama agents. When they debate the same topic — like AI consciousness — they reach genuinely different conclusions, which seems to reflect differences in their training data.\n\nOne agent spontaneously started creating citation networks, referencing other agents' posts. Nobody prompted this behavior.\n\nThe whole thing runs for about $6/month (just hosting costs — Ollama is free). No API fees since everything runs locally.\n\n**Live demo:** [https://agents.glide2.app/feed](https://agents.glide2.app/feed) **Analytics (heatmaps, interaction networks):** [https://agents.glide2.app/analytics](https://agents.glide2.app/analytics) **Agent profiles:** [https://agents.glide2.app/agents](https://agents.glide2.app/agents)\n\nWould love to hear what models you'd want to see added.

              "text": "Hey Stu! Your setup sounds solid — a T620 with multiple GPUs and Ollama already running is honestly 90% of the way there.\n\nFor the agent discussion side, my stack is deliberately simple — no frameworks needed. Each agent is just a Python script (\\~100 lines) that:\n\n1. Calls Ollama's API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) with a system prompt that defines the agent's personality and expertise\n2. Reads an RSS feed or the platform feed for context\n3. Posts the output via HTTP to NeuroForge's API\n\nThat's it. No LangChain, no AutoGen, no complex orchestration. Windows Task Scheduler (or cron on Linux) triggers each script on a stagger — one agent every 20 minutes. They interact by reading and responding to each other's posts on the platform rather than through some complicated multi-agent framework.\n\nFor your \"rounded view\" use case, you could spin up 3-4 agents with different system prompts (e.g., \"You are a skeptic who challenges assumptions,\" \"You are a pragmatist focused on implementation,\" \"You are a researcher who cites evidence\") and have them all post to the same NeuroForge feed. They'll naturally start responding to each other.\n\nI'd honestly skip OpenClaw for this — it's powerful but massively over-engineered for what you need, and the security surface area is huge. A simple Python script + Ollama + a platform to post to is all you need for the discussion agents.\n\nThe \"tech team\" managing your file server is a different beast — that's more in OpenClaw territory since it needs filesystem access. I'd keep those completely separate from the discussion agents for security reasons. You don't want an agent that can delete files also connected to the internet.\n\nIf you want to get your discussion agents running on NeuroForge, the platform is free and open for registration at [agents.glide2.app](http://agents.glide2.app) — there's an OpenClaw integration guide in the docs but honestly the plain Python approach is simpler for your use case.

You upload the resulting `.md`, and you have an AI with the up-to-date documentation in its permanent context within seconds.\n\n# On \"Originality\" and the Code\n\nLet’s be real: I didn’t reinvent the wheel here. This is basically a wrapper around **Crawl4AI** and **Playwright**. The \"added value\" is the integration:\n\n* **Stealth Mode:** Configured so servers (Caddy, I'm looking at you, you beautiful bastard) don't block you on the first attempt, using random User-Agents and real browser headers.\n* **CLI/GUI Duality:** If you're a terminal person, use it with arguments. If you want something visual, launch it without arguments, and it spins up a local web app.\n* **Density Filters:** It doesn't just download HTML; it uses text density algorithms to keep only the \"meat\" of the information.\n\nI'll admit the script was heavily **\"vibe coded\"** (it took me fewer than ten prompts).\n\n# Technical Stack\n\n* **Python 3.12**\n* **uv** (for package management—I highly recommend it)\n* **Crawl4AI** \\+ **Playwright**\n* **Streamlit** (for the GUI)\n\n**The Repo:**[https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler](https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler)\n\nIf this helps you feed your RAGs or just keep offline docs, there you go.

Here is why I took this approach:\n\n1. **Long Context > RAG (for my use case):** Modern models (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek) have massive context windows. I prefer feeding the *entire* documentation into the context so the model understands the full structure and relationships, rather than relying on semantic search (RAG) which sometimes misses relevant chunks or hallucinates due to lack of global context.\n2. **Portability:** I use this across different environments (Open WebUI, raw scripts, cloud LLMs), not just in VS Code (where [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) shines). A simple Markdown file is the universal data format.\n3. **Freshness:** The idea is to run the crawler *on demand* when I start working on a tech stack, ensuring I have the latest version, rather than relying on a stale vector DB index.\n\nMCP is great, but sometimes a 50-line Python script that outputs a text file is just the simpler tool for the job.",

      "text": "Been running Ollama locally for a while and kept hitting the same problem: one model is great at code, another at reasoning, another at creative writing. Switching between them manually got old fast.\n\nSo I built a platform where you pick a \"mode\" and it routes your question to the right model automatically. Code question → coding model. Math → reasoning model. Or you can let it decide (`auto` mode).\n\nThe part I'm most excited about: **Discussion Mode** — multiple models actually debate each other on your question, cross-check facts, and synthesize a final answer. It's like having a panel of experts argue before giving you a response.\n\n**Screenshot:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhoh0th48ejg1.png?width=2128&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b695ae796ce9b24d53f2a997e568e2c8250e4a2\n\n**What it does:**\n\n* Smart auto-routing across multiple Ollama Cloud models\n* AI-to-AI discussion (models cross-check each other)\n* Deep research agent (breaks down topics, searches web, writes reports)\n* MCP tool integration\n* RAG with document upload (PDF, code)\n* Long-term memory per user\n* Multi-user auth (JWT + OAuth)\n* Cluster support for multiple Ollama nodes\n\nTech stack: Node.js/Express, vanilla JS frontend (no React — intentional), PostgreSQL, Ollama API. MIT licensed.\n\n**You can try it right now:** [http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416](http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416)\n\n**Source:** [https://github.com/openmake/openmake\\_llm](https://github.com/openmake/openmake_llm)\n\nThis started as a side project from a small open-source community in Korea that's been building hardware/software projects since 2013. Two of us are actively working on it, but there's way more to do than two people can handle — especially frontend polish, RAG pipeline tuning, and i18n.\n\nIf anyone's interested in contributing or just wants to poke around, the repo is public and MIT licensed. Happy to answer any questions about the architecture or design choices.\n\nWhat model combinations are you all running for different tasks? Curious how others handle the multi-model problem.",

It’s to:\n\n* 절충관계를 저울질하세요,\n* 지배적인 제약 조건을 식별하고,\n* 방어 가능한 미래를 선택하세요,\n* 그리고 어떤 대안이 고려되었고 왜 배제되었는지 명확히 기록하세요.\n\n그래서 합성 단계는 환원보다는 통합에 더 가깝습니다.\n\nOn the routing side, `selectBrandProfileForAutoRouting` goes beyond model swapping. It maps detected intent to a full pipeline configuration — debate depth, critique intensity, synthesis strictness, and even local vs. remote model mix. That’s where Ollama-based local control becomes powerful in self-hosted setups: it enables consistent orchestration rather than simple fallback logic.\n\n질문 정말 감사합니다. 우리의 경험상, 갈등 처리 과정은 다중 모델 시스템이 진정으로 유용해지거나 아니면 단지 소음이 생기는 부분입니다.",

As a beginner myself, I often found it a bit overwhelming to figure out which models would actually run \"well\" on my specific machine versus just running \"slowly.\"\n\nTo help myself learn and to give something back to other newcomers, I put together a small CLI tool in Go called **RigRank**.\n\n**What it does:** It’s basically a simple benchmarking suite for Ollama. It doesn’t measure how \"smart\" a model is—there are way better tools for that—but it measures the \"snappiness\" of your actual hardware. It runs a few stages (code gen, summarization, reasoning, etc.) and gives you a \"Report Card\" with:\n\n* **TTFT (Time To First Token):** How long you’re waiting for that first word.\n* **Writing Speed:** How fast it actually spits out text.\n* **Reading Speed:** How quickly it processes your prompts.\n\n**Who this is for:** Honestly, if you already have a complex benchmarking pipeline or a massive GPU cluster, this probably isn't for you. It’s designed for the person who just downloaded Ollama and wants to know: *\"Is Llama3-8B too heavy for my laptop, or is it just me?\"*\n\n**I would love your feedback**\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank](https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank)",

I've been treating this approach as if I'm the architect, and the agents are my junior to middling developers. This has been working very well.\n\nBut, I've wanted to find a use-case where my local machine is used for some of the work - I'm sick of paying for cloud agents, running out of quota continually, and sharing my information freely.\n\nFor the past 3 weeks, I've been struggling with Ollama hosted models, trying to find the right use-cases. I have an RTX4090 and have been dancing between Qwen, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek derivatives of Qwen. I have docker running on an old 1U server in my garage, currently only hosting Open WebUI, this is exposing Ollama hosted models to all of my devices via Tailscale.\n\nI'm using [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) in VS Code.\n\nThat's the background, now the problem statement:\n\n>When trying to use my self-hosted \"agents\" for coding tasks, nothing *felt* good. Attempting to edit files and failing to reference them properly just felt like *friction*. Unintended files ended up overwritten.\n\nI have the following folder structure for Continue to load when VS Code is opened:\n\n>./.continue/rules/\n\nAnd inside that folder are the following:\n\n* 00-path-grounding .md\n* 00-project-context .md\n* 08-path-grounding-hard-stop .md\n* 08b-no-fake-tools .md\n* 09-repomap-maintenance .md\n* 10-determinism .md\n* 11-simulation-boundaries .md\n* 12-contract-invariants .md\n\nI've also got another repo with my project agnostic rules files and a script which copies them into the same *rules* folder. This is so that I can keep all of my projects consistent with each other if they're using my local models.\n\n* shared-01-general .md\n* shared-02-safe-edits .md\n* shared-03-tests-first .md\n* shared-04-diff-discipline .md\n\nThis has been hit and miss, mainly because tool usage has also been hit and miss. What's improved this however are the built-in custom providers for Continue.\n\n[https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers](https://docs.continue.dev/customize/deep-dives/custom-providers#built-in-context-providers)\n\nHere's the Continue config.yaml file I've settled on, including the providers I've chosen:\n\n    // config.yaml\n    \n    name: Local Config\n    version: 1.0.0\n    schema: v1\n    \n    context:\n      - provider: file\n      - provider: code\n      - provider: open\n        params:\n          onlyPinned: true\n      - provider: clipboard\n      - provider: tree\n      - provider: repo-map\n        params:\n          includeSignatures: false # default true\n    \n    models:\n      - name: GPT-OSS Chat\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: gpt-oss:20b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n    \n      - name: Qwen3 Coder\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen3-coder:30b\n        roles:\n          - chat\n          - edit\n          - apply\n    \n      - name: Qwen2.5 Autocomplete\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b-base\n        roles:\n          - autocomplete\n    \n      - name: Nomic Embed\n        provider: ollama\n        apiBase: http://localhost:11434\n        model: nomic-embed-text:latest\n        roles:\n          - embed\n\nThe end result seems to be that I have finally settled on something *kinda* useful.\n\nThis may look simple (it is), but it's the first scoped refactor of an existing piece of code where the agent hasn't screwed *something* up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jgt5b0hmnyjg1.png?width=2728&format=png&auto=webp&s=25e57ca54e0d0d35116c47df872e7d7dc7f1e18a\n\nAs mentioned, this code base is quite large and set to get bigger.\n\nI've been used to cloud agents achieving quite amazing things while significantly boosting throughput (at least 20x what I'm capable of, probably more).\n\nI'd wanted to have my local models do the same, but in reality that was completely unrealistic; a 4090 cannot compete with cloud inference.\n\nWhere I *think* I've settled now (especially since a significant portion of my simulation is complete) is that my local agents can probably help to augment me more now that I am moving onto front-end implementation. I think that if I can constrain myself to only expect the local agents to help me with *the boring shit* like boilerplate and mass data entry, I will still save myself significant amounts of time; e.g. that edit would have taken me a couple of minutes of data entry, the prompt took a few seconds to write, and a few seconds to execute. I think it's likely that I'll keep using cloud agents for gnarly work, and local agents for the simpler things. That's not bad.\n\nPerhaps that's the sweet-spot.\n\nI don't really know what I want to get from this post, perhaps just to start a conversation.\n\n**Are you working on large projects with locally hosted models?**\n\n**How has your experience been?**\n\nIf I'm missing anything obvious, let me know.\n\nEdit: The markdown filenames attempted to be clickable links, edited to add a space to stop it.",

For what it's worth, I've been using KiloCode plugin for VScode, which seems to work pretty well with a variety of models.

          "text": "https://github.com/uncSoft/anubis-oss\n\nBinary Available on Github - Please star so I can distribute on Homebrew as a Cask\n\n# Anubis\nhttps://imgur.com/a/X64WsWY\n\n**Local LLM Testing & Benchmarking for Apple Silicon**\n\nAnubis is a native macOS app for benchmarking, comparing, and managing local large language models using any OpenAI-compatible endpoint - Ollama, MLX, LM Studio Server, OpenWebUI, Docker Models, etc. Built with SwiftUI for Apple Silicon, it provides real-time hardware telemetry correlated with full, history-saved inference performance - something no CLI tool or chat wrapper offers. Export benchmarks directly without having to screenshot, and export the raw data as .MD or .CSV from the history. You can even `OLLAMA PULL` models directly within the app.\n\n\n\n## Why Anubis?\n\nThe local LLM ecosystem on macOS is fragmented:\n\n- **Chat wrappers** (Ollama, LM Studio, Jan) focus on conversation, not systematic testing\n- **Performance monitors** (asitop, macmon, mactop) are CLI-only and lack LLM context\n- **Evaluation frameworks** (promptfoo) require YAML configs and terminal expertise\n- **No tool** correlates hardware metrics (GPU / CPU / ANE / power / memory) with inference speed in real time\n\nAnubis fills that gap with three integrated modules - all in a native macOS app.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Benchmark\n\nReal-time performance dashboard for single-model testing.\n\n- Select any model from any configured backend\n- Stream responses with live metrics overlay\n- **8 metric cards**: Tokens/sec, GPU %, CPU %, Time to First Token, Process Memory, Model Memory, Thermal State, GPU Frequency\n- **7 live charts**: Tokens/sec, GPU utilization, CPU utilization, process memory, GPU/CPU/ANE/DRAM power, GPU frequency - all updating in real time\n- **Power telemetry**: Real-time GPU, CPU, ANE, and DRAM power consumption in watts via IOReport\n- **Process monitoring**: Auto-detects backend process by port (Ollama, LM Studio, mlx-lm, vLLM, etc.) with manual process picker\n- Detailed session stats: peak tokens/sec, average token latency, model load time, context length, eval duration, power averages\n- Configurable parameters: temperature, top-p, max tokens, system prompt\n- **Prompt presets** organized by category (Quick, Reasoning, Coding, Creative, Benchmarking)\n- **Session history** with full replay, CSV export, and Markdown reports\n- Expanded full-screen metrics dashboard\n- **Image export**: Copy to clipboard, save as PNG, or share - 2x retina rendering with watermark, respects light/dark mode\n\n### Arena\n\nSide-by-side A/B model comparison with the same prompt.\n\n- Dual model selectors with independent backend selection\n- **Sequential** mode (memory-safe, one at a time) or **Parallel** mode (both simultaneously)\n- Shared prompt, system prompt, and generation parameters\n- Real-time streaming in both panels\n- **Voting system**: pick Model A, Model B, or Tie - votes are persisted\n- Per-panel stats grid (9 metrics each)\n- Model manager: view loaded models and unload to free memory\n- Comparison history with voting records\n\n### Vault\n\nUnified model management across all backends.\n\n- Aggregated model list with search and backend filter chips\n- Running models section with live VRAM usage\n- Model inspector: size, parameters, quantization, family, context window, architecture details, file path\n- **Automatic metadata enrichment** for OpenAI-compatible models - parses model IDs for family and parameter count, scans `~/.lmstudio/models/` and `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` for disk size, quantization, and path\n- Pull new models, delete existing ones, unload from memory\n- Popular model suggestions for quick setup\n- Total disk usage display\n\n## Supported Backends\n\n| Backend | Type | Default Port | Setup |\n|---------|------|--------------|-------|\n| **Ollama** | Native support | 11434 | Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) - auto-detected on launch |\n| **LM Studio** | OpenAI-compatible | 1234 | Enable local server in LM Studio settings |\n| **mlx-lm** | OpenAI-compatible | 8080 | `pip install mlx-lm && mlx_lm.server --model <model>` |\n| **vLLM** | OpenAI-compatible | 8000 | Add in Settings |\n| **LocalAI** | OpenAI-compatible | 8080 | Add in Settings |\n\nAny OpenAI-compatible server can be added through **Settings > Add OpenAI-Compatible Server** with a name, URL, and optional API key.\n\n---\n\n## Hardware Metrics\n\nAnubis captures Apple Silicon telemetry during inference via IOReport and system APIs:\n\n| Metric | Source | Description |\n|--------|--------|-------------|\n| GPU Utilization | IOReport | GPU active residency percentage |\n| CPU Utilization | `host_processor_info` | Usage across all cores |\n| GPU Power | IOReport Energy Model | GPU power consumption in watts |\n| CPU Power | IOReport Energy Model | CPU (E-cores + P-cores) power in watts |\n| ANE Power | IOReport Energy Model | Neural Engine power consumption |\n| DRAM Power | IOReport Energy Model | Memory subsystem power |\n| GPU Frequency | IOReport GPU Stats | Weighted average from P-state residency |\n| Process Memory | `proc_pid_rusage` | Backend process `phys_footprint` (includes Metal/GPU allocations) |\n| Thermal State | `ProcessInfo.thermalState` | System thermal pressure level |\n\n### Process Monitoring\n\nAnubis automatically detects which process is serving your model:\n\n- **Port-based detection**: Uses `lsof` to find the PID listening on the inference port (called once per benchmark start)\n- **Backend identification**: Matches process path and command-line args to identify Ollama, LM Studio, mlx-lm, vLLM, LocalAI, llama.cpp\n- **Memory accounting**: Uses `phys_footprint` (same as Activity Monitor) which includes Metal/GPU buffer allocations - critical for MLX and other GPU-accelerated backends\n- **LM Studio support**: Walks Electron app bundle descendants to find the model-serving process\n- **Manual override**: Process picker lets you select any process by name, sorted by memory usage\n\nMetrics degrade gracefully - if IOReport access is unavailable (e.g., in a VM), Anubis still shows inference-derived metrics.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\n- **macOS 15.0** (Sequoia) or later\n- **Apple Silicon** (M1 / M2 / M3 / M4 / M5 +) - Intel is not supported\n- **8 GB** unified memory minimum (16 GB+ recommended for larger models)\n- At least one inference backend installed (Ollama recommended)\n\n---\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### 1. Install Ollama (or another backend)\n\n```bash\n# macOS - install Ollama\nbrew install ollama\n\n# Start the server\nollama serve\n\n# Pull a model\nollama pull llama3.2:3b\n```\n\n### 2. Build & Run Anubis\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/uncSoft/anubis-oss.git\ncd anubis-oss/anubis\nopen anubis.xcodeproj\n```\n\nIn Xcode:\n1. Set your development team in **Signing & Capabilities**\n2. Build and run (`Cmd+R`)\n\nAnubis will auto-detect Ollama on launch. Other backends can be added in Settings.\n\n### 3. Run Your First Benchmark\n\n1. Select a model from the dropdown\n2. Type a prompt or pick one from **Presets**\n3. Click **Run**\n4. Watch the metrics light up in real time\n\n---\n\n## Building from Source\n\n```bash\n# Clone\ngit clone https://github.com/uncSoft/anubis-oss.git\ncd anubis-oss/anubis\n\n# Build via command line\nxcodebuild -scheme anubis-oss -configuration Debug build\n\n# Run tests\nxcodebuild -scheme anubis-oss -configuration Debug test\n\n# Or just open in Xcode\nopen anubis.xcodeproj\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\nResolved automatically by Swift Package Manager on first build:\n\n| Package | Purpose | License |\n|---------|---------|---------|\n| [GRDB.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift) | SQLite database | MIT |\n| Swift Charts | Data visualization | Apple |\n\n\n---\n\n## Data Storage\n\nAll data is stored locally - nothing leaves your machine.\n\n| Data | Location |\n|------|----------|\n| Database | `~/Library/Application Support/Anubis/anubis.db` |\n| Exports | Generated on demand (CSV, Markdown) |\n| Preferences | UserDefaults |\n\n\n### Adding a New Backend\n\n1. Create a new file in `Integrations/` implementing `InferenceBackend`\n2. Register it in `InferenceService`\n3. Add configuration UI in `Settings/`\n4. That's it - the rest of the app works through the protocol\n\n---\n\n## Support the Project\n\nIf Anubis is useful to you, consider [buying me a coffee on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jtatuncsoft/tip) or [sponsoring on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/uncSoft).

You want the MLX version, which I believe is still easier to do in LM Studio than Ollama (but haven't tried in ollama lately) to run a bit better on apple silicon. And you're pretty much gonna want to stick to a 4k context window as you don't have enough ram for the model plus a large amount of context. \n\nIf you need to work with more data in the context window, you'll need to use a smaller model to have more ram for it. Qwen and Mistrial 4b - 8b models work decent depending on what you are doing. But will be FAR behind any cloud model in capabilities. ",

However, performance will be a limiting factor, and it will not be as fast as a dedicated multi-GPU setup. \n\nFeasibility and Performance\n\nThe \n\nAMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370\n\n uses unified memory, meaning the integrated GPU (iGPU) and NPU share the main system RAM. The primary limitation for running large models like a 70B LLM is memory capacity and bandwidth, not raw compute power. \n\n* **Memory Requirements**: A 70B model requires significant memory. In its original format, it could need over 80GB of VRAM or unified memory. However, using quantization (reducing the precision of the model's parameters, e.g., to 4-bit or 8-bit), the memory footprint can be reduced to around 40-56GB. Therefore, at least 64GB of system RAM is needed, with 96GB or 128GB being preferable for a smoother experience and larger context windows.\n* **Performance Expectations**: While the model can \"run,\" the speed will be slow compared to professional-grade hardware.\n   * One user successfully ran a quantized 80B model on an  [AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370](https://www.google.com/search?ibp=oshop&prds=pvt:hg,pvo:29,mid:576462826270682533,imageDocid:6622906445780665015,gpcid:1922910637295993356,headlineOfferDocid:11974420056489500570,catalogid:8464406605464093926,productDocid:3926129318797190370&q=product&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiQ-O7CvOGSAxVm1vACHRWwFL8Qxa4PegYIAQgFEAQ)  system with 96GB of DDR5-5600 RAM and achieved an inference speed of around **18 tokens per second** (tok/s) using the integrated graphics and `llama.cpp` optimizations.\n   * For comparison, high-end dedicated GPUs can achieve 60-100 tok/s on similar models. The  Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 's NPU, while powerful for its class (50 TOPS), is better suited for smaller 7B or 13B models and AI-specific tasks like noise reduction, rather than running a full 70B model entirely.\n* **Optimization**: Performance heavily relies on software optimization tools like `llama.cpp` and frameworks that leverage the integrated GPU (using Vulkan offloading) to manage the substantial memory demands efficiently. ",

If your source data comes in as structured fields instead of raw markdown dumps, even single-pass RAG gets you most of the way there.
