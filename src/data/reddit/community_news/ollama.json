      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m excited to share something we’ve been building for the past 6 months, a **fully open-source Enterprise Search Platform** designed to bring powerful Enterprise Search to every team, without vendor lock-in. The platform brings all your business data together and makes it searchable. It connects with apps like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Outlook, SharePoint, Dropbox, Local file uploads and more. You can deploy it and run it with just one docker compose command.\n\nYou can run the full platform locally. Recently, one of our users tried **qwen3-vl:8b (16 FP)** with **Ollama** and got very good results.\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\nAt the core, the system uses an **Agentic Graph RAG approach**, where retrieval is guided by an enterprise knowledge graph and reasoning agents. Instead of treating documents as flat text, agents reason over relationships between users, teams, entities, documents, and permissions, allowing more accurate, explainable, and permission-aware answers.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of documents, user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Visual Citations for every answer\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 40+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck it out and share your thoughts or feedback. Your feedback is immensely valuable and is much appreciated:  \n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nDemo Video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8)",

          "text": "> What’s the most idiot proof way to set this up?\n\nDepends on the idiot.\n\nOn Linux, this idiot runs Ollama in a container, and Open WebUI in another container, pointing at Ollama. I even have two machines running Ollama, with very different amounts of RAM, and so different models saved; Open WebUI uses both as backends (and runs on a third machine because that's how my home network rolls).\n\nBut you could definitely do it all on one machine with two containers.\n\nI have shell scripts that I run and just pull the latest images and re-launch the containers. Upgrades are no-brainers this way. This is the main reason why I run Ollama in Docker. If I reboot the machine, the containers start again automatically. This is the Ollama update script (the one for Open WebUI is similar):\n\n    docker stop ollama && echo \"stopped the ollama container\" || echo \"could not stop the ollama container\"\n    docker rm ollama && echo \"removed the ollama container\" || echo \"could not remove the ollama container\"\n    docker pull ollama/ollama:latest\n    \n    # the host part is not really needed for Ollama\n    docker run -d --restart always \\\n    \t--gpus=all \\\n    \t-p 11434:11434 \\\n    \t--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n    \t-v ollama:/root/.ollama \\\n    \t--name ollama \\\n    \tollama/ollama:latest\n    \n    (\n    \tsleep 1\n    \techo; echo\n    \tdocker logs -f ollama &\n    \tDOCKER_LOGS_PID=$!\n    \tsleep 30\n    \tkill $DOCKER_LOGS_PID\n    ) &\n\nYou need to install the NVIDIA Docker compatibility layer, for containers to access the GPU. On Ubuntu, that's a package called `nvidia-container-toolkit`.\n\nYou can even invoke the `ollama` command from the terminal as usual, even when it runs in a container. But you do have to distinguish between interactive and non-interactive sessions, so I have this in `~/.bash_aliases` :\n\n    # shell functions\n    ollama() {\n        if [ -t 0 ]; then\n    \t# this is a terminal, allocate a pseudo-TTY\n            docker exec -it ollama ollama \"$@\"\n        else\n    \t# this is not a terminal, do not allocate a pseudo-TTY\n            docker exec -i ollama ollama \"$@\"\n        fi\n    }\n\nAnd that allows me to invoke the `ollama` command as if it were running on the host.\n\nCheck the status of your containers with `docker ps -a`.",

Keep in mind, this is the Open WebUI version without GPU enabled (GPU access is only enabled for Ollama); you may prefer otherwise.\n\n`host.docker.internal` is the host. You will use this in the Open WebUI settings if Ollama runs on the same machine. Otherwise it's not important.\n\nBoth update scripts simply restart the containers if there's nothing to update. They are also \"installer\" scripts. In other words, idiot-proof. I like it that way.",

[https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF)\n\nFor dense models, something like Llama 3.1 7B would run pretty well on that setup. You'd want to find a reasonable quantization -- something [https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct)\n\nYou could probably squeeze a dense model up to about 12-13B on there, although I haven't run models that small for a while so I don't have any good recommendations in that size range. \n\n\\- You can't run, well, most things. You're very severely constrained by VRAM when running LLMs. The second you exceed VRAM, it starts to offload to system RAM, and system RAM is much slower. No models you are capable of running will be anywhere near as \"smart\" as ChatGPT, and you won't be able to get anything near that level without spending tens of thousands of dollars on hardware. For dense models like Llama, the maximum size you can run is roughly \"your total VRAM minus \\~1-2 GB\". For MoE models like GPT-OSS, the maximum size you can run is roughly \"your total system RAM minus 1-2 GB\". \n\n\\- Web searching and similar can be accomplished via a web search MCP tool, but the model has to understand how to do tool calling -- GPT-OSS definitely can. MCP basically exposes an external tool to an LLM with instructions on how to use it, and the LLM can choose how and when to use the tool. There are a few web search MCP tools out there, but I haven't used MCP in conjunction with Ollama so I'll leave others to explain how to set up.",

          "text": "> Which models run well on this setup\n\n> What I can’t run\n\nIt's mostly about the different kinds of RAM.\n\nA model that can fit in the VRAM of your GPU will always run fast. On the model page, look at the Size column. If it's less than the VRAM, it will stay in the VRAM.\n\nhttps://ollama.com/library/gemma3\n\nThere are some tricks you could do with offloading parts of the model to system RAM, but a model will always run more slowly that way, all else being equal.\n\nSo, look at any model family you like, and pick the versions with a Size less than 10 GB. E.g. gemma3:12b will fit in your VRAM.\n\nScript to download and update models:\n\n    ollama pull gemma3:12b\n    ollama pull llama3.1:8b\n    ollama pull ministral-3:14b\n    ollama pull qwen3:14b\n\nIt's worth re-running it once every few weeks, because they sometimes update existing models.\n\n> How close local models can get to ChatGPT\n\nRigorous performance evaluations and benchmarking are notoriously difficult with LLMs. So the best answer is: they're not quite as smart as frontier models, but they can do stuff.\n\n> If things like web search, fact-checking, or up-to-date info are possible locally (or any workarounds)\n\nThere are many ways to skin this cat. Here's one:\n\nAssuming your OS is Windows, you could run Open WebUI in Docker, and enable web search and other tools.\n\n- install Docker Desktop\n- configure owui to run in a container in Docker\n- point it at Ollama\n- play with web search settings, etc.\n\nScript to download, install, and update owui (re-running it once in a while will update the image):\n\n    docker stop open-webui\n    docker rm open-webui\n    docker pull ghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n\nScript to run owui:\n\n    docker run -it --rm -p 3000:8080 \\\n    \t--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n    \t-v open-webui:/app/backend/data \\\n    \t--name open-webui \\\n    \tghcr.io/open-webui/open-webui:main\n\nIf that's a .bat script then replace \\ with ^\n\nIf that's a bash script in WSL then it's good to go.\n\nOllama will be available to Open WebUI as `host.docker.internal` on port 11434.\n\nYou will browse to Open WebUI at http://localhost:3000/\n\nI prefer to invoke owui from a script when I need it. Running containers as services in Docker Desktop is kind of janky.",

Iterating with the model helped surface bad assumptions before I committed to an approach. They’re especially good at starting broad and narrowing down if you keep the conversation going so context builds up.\n\nWhen I add new features now, I don’t explain my app’s architecture anymore. I just link the relevant GitHub repos so the model can see how things are structured. That alone cut feature dev time from weeks to about a day in one case.\n\nI’m not saying prompt engineering is useless, just that for most practical work, context, iteration, and model choice mattered more for me.\n\nCurious how others here approach this.

We have many, many more tools available to us now to set a meaningful foundation for the model to use in generating output.\n\nIf you give the model tons of \\_really good\\_ information in  the codebase, supporting documents, etc etc etc, the user prompt becomes less and less critical.\n\nThe illustration I use at work is to imagine a random stranger comes up at you with a pile of papers, tells you to summarize the data therein for them, and, if you do a good job, you get $1M.  Imagine how you the quality of your product improves if the data has good labels... or if there's a previous report drawing on similar data that's there as an example. Or if the person also tells you what industry they're in.  Or if they tell you to \"imagine you're a customer service manager\" or whatever.\n\nEach little bit of information available improves your output.  The prompt is vital if that's all you give the model.  But context is \\_everything\\_.",

      "text": "RAG is the standard way to connect documents to LLMs. Most people building RAGs know the steps by now: parse documents, chunk them, embed, store vectors, retrieve at query time. But something different happens when you're building systems that act rather than answer.\n\n### The RAG mental model\n\nRAG preprocessing optimizes for retrieval. Someone asks a question, you find relevant chunks, you synthesize an answer. The whole pipeline is designed around that interaction pattern.\n\nThe work happens before anyone asks anything. Documents get parsed into text, extracting content from PDFs, Word docs, HTML, whatever format you're working with. Then chunking splits that text into pieces sized for context windows. You choose a strategy based on your content: split on paragraphs, headings, or fixed token counts. Overlap between chunks preserves context across boundaries. Finally, embedding converts each chunk into a vector where similar meanings cluster together. \"The contract expires in December\" ends up near \"Agreement termination date: 12/31/2024\" even though they share few words. That's what makes semantic search work.\n\nRetrieval is similarity search over those vectors. Query comes in, gets embedded, you find the nearest chunks in vector space. For Q&A, this works well. You ask a question, the system finds relevant passages, an LLM synthesizes an answer. The whole architecture assumes a query-response pattern.\n\nThe requirements shift when you're building systems that act instead of answer.\n\n### What agentic actually needs\n\nConsider a contract monitoring system. It tracks obligations across hundreds of agreements: Example Bank owes a quarterly audit report by the 15th, so the system sends a reminder on the 10th, flags it as overdue on the 16th, and escalates to legal on the 20th. The system doesn't just find text about deadlines. It acts on them.\n\nThat requires something different at the data layer. The system needs to understand that Party A owes Party B deliverable X by date Y under condition Z. And it needs to connect those facts across documents. Not just find text about obligations, but actually know what's owed to whom and when.\n\nThe preprocessing has to pull out that structure, not just preserve text for later search. You're not chunking paragraphs. You're turning \"Example Bank shall submit quarterly compliance reports within 15 days of quarter end\" into data you can query: party, obligation type, deadline, conditions. Think rows in a database, not passages in a search index.\n\n### Two parallel paths\n\nThe architecture ends up looking completely different.\n\nRAG has a linear pipeline. Documents go in, chunking happens, embeddings get created, vectors get stored. At query time, search, retrieve, generate.\n\nAgentic systems need two tracks running in parallel. The main one pulls structured data out of documents. An LLM reads each contract, extracts the obligations, parties, dates, and conditions, and writes them to a graph database. Why a graph? Because you're not just storing isolated facts, you're storing how they connect. Example Bank owes a report. That report is due quarterly. The obligation comes from Section 4.2 of Contract #1847. Those connections between entities are what graph databases are built for. This is what powers the actual monitoring.\n\nBut you still need embeddings. Just for different reasons.\n\nThe second track catches what extraction misses. Sometimes \"the Lender\" in paragraph 12 needs to connect to \"Example Bank\" from paragraph 3. Sometimes you don't know what patterns matter until you see them repeated across documents. The vector search helps you find connections that weren't obvious enough to extract upfront.\n\nSo you end up with two databases working together. The graph database stores entities and their relationships: who owes what to whom by when. The vector database helps you find things you didn't know to look for.\n\nI wrote the rest on my [blog](https://nickrichu.me/posts/the-preprocessing-gap-between-rag-and-agentic).",

      "text": "Hi everyone\n\nI am new in the world of Ollama so pardon me if this may sound like a stupid question. I am transitioning from GPT4All where when I make a request via API I can see in real time On the desktop app (on the server chat tab) The incoming request, the model thinking and the model generating a response. This was so great in debugging but GPT4All was slow for me so a colleague suggested Ollama and I can see much improvements in speed. I am currently integrating a Laravel App with Ollama and sending various request to the model and I wish I can be able to see the request and response in real time in Ollama just like I did in GPT4All Desktop App, so my question is whether or not this is possible? If it is then how can I go about configuring it?\n\nif it helps I am on Windows and this is for my local development.\n\nThank you in advance, your input will be highly appreciated.",
