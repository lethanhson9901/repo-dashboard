      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI’m excited to share something we’ve been building for the past 6 months, a **fully open-source Enterprise Search Platform** designed to bring powerful Enterprise Search to every team, without vendor lock-in. The platform brings all your business data together and makes it searchable. It connects with apps like Google Drive, Gmail, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira, Outlook, SharePoint, Dropbox, Local file uploads and more. You can deploy it and run it with just one docker compose command.\n\nYou can run the full platform locally. Recently, one of our users tried **qwen3-vl:8b (16 FP)** with **Ollama** and got very good results.\n\nThe entire system is built on a **fully event-streaming architecture powered by Kafka**, making indexing and retrieval scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time across large volumes of data.\n\nAt the core, the system uses an **Agentic Graph RAG approach**, where retrieval is guided by an enterprise knowledge graph and reasoning agents. Instead of treating documents as flat text, agents reason over relationships between users, teams, entities, documents, and permissions, allowing more accurate, explainable, and permission-aware answers.\n\n**Key features**\n\n* Deep understanding of documents, user, organization and teams with enterprise knowledge graph\n* Connect to any AI model of your choice including OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, or Ollama\n* Use any provider that supports OpenAI compatible endpoints\n* Choose from 1,000+ embedding models\n* Visual Citations for every answer\n* Vision-Language Models and OCR for visual or scanned docs\n* Login with Google, Microsoft, OAuth, or SSO\n* Rich REST APIs for developers\n* All major file types support including pdfs with images, diagrams and charts\n* Agent Builder - Perform actions like Sending mails, Schedule Meetings, etc along with Search, Deep research, Internet search and more\n* Reasoning Agent that plans before executing tasks\n* 40+ Connectors allowing you to connect to your entire business apps\n\nCheck it out and share your thoughts or feedback. Your feedback is immensely valuable and is much appreciated:  \n[https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai](https://github.com/pipeshub-ai/pipeshub-ai)\n\nDemo Video:  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA9m3pwOgz8)",

          "text": "> What’s the most idiot proof way to set this up?\n\nDepends on the idiot.\n\nOn Linux, this idiot runs Ollama in a container, and Open WebUI in another container, pointing at Ollama. I even have two machines running Ollama, with very different amounts of RAM, and so different models saved; Open WebUI uses both as backends (and runs on a third machine because that's how my home network rolls).\n\nBut you could definitely do it all on one machine with two containers.\n\nI have shell scripts that I run and just pull the latest images and re-launch the containers. Upgrades are no-brainers this way. This is the main reason why I run Ollama in Docker. If I reboot the machine, the containers start again automatically. This is the Ollama update script (the one for Open WebUI is similar):\n\n    docker stop ollama && echo \"stopped the ollama container\" || echo \"could not stop the ollama container\"\n    docker rm ollama && echo \"removed the ollama container\" || echo \"could not remove the ollama container\"\n    docker pull ollama/ollama:latest\n    \n    # the host part is not really needed for Ollama\n    docker run -d --restart always \\\n    \t--gpus=all \\\n    \t-p 11434:11434 \\\n    \t--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n    \t-v ollama:/root/.ollama \\\n    \t--name ollama \\\n    \tollama/ollama:latest\n    \n    (\n    \tsleep 1\n    \techo; echo\n    \tdocker logs -f ollama &\n    \tDOCKER_LOGS_PID=$!\n    \tsleep 30\n    \tkill $DOCKER_LOGS_PID\n    ) &\n\nYou need to install the NVIDIA Docker compatibility layer, for containers to access the GPU. On Ubuntu, that's a package called `nvidia-container-toolkit`.\n\nYou can even invoke the `ollama` command from the terminal as usual, even when it runs in a container. But you do have to distinguish between interactive and non-interactive sessions, so I have this in `~/.bash_aliases` :\n\n    # shell functions\n    ollama() {\n        if [ -t 0 ]; then\n    \t# this is a terminal, allocate a pseudo-TTY\n            docker exec -it ollama ollama \"$@\"\n        else\n    \t# this is not a terminal, do not allocate a pseudo-TTY\n            docker exec -i ollama ollama \"$@\"\n        fi\n    }\n\nAnd that allows me to invoke the `ollama` command as if it were running on the host.\n\nCheck the status of your containers with `docker ps -a`.",

Keep in mind, this is the Open WebUI version without GPU enabled (GPU access is only enabled for Ollama); you may prefer otherwise.\n\n`host.docker.internal` is the host. You will use this in the Open WebUI settings if Ollama runs on the same machine. Otherwise it's not important.\n\nBoth update scripts simply restart the containers if there's nothing to update. They are also \"installer\" scripts. In other words, idiot-proof. I like it that way.",

Iterating with the model helped surface bad assumptions before I committed to an approach. They’re especially good at starting broad and narrowing down if you keep the conversation going so context builds up.\n\nWhen I add new features now, I don’t explain my app’s architecture anymore. I just link the relevant GitHub repos so the model can see how things are structured. That alone cut feature dev time from weeks to about a day in one case.\n\nI’m not saying prompt engineering is useless, just that for most practical work, context, iteration, and model choice mattered more for me.\n\nCurious how others here approach this. Has prompt engineering been critical for you, or have you seen similar results?\n\n(I wrote up the full experience here if anyone wants more detail: [https://xthebuilder.github.io](https://xthebuilder.github.io))\n",

We have many, many more tools available to us now to set a meaningful foundation for the model to use in generating output.\n\nIf you give the model tons of \\_really good\\_ information in  the codebase, supporting documents, etc etc etc, the user prompt becomes less and less critical.\n\nThe illustration I use at work is to imagine a random stranger comes up at you with a pile of papers, tells you to summarize the data therein for them, and, if you do a good job, you get $1M.  Imagine how you the quality of your product improves if the data has good labels... or if there's a previous report drawing on similar data that's there as an example. Or if the person also tells you what industry they're in.  Or if they tell you to \"imagine you're a customer service manager\" or whatever.\n\nEach little bit of information available improves your output.  The prompt is vital if that's all you give the model.  But context is \\_everything\\_.",

      "text": "RAG is the standard way to connect documents to LLMs. Most people building RAGs know the steps by now: parse documents, chunk them, embed, store vectors, retrieve at query time. But something different happens when you're building systems that act rather than answer.\n\n### The RAG mental model\n\nRAG preprocessing optimizes for retrieval. Someone asks a question, you find relevant chunks, you synthesize an answer. The whole pipeline is designed around that interaction pattern.\n\nThe work happens before anyone asks anything. Documents get parsed into text, extracting content from PDFs, Word docs, HTML, whatever format you're working with. Then chunking splits that text into pieces sized for context windows. You choose a strategy based on your content: split on paragraphs, headings, or fixed token counts. Overlap between chunks preserves context across boundaries. Finally, embedding converts each chunk into a vector where similar meanings cluster together. \"The contract expires in December\" ends up near \"Agreement termination date: 12/31/2024\" even though they share few words. That's what makes semantic search work.\n\nRetrieval is similarity search over those vectors. Query comes in, gets embedded, you find the nearest chunks in vector space. For Q&A, this works well. You ask a question, the system finds relevant passages, an LLM synthesizes an answer. The whole architecture assumes a query-response pattern.\n\nThe requirements shift when you're building systems that act instead of answer.\n\n### What agentic actually needs\n\nConsider a contract monitoring system. It tracks obligations across hundreds of agreements: Example Bank owes a quarterly audit report by the 15th, so the system sends a reminder on the 10th, flags it as overdue on the 16th, and escalates to legal on the 20th. The system doesn't just find text about deadlines. It acts on them.\n\nThat requires something different at the data layer. The system needs to understand that Party A owes Party B deliverable X by date Y under condition Z. And it needs to connect those facts across documents. Not just find text about obligations, but actually know what's owed to whom and when.\n\nThe preprocessing has to pull out that structure, not just preserve text for later search. You're not chunking paragraphs. You're turning \"Example Bank shall submit quarterly compliance reports within 15 days of quarter end\" into data you can query: party, obligation type, deadline, conditions. Think rows in a database, not passages in a search index.\n\n### Two parallel paths\n\nThe architecture ends up looking completely different.\n\nRAG has a linear pipeline. Documents go in, chunking happens, embeddings get created, vectors get stored. At query time, search, retrieve, generate.\n\nAgentic systems need two tracks running in parallel. The main one pulls structured data out of documents. An LLM reads each contract, extracts the obligations, parties, dates, and conditions, and writes them to a graph database. Why a graph? Because you're not just storing isolated facts, you're storing how they connect. Example Bank owes a report. That report is due quarterly. The obligation comes from Section 4.2 of Contract #1847. Those connections between entities are what graph databases are built for. This is what powers the actual monitoring.\n\nBut you still need embeddings. Just for different reasons.\n\nThe second track catches what extraction misses. Sometimes \"the Lender\" in paragraph 12 needs to connect to \"Example Bank\" from paragraph 3. Sometimes you don't know what patterns matter until you see them repeated across documents. The vector search helps you find connections that weren't obvious enough to extract upfront.\n\nSo you end up with two databases working together. The graph database stores entities and their relationships: who owes what to whom by when. The vector database helps you find things you didn't know to look for.\n\nI wrote the rest on my [blog](https://nickrichu.me/posts/the-preprocessing-gap-between-rag-and-agentic).",

It's already in the engine and working, but I have some questions on what model I should use, and any tips in general for the experiments I want to do. I understand most LLMs running locally will take a while to think and generate a response, but for now let's ignore that.\n\n1. NPC Chat with commands: I know most people have tried doing NPC chatbots in engines, but I was thinking I could try to spice that up by integrating commands on it. Like the LLM would have a list of commands, given by me, that it could use contextually, like /laugh /cry /givePlayer(item), things like that. And I can make a system that parses the string and extracts/executes the commands. I attempted this one time, not in engine, just by using regular chat GPT and it would eventually come up with its own commands that were not stipulated by me. How to avoid that? Is there a model I should use for that?\n2. NPC consistency in character. I also tried one time to keep chat GPT in character, a peasant from the medieval ages, but I would ask about modern events like COVID and it would eventually break and talk about it as if he knew what it was.\n3. NPC Memory. What if I wanted to have NPCs remember things they have witnessed? I imagine I should make a log system that keeps every action done to that npc (NPC was hit by Player. NPC killed bandit. NPC found 1 gold etc) and then adding it to the beggining of the prompt as a little memory. Is that enough?\n4. Can I reliably limit the response length or is it finicky? Like, setting a limit of how many words per response \n5. Is there a way to guarantee responses are always in character? Because sometimes some of the LLMs will say \"I cannot answer to things related to that\" and that would be a big immersion breaker \n\nAnd another general question, is there a way to train certain models to get them used to a certani context? like i said, using commands I create in my game, or training them to act like a specific type of character etc.\n\nAgain, other than my experiments with just the chat GPT window, I am pretty new to this. If you have advice on what models to use or best practices, I'm listening.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "**Edit: Found the solution to this problem (tldr; WSL2 sucks), updated the post with the solution at the bottom of the post**\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI'm trying to run ollama on docker (windows), and it looks like there's some memory double dipping going on and I'm not sure why. I'm trying to run a 20GB model on a 5090, I'm seeing BOTH my system and VRAM memory go up as much when I load the model.\n\nSystem settings:\n\n* 64 GB of RAM\n* RTX 5090 (32 GB of VRAM)\n* Model:  olmo-3.1:32b-think (takes \\~20Gb of RAM to load)\n* Docker version 29.1.3, build f52814d (running on WSL2)\n\nfwiw, `ollama ps` does show the model loaded 100% on my GPU. Ran `nvidia-smi` in the ollama container, and it looks *fine* (I can see the ollama process running). While Windows task manager isn't able to pin down what process is responsible for the high gpu util, it does reflect memory utilization accurately. So I am using my GPU, I have plenty more VRAM to work with, so I'm not at all sure why system memory util spikes up 20GB during use.\n\nI installed the windows native version of ollama to see if I could replicate, and I do not see my system memory spike using that approach. So it seems like the involvement of docker here is introducing some funk.\n\nI've read through some similar posts here and saw there were issues a few years ago with docker on WSL2 and utilizing VRAM, but those issues seem to have since been resolved so hitting a dead end here. Wondering if anyone has had the same issue and has any tips?\n\nThanks\n\n# Solution/workaround\n\nFound the cause of the issue, it's a known [WSL issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166) (that's been open for 7 years...). Apparently WSL doesn't do a great job with memory management and sometimes never releases the memory used back to the system (I say sometimes but for me it's ALL the time). In this case with ollama, never releases the RAM it uses to load the model to VRAM.\n\nYou can manually confirm this, and release the memory with the following commands (s/o to Kirk, a random commenter on this [medium article I found](https://medium.com/@Tanzim/how-to-run-ollama-in-windows-via-wsl-8ace765cee12))\n\n    # Display memory usage\n    free -h\n    \n    sudo su <<EOF\n    # force memory write back to disk\n    sync\n    \n    # clear cache from memory\n    echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches\n    \n    EOF\n    # display memory again (should be cleared)\n\nAlso, looks like someone has a more automated solution out here too (haven't tried this so can't vouch but looks promising) : [https://github.com/arkane-systems/wsl-drop-cache?tab=readme-ov-file](https://github.com/arkane-systems/wsl-drop-cache?tab=readme-ov-file)\n\nNote: I am only sharing what I found.\n\nWhile these are solutions, they may not be the best or most appropriate solution if you're doing anything *real*. atm I'm just experimenting with this setup for personal reasons so it works for me.",

I know there are solutions for these things mixed into other software, but this is standalone and does just one thing really well for me.\n\n\\- create/version/store prompts.. don't have to worry about text files unless I want to  \n\\- runs from command line, can pipe stdout into anything.. eg Ollama, ci, git hooks  \n\\- easily render variations of prompts on the fly, inject {{variables}} or inject files.. e.g. git diffs or documents  \n\\- can store prompts globally or in projects, run anywhere\n\nBasic usage:\n\n    # Create a prompt.. paste in text\n    $ promptg prompt new my-prompt \n    \n    # -or-\n    $ echo \"Create a prompt with pipe\" | promptg prompt save hello\n    \n    # Then.. \n    $ promptg get my-prompt | ollama run deepseek-r1\n\nOr more advanced, render with dynamic variables and insert files..\n\n    # before..\n    cat prompt.txt | sed \"s/{{lang}}/Python/g; s/{{code}}/$(cat myfile.py)/g\" | ollama run mistral\n    \n    # now, replace dynamic {{templateValue}} and insert code/file.\n    promptg get code-review --var lang=Python --var code@myfile.py | ollama run mistral\n\nInstall:\n\n    npm install -g @promptg/cli",
