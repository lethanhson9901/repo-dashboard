      "text": "RAG is the standard way to connect documents to LLMs. Most people building RAGs know the steps by now: parse documents, chunk them, embed, store vectors, retrieve at query time. But something different happens when you're building systems that act rather than answer.\n\n### The RAG mental model\n\nRAG preprocessing optimizes for retrieval. Someone asks a question, you find relevant chunks, you synthesize an answer. The whole pipeline is designed around that interaction pattern.\n\nThe work happens before anyone asks anything. Documents get parsed into text, extracting content from PDFs, Word docs, HTML, whatever format you're working with. Then chunking splits that text into pieces sized for context windows. You choose a strategy based on your content: split on paragraphs, headings, or fixed token counts. Overlap between chunks preserves context across boundaries. Finally, embedding converts each chunk into a vector where similar meanings cluster together. \"The contract expires in December\" ends up near \"Agreement termination date: 12/31/2024\" even though they share few words. That's what makes semantic search work.\n\nRetrieval is similarity search over those vectors. Query comes in, gets embedded, you find the nearest chunks in vector space. For Q&A, this works well. You ask a question, the system finds relevant passages, an LLM synthesizes an answer. The whole architecture assumes a query-response pattern.\n\nThe requirements shift when you're building systems that act instead of answer.\n\n### What agentic actually needs\n\nConsider a contract monitoring system. It tracks obligations across hundreds of agreements: Example Bank owes a quarterly audit report by the 15th, so the system sends a reminder on the 10th, flags it as overdue on the 16th, and escalates to legal on the 20th. The system doesn't just find text about deadlines. It acts on them.\n\nThat requires something different at the data layer. The system needs to understand that Party A owes Party B deliverable X by date Y under condition Z. And it needs to connect those facts across documents. Not just find text about obligations, but actually know what's owed to whom and when.\n\nThe preprocessing has to pull out that structure, not just preserve text for later search. You're not chunking paragraphs. You're turning \"Example Bank shall submit quarterly compliance reports within 15 days of quarter end\" into data you can query: party, obligation type, deadline, conditions. Think rows in a database, not passages in a search index.\n\n### Two parallel paths\n\nThe architecture ends up looking completely different.\n\nRAG has a linear pipeline. Documents go in, chunking happens, embeddings get created, vectors get stored. At query time, search, retrieve, generate.\n\nAgentic systems need two tracks running in parallel. The main one pulls structured data out of documents. An LLM reads each contract, extracts the obligations, parties, dates, and conditions, and writes them to a graph database. Why a graph? Because you're not just storing isolated facts, you're storing how they connect. Example Bank owes a report. That report is due quarterly. The obligation comes from Section 4.2 of Contract #1847. Those connections between entities are what graph databases are built for. This is what powers the actual monitoring.\n\nBut you still need embeddings. Just for different reasons.\n\nThe second track catches what extraction misses. Sometimes \"the Lender\" in paragraph 12 needs to connect to \"Example Bank\" from paragraph 3. Sometimes you don't know what patterns matter until you see them repeated across documents. The vector search helps you find connections that weren't obvious enough to extract upfront.\n\nSo you end up with two databases working together. The graph database stores entities and their relationships: who owes what to whom by when. The vector database helps you find things you didn't know to look for.\n\nI wrote the rest on my [blog](https://nickrichu.me/posts/the-preprocessing-gap-between-rag-and-agentic).",

Iterating with the model helped surface bad assumptions before I committed to an approach. They’re especially good at starting broad and narrowing down if you keep the conversation going so context builds up.\n\nWhen I add new features now, I don’t explain my app’s architecture anymore. I just link the relevant GitHub repos so the model can see how things are structured. That alone cut feature dev time from weeks to about a day in one case.\n\nI’m not saying prompt engineering is useless, just that for most practical work, context, iteration, and model choice mattered more for me.\n\nCurious how others here approach this. Has prompt engineering been critical for you, or have you seen similar results?\n\n(I wrote up the full experience here if anyone wants more detail: [https://xthebuilder.github.io](https://xthebuilder.github.io))\n",

E.g. getting them to actually output in JSON consistently was a nightmare\n\n\nModern models are pretty good at rule following these days so there isn't really any secrets to prompting them \"correctly\" these days\n\n\nAs you highlighted, context management is far more important these days, hence the new buzzword is \"context engineering\" ",

In early models, carefully crafting a prompt was really the best you could do to ground the model's output.  We have many, many more tools available to us now to set a meaningful foundation for the model to use in generating output.\n\nIf you give the model tons of \\_really good\\_ information in  the codebase, supporting documents, etc etc etc, the user prompt becomes less and less critical.\n\nThe illustration I use at work is to imagine a random stranger comes up at you with a pile of papers, tells you to summarize the data therein for them, and, if you do a good job, you get $1M.  Imagine how you the quality of your product improves if the data has good labels... or if there's a previous report drawing on similar data that's there as an example. Or if the person also tells you what industry they're in.  Or if they tell you to \"imagine you're a customer service manager\" or whatever.\n\nEach little bit of information available improves your output.  The prompt is vital if that's all you give the model.  But context is \\_everything\\_.",

      "text": "I spent last weekend building something I had been thinking about for a while. Claude Cowork is great, but I wanted an open-source, lightweight version that could run with any model, so I created Open Cowork.\n\nIt's written entirely in Rust, which I had never used before. Starting from scratch meant no heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on existing agent SDKs. Just a tiny, fast binary that works anywhere.\n\nSecurity was a big concern since the agents can execute code. Open Cowork handles this by running tasks inside temporary Docker containers. Everything stays isolated, but you can still experiment freely.\n\nYou can plug in any model you want. OpenAI, Anthropic, or even fully offline LLMs through Ollama are all supported. You keep full control over your API keys and your data.\n\nIt already comes with built-in skills for handling documents like PDFs and Excel files. I was surprised by how useful it became right away.\n\nThe development experience was wild. An AI agent helped me build a secure, open-source version of itself, and I learned Rust along the way. It was one of those projects where everything just clicked together in a weekend.\n\nThe code is live on GitHub: [https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse\\_cowork](https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse_cowork) . It's still early, but I'd love to hear feedback from anyone who wants to try it out or contribute.",

      "text": "Hey!\n\nI want to use Ollama to integrate it with a game engine. It's already in the engine and working, but I have some questions on what model I should use, and any tips in general for the experiments I want to do. I understand most LLMs running locally will take a while to think and generate a response, but for now let's ignore that.\n\n1. NPC Chat with commands: I know most people have tried doing NPC chatbots in engines, but I was thinking I could try to spice that up by integrating commands on it. Like the LLM would have a list of commands, given by me, that it could use contextually, like /laugh /cry /givePlayer(item), things like that. And I can make a system that parses the string and extracts/executes the commands. I attempted this one time, not in engine, just by using regular chat GPT and it would eventually come up with its own commands that were not stipulated by me. How to avoid that? Is there a model I should use for that?\n2. NPC consistency in character. I also tried one time to keep chat GPT in character, a peasant from the medieval ages, but I would ask about modern events like COVID and it would eventually break and talk about it as if he knew what it was.\n3. NPC Memory. What if I wanted to have NPCs remember things they have witnessed? I imagine I should make a log system that keeps every action done to that npc (NPC was hit by Player. NPC killed bandit. NPC found 1 gold etc) and then adding it to the beggining of the prompt as a little memory. Is that enough?\n4. Can I reliably limit the response length or is it finicky? Like, setting a limit of how many words per response \n5. Is there a way to guarantee responses are always in character? Because sometimes some of the LLMs will say \"I cannot answer to things related to that\" and that would be a big immersion breaker \n\nAnd another general question, is there a way to train certain models to get them used to a certani context? like i said, using commands I create in my game, or training them to act like a specific type of character etc.\n\nAgain, other than my experiments with just the chat GPT window, I am pretty new to this. If you have advice on what models to use or best practices, I'm listening.\n\nThank you!",

      "text": "Hi all; I don't usually use LLM's so thought I'd ask here if I'm doing this correctly - or if there is a better way to do it.\n\nI run the Hasheous project - the idea is that if you supply an MD5/SHA1 hash, Hasheous can respond with mappings to video game metadata suppliers such as IGDB and others.\n\nJust as a \"I thought this might be a cool addition\" feature, I wanted to add descriptions and tags to each record generated from the mapped metadata sources so that I could provide data to ROM management apps to provide similar games and the basis of a game recommendation engine.\n\nI don't have the budget for offloading this to commercial AI providers (this is a free open source project), so I'm going with a distributed model where anyone could download an agent to use their own installation of Ollama to generate the description and tags.\n\nWith the help of Copilot, I came up with the following:\n\n- pull the description for each mapped data source (IGDB, GiantBomb, Wikipedia, etc) and add them as embedded content. Copilot recommended the nomic-embed-text model to generate the vectors.\n\n- run a CosineSimularity over the response to extract the top `x` results (I won't pretend to understand how this function works!)\n\n- run this through a prompt generator which generates a string with the top `x` embeddings under the heading \"Context:\", and the the prompts below under the heading \"Instructions:\"\n\n- call the `/generate` endpoint with the RAG prompt generator to create the response\n\nFor the description model, I'm using Gemma3:12b, with the prompt:\n```\nGenerate a detailed description/synopsis for the game <DATA_OBJECT_NAME> for <DATA_OBJECT_PLATFORM>.\n\nIf present; use the Wikipedia source as context for the other provided sources.\n\nYou MUST respond only with the description/synopsis. Do not acknowledge you've received this request.\n\nThe description should be engaging and informative, highlighting plot, key features, and gameplay. Keep the description concise, ideally between 150 to 200 words, but no more than 250 words. The output should be in markdown format.\n```\n\nFor the tags model, I'm using qwen3:8b, with the prompt:\n```\nYou are an expert whose responsibility is to help with automatic tagging for a game recommendation engine.\n\nGenerate detailed tags for the game <DATA_OBJECT_NAME> for <DATA_OBJECT_PLATFORM>.\n\nIf present; use the Wikipedia source as context for the other provided sources.\n\nThe tags should accurately represent the game. Only generate tags in the following categories: Genre, Gameplay, Features, Theme, Perspective, and Art Style.\n\nEach tag should be no more than three words long. Ensure each tag is specific and commonly used within the gaming community, but avoid overly broad or generic terms. If you are unable to generate tags relevant to the category, leave it empty.\n\nGenerate a minimum of three tags and a maximum of ten tags per category.\n\nFormat the output as a raw JSON object, containing an array of tags for each category.\n\nMake sure the JSON is properly structured and valid.\n\nExample output:\n{\n    \"Genre\": [\n        \"Action\",\n        \"Adventure\"\n    ],\n    \"Gameplay\": [\n        \"Open World\",\n        \"Multiplayer\"\n    ],\n    \"Features\": [\n        \"Crafting\",\n        \"Character Customization\"\n    ],\n    \"Theme\": [\n        \"Sci-Fi\",\n        \"Fantasy\"\n    ],\n    \"Perspective\": [\n        \"First-Person\",\n        \"Third-Person\"\n    ],\n    \"Art Style\": [\n        \"Realistic\",\n        \"Pixel Art\"\n    ]\n}\n\nDo not include any additional text or content outside of the JSON object.\n```\n\nExample output here: https://beta.hasheous.org/index.html?page=dataobjectdetail&type=game&id=109\n\nI was wondering if anyone had any advice or suggestions to make this process faster or more accurate - or just better :)\n\nCurrently takes about 3 minutes per game on my GTX970 (my best GPU sadly) to generate the description and tags, so performance improvements would also be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance!",
