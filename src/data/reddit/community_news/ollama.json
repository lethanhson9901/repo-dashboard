When you first spin up Smarterrouter it profiles all your models, giving them scores for all the main types of prompts you could ask, as well as benchmark other things like model size, actual VRAM usage, etc. (you can even configure an external \"Judge\" AI to grade the responses the models give, i've found it improves the profile results, but it's optional). It will also detect and new or deleted models and start profiling them in the background, you don't need to do anything, just add your models to ollama and they will be added to SmarterRouter to be used.\n\nThere's a lot going on under the hood, but i've been putting it through it's paces and so far it's performing really well, It's extremely fast, It caches responses, and I'm seeing a negligible amount of time added to prompt response time. It will also automatically load and unload the models in Ollama (and any other backend that allows that).\n\nThe only caveat i've found is that currently it favors very small, high performing models, like Qwen coder 0.5B for example, but if small models are faster and they score really highly in the benchmarks... Is that really a bad response? I'm doing more digging, but so far it's working really well with all the test prompts i've given it to try (swapping to larger/different models for more complex questions or creative questions that are outside of the small models wheelhouse).\n\nHere's a high level summary of the biggest features:\n\n**Self-Correction via Hardware Profiling**: Instead of guessing performance, it runs a one-time benchmark on your specific GPU/CPU setup. It learns exactly how fast and capable your models are in your unique environment.\n\n**Active VRAM Guard**: It monitors nvidia-smi in real-time. If a model selection is about to trigger an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error, it proactively unloads idle models or chooses a smaller alternative to keep your system stable.\n\n**Semantic \"Smart\" Caching**: It doesn't just match exact text. It uses vector embeddings to recognize when you’re asking a similar question to a previous one, serving the cached response instantly and saving your compute cycles.\n\n**The \"One Model\" Illusion**: It presents your entire collection of 20+ models as a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You just select SmarterRouter in your UI, and it handles the \"load, run, unload\" logic behind the scenes.\n\n**Intelligence-to-Task Routing**: It automatically analyzes your prompt's complexity. It won't waste your 70B model's time on a \"Hello,\" and it won't let a 0.5B model hallucinate its way through a complex Python refactor.\n\n**LLM-as-Judge Feedback**: It can use a high-end model (like a cloud GPT-4o or a local heavy-hitter) to periodically \"score\" the performance of your smaller models, constantly refining its own routing weights based on actual quality.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/peva3/SmarterRouter\n\nLet me know how this works for you, I have it running perfectly with a 4060 ti 16gb, so i'm positive that it will scale well to the massive systems some of y'all have.",

This would allow something like openwebui to punch way above it's weight locally by being able to swap between all of the best models that you can fit in your GPU. \n\nSo the long long term idea is that this would be a sort of analog to how large AI companies are doing MoE prompt routing, but it would just live in your house instead of having to rely on anything outside your network.",

As a beginner myself, I often found it a bit overwhelming to figure out which models would actually run \"well\" on my specific machine versus just running \"slowly.\"\n\nTo help myself learn and to give something back to other newcomers, I put together a small CLI tool in Go called **RigRank**.\n\n**What it does:** It’s basically a simple benchmarking suite for Ollama. It doesn’t measure how \"smart\" a model is—there are way better tools for that—but it measures the \"snappiness\" of your actual hardware. It runs a few stages (code gen, summarization, reasoning, etc.) and gives you a \"Report Card\" with:\n\n* **TTFT (Time To First Token):** How long you’re waiting for that first word.\n* **Writing Speed:** How fast it actually spits out text.\n* **Reading Speed:** How quickly it processes your prompts.\n\n**Who this is for:** Honestly, if you already have a complex benchmarking pipeline or a massive GPU cluster, this probably isn't for you. It’s designed for the person who just downloaded Ollama and wants to know: *\"Is Llama3-8B too heavy for my laptop, or is it just me?\"*\n\n**I would love your feedback**\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank](https://github.com/rohanelukurthy/rig-rank)",

Works as a lightweight wrapper around any Ollama call (or other providers in hybrid).\n\n**Free forever.

Point it at your local LLM server\n3. Set a workspace directory in a `.env` file\n4. Run `python agent_main.py`\n\nWorks on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

You want the MLX version, which I believe is still easier to do in LM Studio than Ollama (but haven't tried in ollama lately) to run a bit better on apple silicon. And you're pretty much gonna want to stick to a 4k context window as you don't have enough ram for the model plus a large amount of context. \n\nIf you need to work with more data in the context window, you'll need to use a smaller model to have more ram for it. Qwen and Mistrial 4b - 8b models work decent depending on what you are doing. But will be FAR behind any cloud model in capabilities. ",

      "text": "\\# \\[Guide\\] Full GPU Acceleration for Ollama on Mac Pro 2013 (Dual FirePro D700) - Linux\n\n\n\nHey everyone! I finally managed to get full GPU acceleration working for \\*\\*Ollama\\*\\* on the legendary \\*\\*Mac Pro 6.1 (2013 \"Trashcan\")\\*\\* running Nobara Linux (and it should work on other distros too).\n\n\n\nThe problem with these machines is that they have dual \\*\\*AMD FirePro D700s (Tahiti XT)\\*\\*. By default, Linux uses the legacy \\`radeon\\` driver for these cards. While \\`radeon\\` works for display, it \\*\\*does not support Vulkan or ROCm\\*\\*, meaning Ollama defaults to the CPU, which is slow as molasses.\n\n\n\n\\### My Setup:\n\n\\- \\*\\*Model:\\*\\* Mac Pro 6,1 (Late 2013)\n\n\\- \\*\\*CPU:\\*\\* Xeon E5-1680 v2 (8C/16T @ 3.0 GHz)\n\n\\- \\*\\*RAM:\\*\\* 32GB\n\n\\- \\*\\*GPU:\\*\\* Dual AMD FirePro D700 (6GB each, 12GB total VRAM)\n\n\\- \\*\\*OS:\\*\\* Nobara Linux (Fedora 40/41 base)\n\n\n\n\\### The Solution:\n\nWe need to force the \\`amdgpu\\` driver for the Southern Islands (SI) architecture. Once \\`amdgpu\\` is active, Vulkan is enabled, and Ollama picks up both GPUs automatically!\n\n\n\n\\### Performance (The Proof):\n\nI'm currently testing \\*\\*\\`qwen2.5-coder:14b\\`\\*\\* (9GB model). \n\n\\- \\*\\*GPU Offload:\\*\\* 100% (49/49 layers)\n\n\\- \\*\\*VRAM Split:\\*\\* Perfectly balanced across both D700s (\\~4GB each)\n\n\\- \\*\\*Speed:\\*\\* \\*\\*\\~11.5 tokens/second\\*\\* 🚀\n\n\\- \\*\\*Total Response Time:\\*\\* \\~13.8 seconds for a standard coding prompt.\n\n\n\nOn CPU alone, this model was barely usable at <2 tokens/sec. This fix makes the Trashcan a viable local LLM workstation in 2026!\n\n\n\n\\### How to do it:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*1. Update Kernel Parameters\\*\\*\n\nAdd these to your GRUB configuration:\n\n\\`radeon.si\\_support=0 amdgpu.si\\_support=1\\`\n\n\n\nOn Fedora/Nobara:\n\n\\`\\`\\`bash\n\nsudo sed -i 's/GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT=\"/GRUB\\_CMDLINE\\_LINUX\\_DEFAULT=\"radeon.si\\_support=0 amdgpu.si\\_support=1 /' /etc/default/grub\n\nsudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n\n\n\\*\\*2. Reboot\\*\\*\n\n\\`sudo reboot\\`\n\n\n\n\\*\\*3. Container Config (Crucial!)\\*\\*\n\nIf you're running Ollama in a container (Podman or Docker), you MUST:\n\n\\- Pass \\`/dev/dri\\` to the container.\n\n\\- Set \\`OLLAMA\\_VULKAN=1\\`.\n\n\\- Disable security labels (SecurityLabel=disable in Quadlet).\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Result:\\*\\*\n\nMy D700s are now identified as \\*\\*Vulkan0\\*\\* and \\*\\*Vulkan1\\*\\* in Ollama logs, and they split the model VRAM perfectly! 🚀\n\n\n\nI've put together a GitHub-ready folder with scripts and configs here: \\[Link to your repo\\]\n\n\n\nHope this helps any fellow Trashcan owners out there trying to run local LLMs!\n\n\n\n\\#MacPro #Linux #Ollama #SelfHosted #AMD #FireProD700",

My gaming rig has a 5070ti 16gb but isn’t always on, and my “dedicated” unraid server \\*\\*had\\*\\* a 3060ti 8gb that was going to be my AI workhorse.\n\nI chose models that would kick ass on the 5070 when online and more conservative models for the 3060 otherwise.\n\nThis is all still experimental/for learning so this setup is fines for me … except the unraid server was painfully slow. Took me way too long to figure out that’s because it was hitting an old GTX 1650 4gb card!! I forgot I swapped out the cards because I was going to build a gaming rig for my kid with the 3060.\n\nI spent way too long researching models and trying to figure out why my “3060” was offloading over 50% of qwen3:4b to my CPU. Since this is hosted on unraid I was convinced that another service (plex?) was using my GPU without permission. Nope, I’m just a doofus.\n\nIt wasn’t until running \\`nvidia-smi\\` in terminal that I realized my error.\n\nAnyways, hope this makes someone chuckle as much as me.
