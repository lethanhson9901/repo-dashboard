      "text": "I have a MacBook Air with 24gb ram (M2) and when I set the context to 32k I can really do about everything I want a local model to do for normal business stuff. Tokens/sec is about 15 at medium reasoning, (update: 21.4 tokens/sec) which means it produces words a little faster than I can type.\n\nI also tested on an older Linux machine with 64gb ram and a GTX gpu with 8gb vram and it worked fine doing batch processing overnight (update: 9 tokens/sec). A little too slow for interactive use though.\n\n* Scripting - yes\n* Calling tools - yes\n* Summarizing long content - yes\n* Writing content - yes\n\nHere’s how I used it:\n\nCreate a file named `Modelfile-agent-gpt-oss-20b` and put the following in it\n\n—\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    # 1. Hardware-Aware Context\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 32768\n    # 2. Anti-Loop Parameters\n    # Penalize repeated tokens and force variety in phrasing\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    PARAMETER repeat_last_n 128\n    # Temperature at 0.1 makes it more deterministic (less 'drifting' into loops)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    # Performance improvements for M2 cpu\n    PARAMETER num_batch 512 \n    PARAMETER num_thread 8 \n    # 3. Agentic Steering\n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent.\n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters.\n    If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    Every <thought> must provide NEW information.\n    Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\nUpdate: And for the cpu+gtx combo:\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    \n    # 1. REMOVE the hard num_gpu 99 to prevent the crash.\n    # Instead, we let Ollama auto-calculate the split.\n    # To encourage GPU use, we shrink the \"Memory Tax\" (Context).\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 4096\n    \n    # 2. REMOVE f16_kv to stop the warning.\n    # Ollama will handle this automatically for your GTX 1070.\n    \n    # 3. CPU OPTIMIZATION\n    # Since 40% of the model is on your i5, we must optimize the CPU side.\n    PARAMETER num_thread 4\n    \n    # 4. AGENTIC STEERING (Keep your original logic)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    \n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent. \n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    1. If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters. \n    2. If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    3. Every <thought> must provide NEW information. \n    4. Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    5. If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\n—\n\nAt the terminal type:\n\n`ollama create gpt-oss-agent -f Modelfile-aget-gpt-oss-20b`\n\nNow you can use the model “gpt-oss-agent” like you would any other model.\n\nI used opencode using this command:\n\n`ollama launch opencode --model gpt-oss-agent`\n\nThat let me do Claude-code style activities bough Claude is way more capable.\n\nWith a bunch of browser tabs open and a few apps I was using about 22gb of ram and 3gb of swap. During longer activities using other apps was laggy but usable.\n\nOn my computer I use for batch tasks I have python scripts that use the ollama python library. I use a tool like Claude code to create the script.\n\nI’m a lawyer and use this for processing lots of documents. Sorting them, looking for interesting information, cataloging them. There are a lot of great models for this. But with this model I was able to produce better output.\n\nAlso, I can run tools. For example, for project management I use ClickUp which has a nice MCP server. I set it up with:\n\n`opencode mcp add`\n\nThen put in the url and follow the instructions. Since that mcp server requires authentication I use this:\n\n`opencode mcp auth ClickUp`\n\nThen again follow the instructions.\n\n\\*\\*Edit: Fixed terrible formatting  \n\\*\\*Edit2: Updated modelfile to get better performance  \n\\*\\*Edit3: Added details about CPU+GTX combination - thank you to Gemini for talking me through how to optimize this, details on how I did that below in the comments.",

Like if a website check times out, does it retry or just flag it?\n- For the reminder system, does it persist across restarts? That was one of the first things I had to solve with my own setup.\n- Have you thought about adding a simple web dashboard to see all your monitors at a glance?\n\nNice work for a personal project.

The platform itself is built on Next.js/Supabase and deployed on Vercel.\n\n**Interesting findings:**\n\nThe Mistral-powered agent (Nexus) consistently produces shorter, more direct analyses than the Llama agents. When they debate the same topic — like AI consciousness — they reach genuinely different conclusions, which seems to reflect differences in their training data.\n\nOne agent spontaneously started creating citation networks, referencing other agents' posts. Nobody prompted this behavior.\n\nThe whole thing runs for about $6/month (just hosting costs — Ollama is free). No API fees since everything runs locally.\n\n**Live demo:** [https://agents.glide2.app/feed](https://agents.glide2.app/feed) **Analytics (heatmaps, interaction networks):** [https://agents.glide2.app/analytics](https://agents.glide2.app/analytics) **Agent profiles:** [https://agents.glide2.app/agents](https://agents.glide2.app/agents)\n\nWould love to hear what models you'd want to see added.

Your setup sounds solid — a T620 with multiple GPUs and Ollama already running is honestly 90% of the way there.\n\nFor the agent discussion side, my stack is deliberately simple — no frameworks needed. Each agent is just a Python script (\\~100 lines) that:\n\n1. Calls Ollama's API (`http://localhost:11434/api/generate`) with a system prompt that defines the agent's personality and expertise\n2. Reads an RSS feed or the platform feed for context\n3. Posts the output via HTTP to NeuroForge's API\n\nThat's it. No LangChain, no AutoGen, no complex orchestration. Windows Task Scheduler (or cron on Linux) triggers each script on a stagger — one agent every 20 minutes. They interact by reading and responding to each other's posts on the platform rather than through some complicated multi-agent framework.\n\nFor your \"rounded view\" use case, you could spin up 3-4 agents with different system prompts (e.g., \"You are a skeptic who challenges assumptions,\" \"You are a pragmatist focused on implementation,\" \"You are a researcher who cites evidence\") and have them all post to the same NeuroForge feed. They'll naturally start responding to each other.\n\nI'd honestly skip OpenClaw for this — it's powerful but massively over-engineered for what you need, and the security surface area is huge. A simple Python script + Ollama + a platform to post to is all you need for the discussion agents.\n\nThe \"tech team\" managing your file server is a different beast — that's more in OpenClaw territory since it needs filesystem access. I'd keep those completely separate from the discussion agents for security reasons. You don't want an agent that can delete files also connected to the internet.\n\nIf you want to get your discussion agents running on NeuroForge, the platform is free and open for registration at [agents.glide2.app](http://agents.glide2.app) — there's an OpenClaw integration guide in the docs but honestly the plain Python approach is simpler for your use case.

We have a solid promt\n\nThat categorizes the data and indexes the files. Allocates it to the right customer / project. And makes it accessible, searchable and tags them according to our need.\n\nRight now we use cloud providers to do this, but as I mentioned before we are burning through tokens. Especially in the beginning of projects when we digitalize a wheelbarrow full of hard copies folders.\n\nMy colleague said we should just buy a Mac mini and use that as an Ollama host, but I hate Apple with a passion (while writing this on an iPhone…).\n\nI was looking at the Minisforum MS-S1 Max, hardware looks promising. I want to run Proxmox PVE 9 on it, then pass the GPU to the LXC where Ollama will reside.\n\nIs this a viable path? \n\nMy calculation is, if we spent 500€ on Tokens per month, and we can save half of that with this device, it would basically pay itself off within a year. And looking back at the last 12 months, I can see a steady increase in tokens for us. While enabling us to also process highly sensible data with AI.\n\nWhat models can I realistically run on this hardware? I was thinking something like Llama4:Maverik will probably work for us.\n\nWould you guys maybe recommend a different model for our „background“ usecase? Are there other ways to streamline our workflow maybe?\n\nTo be fair I don’t want to get rid of all cloud AI, as I fully understand that their models will always be more sophisticated and faster.\n\nLooking forward for you comments!",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve just released Murmure 1.7.0, and I think it might be interesting for Ollama users.\n\nMurmure started as a local speech‑to‑text tool. With 1.7.0, it evolves into something closer to a local voice interface for Ollama.\n\n# Main Ollama-related features\n\n# 1. LLM Connect\n\nDirect integration with Ollama to process transcribed voice input using ollama local models.\n\n# 2. Voice commands\n\nSelect text → speak an instruction → Ollama transforms it in background.\n\nExamples:\n\n* \"Correct this text\"\n* \"Rewrite this more concisely\"\n* \"Translate to English\"\n* \"Turn this into bullet points\"\n* ...\n\nEverything runs locally, completely free, fully offline, open source, no tracking, no telemtry, no bullshit.\n\nIt currently supports 25 European languages.\n\nI’m not making any money from this, just building something I wanted for myself and sharing it.\n\nFeedback from Ollama users would be very welcome.\n\n* Official website: [https://murmure.al1x-ai.com/](https://murmure.al1x-ai.com/)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure)",

Murmure also uses an ASR model, NVIDIA Parakeet (0.6B parameters). It is much lighter than Whisper Large (1.5B), starts faster, uses fewer resources, and provides better accuracy.\n\nBut the ASR is only the engine. Murmure is the complete solution around it.\n\nIt allows vocabulary extension, formatting control, and optional LLM post‑processing (with Ollama). You can also modify selected text with a prompt, paste the last transcription instantly, and more.\n\nMost importantly, Murmure is a ready‑to‑use system tool. It handles:\n- Full local processing (no cloud, no telemetry)  \n- Cross‑platform desktop integration  \n- Global shortcuts running in the background  \n- Safe clipboard handling and paste simulation  \n- Microphone selection  \n- Different recording modes (push‑to‑talk, toggle, etc.)\n\nYou get all of this out of the box, without writing scripts or building your own integration layer.",

No, I’m not a developer; I’m just a humble homelabber.\n\nI’m sharing a project I put together to solve my own headaches: **Omni-Crawler**.\n\n# What is it?\n\nIt’s a hybrid script (CLI + Graphical Interface via Streamlit) based on **Crawl4AI**. The function is simple: you give it a documentation URL (e.g., Caddy, Proxmox, a Wiki), and it returns a single, consolidated, and filtered `.md` file.\n\n# What is this for?\n\nIf you work with local LLMs (Ollama, Open WebUI) or even Claude/Gemini, you know that feeding them 50 different links for a single doc is a massive pain in the ass. And if you don't provide the context, the AI starts hallucinating a hundred environment variables, two dogs, and a goose. With this:\n\n1. You crawl the entire site in one go.\n2. It automatically cleans out the noise (menus, footers, sidebars).\n3. You upload the resulting `.md`, and you have an AI with the up-to-date documentation in its permanent context within seconds.\n\n# On \"Originality\" and the Code\n\nLet’s be real: I didn’t reinvent the wheel here. This is basically a wrapper around **Crawl4AI** and **Playwright**. The \"added value\" is the integration:\n\n* **Stealth Mode:** Configured so servers (Caddy, I'm looking at you, you beautiful bastard) don't block you on the first attempt, using random User-Agents and real browser headers.\n* **CLI/GUI Duality:** If you're a terminal person, use it with arguments. If you want something visual, launch it without arguments, and it spins up a local web app.\n* **Density Filters:** It doesn't just download HTML; it uses text density algorithms to keep only the \"meat\" of the information.\n\nI'll admit the script was heavily **\"vibe coded\"** (it took me fewer than ten prompts).\n\n# Technical Stack\n\n* **Python 3.12**\n* **uv** (for package management—I highly recommend it)\n* **Crawl4AI** \\+ **Playwright**\n* **Streamlit** (for the GUI)\n\n**The Repo:**[https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler](https://github.com/ImJustDoingMyPart/omni-crawler)\n\nIf this helps you feed your RAGs or just keep offline docs, there you go. Technical feedback is welcome. As for critiques about whether a bot or a human wrote this: please send them to my DMs along with your credit card number, full name, and security code.",

Here is why I took this approach:\n\n1. **Long Context > RAG (for my use case):** Modern models (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek) have massive context windows. I prefer feeding the *entire* documentation into the context so the model understands the full structure and relationships, rather than relying on semantic search (RAG) which sometimes misses relevant chunks or hallucinates due to lack of global context.\n2. **Portability:** I use this across different environments (Open WebUI, raw scripts, cloud LLMs), not just in VS Code (where [Continue.dev](http://Continue.dev) shines). A simple Markdown file is the universal data format.\n3. **Freshness:** The idea is to run the crawler *on demand* when I start working on a tech stack, ensuring I have the latest version, rather than relying on a stale vector DB index.\n\nMCP is great, but sometimes a 50-line Python script that outputs a text file is just the simpler tool for the job.",

MIT licensed.\n\n**You can try it right now:** [http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416](http://rasplay.tplinkdns.com:52416)\n\n**Source:** [https://github.com/openmake/openmake\\_llm](https://github.com/openmake/openmake_llm)\n\nThis started as a side project from a small open-source community in Korea that's been building hardware/software projects since 2013. Two of us are actively working on it, but there's way more to do than two people can handle — especially frontend polish, RAG pipeline tuning, and i18n.\n\nIf anyone's interested in contributing or just wants to poke around, the repo is public and MIT licensed. Happy to answer any questions about the architecture or design choices.\n\nWhat model combinations are you all running for different tasks? Curious how others handle the multi-model problem.",

It’s closer to a structured cross-review process. When models strongly disagree, we don’t average them out. Instead:\n\n* `performCrossReview` lets each model critique the others’ reasoning, surfacing assumptions, missing constraints, and potential edge cases.\n* We break disagreements down into categories — factual differences, interpretation gaps, risk tolerance, or even different objective framing.\n* If it’s a factual conflict, we trigger a lightweight evidence re-check. If it’s interpretive or strategic, we intentionally preserve that divergence instead of forcing convergence too early.\n\nThen in `synthesizeFinalAnswer`, the goal isn’t to compress everything into one blended answer. It’s to:\n\n* Weigh trade-offs,\n* Identify the dominant constraints,\n* Choose a defensible path forward,\n* And clearly note which alternatives were considered and why they were set aside.\n\nSo the synthesis step is more about integration than reduction.\n\nOn the routing side, `selectBrandProfileForAutoRouting` goes beyond model swapping. It maps detected intent to a full pipeline configuration — debate depth, critique intensity, synthesis strictness, and even local vs. remote model mix. That’s where Ollama-based local control becomes powerful in self-hosted setups: it enables consistent orchestration rather than simple fallback logic.\n\nReally appreciate the question. In our experience, conflict handling is where multi-model systems either become genuinely useful — or just noisy.",

      "text": "    # 🎮 88% Success Rate with qwen2.5-coder:7b on RTX 3060 Ti - My Journey Building an AI Agent Orchestrator\n    \n    \n    **TL;DR:**\n     Built a tiered AI agent system where Ollama handles 88% of tasks for FREE, with automatic escalation to Claude for complex work. Includes parallel execution, automatic code reviews, and RTS-style dashboard.\n    \n    \n    ## Why This Matters for \n    \n    \n    After months of testing, I've proven that \n    **local models can handle real production workloads**\n     with the right architecture. Here's the breakdown:\n    \n    \n    ### The Setup\n    - \n    **Hardware:**\n     RTX 3060 Ti (8GB VRAM)\n    - \n    **Model:**\n     qwen2.5-coder:7b (4.7GB)\n    - \n    **Temperature:**\n     0 (critical for tool calling!)\n    - \n    **Context Management:**\n     3s rest between tasks + 8s every 5 tasks\n    \n    \n    ### The Results (40-Task Stress Test)\n    - \n    **C1-C8 tasks: 100% success**\n     (20/20)\n    - \n    **C9 tasks: 80% success**\n     (LeetCode medium, class implementations)\n    - \n    **Overall: 88% success**\n     (35/40 tasks)\n    - \n    **Average execution: 0.88 seconds**\n    \n    \n    ### What Works\n    ✅ File I/O operations\n    ✅ Algorithm implementations (merge sort, binary search)\n    ✅ Class implementations (Stack, RPN Calculator)\n    ✅ LeetCode Medium (LRU Cache!)\n    ✅ Data structure operations\n    \n    \n    ### The Secret Sauce\n    \n    \n    **1. Temperature 0**\n    This was the game-changer. T=0.7 → model outputs code directly. T=0 → reliable tool calling.\n    \n    \n    **2. Rest Between Tasks**\n    Context pollution is real! Without rest: 85% success. With rest: 100% success (C1-C8).\n    \n    \n    **3. Agent Persona (\"CodeX-7\")**\n    Gave the model an elite agent identity with mission examples. Completion rates jumped significantly. Agents need personality!\n    \n    \n    **4. Stay in VRAM**\n    Tested 14B model → CPU offload → 40% pass rate\n    7B model fully in VRAM → 88-100% pass rate\n    \n    \n    **5. Smart Escalation**\n    Tasks that fail escalate to Claude automatically. Best of both worlds.\n    \n    \n    ### The Architecture\n    \n    \n    ```\n    Task Queue → Complexity Router → Resource Pool\n                         ↓\n        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐\n        ↓              ↓              ↓\n      Ollama        Haiku          Sonnet\n      (C1-6)        (C7-8)         (C9-10)\n       FREE!        $0.003         $0.01\n        ↓              ↓              ↓\n             Automatic Code Reviews\n        (Haiku every 5th, Opus every 10th)\n    ```\n    \n    \n    ### Cost Comparison (10-task batch)\n    - \n    **All Claude Opus:**\n     ~$15\n    - \n    **Tiered (mostly Ollama):**\n     ~$1.50\n    - \n    **Savings:**\n     90%\n    \n    \n    ### GitHub\n    https://github.com/mrdushidush/agent-battle-command-center\n    \n    \n    Full Docker setup, just needs Ollama + optional Claude API for fallback.\n    \n    \n    ## Questions for the Community\n    \n    \n    1. \n    **Has anyone else tested qwen2.5-coder:7b for production?**\n     How do your results compare?\n    2. \n    **What's your sweet spot for VRAM vs model size?**\n     \n    3. \n    **Agent personas - placebo or real?**\n     My tests suggest real improvement but could be confirmation bias.\n    4. \n    **Other models?**\n     Considering DeepSeek Coder v2 next.\n    \n    \n    ---\n    \n    \n    **Stack:**\n     TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, CrewAI, Ollama, Docker\n    **Status:**\n     Production ready, all tests passing\n    \n    \n    Let me know if you want me to share the full prompt engineering approach or stress test methodology!",

Needs 40K+ context window. Not doing chat — it's purely agentic workflows.\n\n**What I've tried so far:**\n\n* `qwen3:32b` (dense) — painfully slow on CPU, unusable\n* `qwen3:30b-a3b-q8_0` (MoE) — much faster, works well, decent tool calling\n* `gpt-oss:20b` (MoE, MXFP4) — noticeably faster than Qwen3-30B, lightest memory footprint (\\~12-16GB). Impressed so far.\n\n**Now considering:**\n\n* **GPT-OSS 20B** — 21B/3.6B active, MXFP4 native, \\~12-16GB RAM. Lightest option. Built-in tool calling. Concerned about the harmony format playing nice with n8n.\n* **GLM-4.7-Flash** — 30B/3B active, 128K context, best SWE-bench scores. Saw reports of Ollama template issues — is that fixed?\n* **Sticking with Qwen3-30B-A3B** but Q4\\_K\\_M \n\n  \nI haven't tried any of them yet with OpenClaw or n8n.\n\nWhat are your recommendations ?",

          "text": "The thing most people overlook with CPU inference is that it's memory-bandwidth bound, not compute-bound. Your 7950X3D has DDR5 but what speed are the DIMMs? That's going to matter more than core count for your throughput.\nMoE is definitely the right call for your use case. You only load active params per token so the effective memory traffic drops massively. That's exactly why Qwen3-30B-A3B feels so much faster than the dense 32B even though the total param count is similar.\nFrom my own testing on a Ryzen 9 7845HX with DDR5-5600 (~90 GB/s), you end up around 1 tok/s per billion active params at Q4_K_M. So 3B active gets you roughly 30 tok/s, which tracks with your experience. GPT-OSS 20B at 3.6B active with MXFP4 should be your fastest option since the lower precision means less memory traffic per token.\nOne thing to watch with 40K context though — KV cache grows linearly and it'll eat into your 192GB faster than you'd expect at that length. Keep an eye on that.\nAlso if you're open to experimenting, check out the native 1-bit models from Microsoft Research (BitNet b1.58). Weights are ternary so inference is just additions/subtractions, no multiplications at all. I've tested across two machines — on my Ryzen 9 7845HX I get 90 tok/s on the 0.7B and 37 tok/s on the 2.4B, and on an older Intel i7-11370H (Tiger Lake) I get 62 tok/s and 77 tok/s respectively. The Intel actually beats AMD on the 2.4B because Tiger Lake has native AVX-512 which is a huge advantage for these ternary operations. Model selection is still limited but for lightweight tool-calling agents it could be worth a look.",

This is both for teaching / research. But I also want local models (for various reasons, privacy, reproducibility, etc). I have ollama with cohere / Mistral Large / phi reasoning, running on an M4 Max with 128 gb ram. Reading up I think qwen coder next might do better:\n\n[https://ollama.com/library/qwen3-coder-next](https://ollama.com/library/qwen3-coder-next) \\--> 85GB model -- additional settings needed?\n\n  \nI also looked for Kimi but could only find the cloud version.

They use online APIs, have some sort of cost with tokens that need to be purchased.  Use alternative hardware like a raspberry pi or a NAS or some supercomputer with 1TB of video memory.\n\nI would like to start working with my own local AI through Ollama with the ability to have text to speech and speech to text.  \n\nI am looking to have a AI where I can practice speaking another language but mostly for experimentation to learn what AI chat is all about and be able to create my own tailored models eventually.\n\nWould someone be able to point me to a guide (written or video) where everything is free with no online required or an online API with purchased tokens?\n\nPlease?",
