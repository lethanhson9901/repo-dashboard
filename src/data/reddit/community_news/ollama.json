Sharing an open-source project that might be useful:\n\nLynkr connects AI coding tools (like Claude Code) to multiple LLM providers with intelligent routing.\n\n\nKey features:\n\n- Route between multiple providers: Databricks, Azure Ai Foundry, OpenRouter, Ollama,llama.cpp, OpenAi\n\n- Cost optimization through hierarchical routing, heavy prompt caching\n\n- Production-ready: circuit breakers, load shedding, monitoring\n\n- It supports all the features offered by claude code like sub agents, skills , mcp , plugins etc unlike other proxies which only supports basic tool callings and chat completions.\n\nGreat for:\n\n- Reducing API costs as it supports hierarchical routing where you can route requstes to smaller local models and later switch to cloud LLMs automatically.\n\n- Using enterprise infrastructure (Azure)\n\n-  Local LLM experimentation\n\n```bash\n\nnpm install -g lynkr\n\n```\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Fast-Editor/Lynkr (Apache 2.0)\n\nWould love to get your feedback on this one.

Can such a small local model do reliable tool calling, and can you extend it beyond local tools to work with remotely hosted MCP servers?\n\nHere’s what I tried:\n\n# Setup\n\n* Ran a quantized 4-bit (Q4\\_K\\_M) Ministral 3 3B on Ollama\n* Connected it to Open WebUI (with Docker)\n* Tested tool calling in two stages:\n   * Local Python tools inside Open WebUI\n   * **Remote MCP tools** via Composio (so the model can call externally hosted tools through MCP)\n\nThe model, despite the super tiny size of just 3B parameters, is said to support tool calling with even support for structured output. So, this was really fun to see the model in action.\n\nMost of the guides show you how to work with just the local tools, which is not ideal when you plan to use the model for bigger, better and managed tools for hundreds of different services. \n\nIn this guide, I've covered the model specs and the entire setup, including setting up a Docker container for Ollama and running Ollama WebUI.\n\nAnd the nice part is that the model setup guide here works for all the other models that support tool calling.\n\nI wrote up the full walkthrough with commands and screenshots:\n\nYou can find it here: [MCP tool calling guide with Ministral 3B, Composio, and Ollama](https://composio.dev/blog/tool-calling-with-ministral-3b)\n\nIf anyone else has tested tool calling on Ministral 3 3B (or worked with it using vLLM instead of Ollama), I’d love to hear what worked best for you, as I couldn't get vLLM to work due to CUDA errors. :(",

I wasn't stuck in login, for composio mcp, it;'s preconfigured with my gmail account and then it provides the endpoint url and the api key which is then configured in the mcp node (n8n) or in the settings of openwebui therefore no login is required.   \nThe reason I can ascertain is when using openrouter (in n8n or composio playground), it smoothly access the mcp and returned the mails without requiring me to login.   \nI rented a GPU server, I have tried pretty every single model listed in ollama/tools model list pages including the qwen32B but same outcome. I also tried this llama3-groq-tool-use:8b but same outcome, it struggle to engage the mcp tool and just return this {\"name\":\"GMAIL\\_LIST\\_MESSAGES\",\"parameters\":{\"query\":\"is:unread\"}} or this We need to respond to user. The user hasn't asked anything yet. Let's see what user says.No user message. Probably they want us to list available tools or do nothing. But the instruction says when user asks anything related to emails, etc. We have exactly one tool: googleworkspace\\_mcp. So we can call functions. But no user query yet. We should wait for user.Sure! Just let me know what you’d like to do with Gmail, Sheets, Drive, or any other Workspace feature, and I’ll fetch the real data for you.\"\"\n\nthis is the mcp tool that I added on composio, nevertheless, thanks for your thread, only found out about composio mcp from your thread, it's really good. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/quqjlfjhogbg1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=5131ff88d71b41631c4b05a1b96274ca6a5673ac",

While there is a way to configure these existing tools to run local models, it requires setup + configuration and these tools aren’t inherently built around it. Orla is designed to be built entirely around the local open source llm ecosystem. In addition, it also comes with a built in MCP server and an MCP tool registry where you can download tools from similar to Linux package managers like apt. For example, orla tool install fs gets you an open source file system tool. I’m currently working on a sandbox for these tools to run in and the hope is for the community to be able to write these tools and just plug them in either locally (as simple as putting them in Orla’s tool dir folder in the same directory as orla.yaml) or adding them to registry. A tool can be as simple as a bash script and orla with auto discover it and it usable to llms. The long term vision is essentially for orla to be as local, easy to deploy, and script with as a tool like grep. Thank you for your question!",

And my latest pipeline update is the graph.\n\n**\\*\\*Example:\\*\\*** \\`\\`\\` Day 1: \"My favorite pizza is Tunfisch\" Day 7: \"What's my favorite pizza?\" AI: \"Your favorite pizza is Tunfisch-Pizza!\" ✅ \\`\\`\\` \n\n**\\*\\*How it works:\\*\\***\n\n \\- Semantic search finds relevant memories (not just keywords)\n\n \\- Knowledge graph connects related facts - Auto-maintenance (deduplicates, merges similar entries) \n\n\\- 100% local (your data stays on YOUR machine)\n\n **\\*\\*Tech Stack:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- Ollama (DeepSeek-R1 for reasoning, Qwen for control) \n\n\\- SQLite + vector embeddings \n\n\\- Knowledge graphs with semantic/temporal edges \n\n\\- MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture\n\n \\- Docker compose setup \n\n**\\*\\*Current Status:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- 96.5% test coverage (57 passing tests) \n\n\\- Graph-based memory optimization \n\n\\-Cross-conversation retrieval working\n\n \\- Automatic duplicate detection\n\n \\- Production-ready (running on my Ubuntu server)\n\n**\\*\\*Looking for Beta Testers:\\*\\***\n\n \\- Linux users comfortable with Docker \n\n\\- Willing to use it for \\~1 week\n\n \\- Report bugs and memory accuracy\n\n \\- Share feedback on usefulness \n\n**\\*\\*What you get:\\*\\*** \n\n\\- Your own local AI with persistent memory\n\n \\- Full data privacy (everything stays local) \n\n\\- One-command Docker setup \n\n\\- GitHub repo + documentation \n\n**\\*\\*Why this matters:\\*\\*** \n\nLocal AI is great for privacy, but current solutions forget context constantly. This bridges that gap - you get privacy AND memory. Interested? Comment below and I'll share: - GitHub repo - Setup instructions - Bug report template Looking forward to getting this in real users' hands! 🚀 \n\n\\--- \n\n**\\*\\*Edit:\\*\\*** Just fixed a critical cross-conversation retrieval bug today - great timing for beta testing! 😄 \\`\\`\\`\n\n[https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis](https://github.com/danny094/Jarvis)\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q0rzbw/video/fb7n6q0dzmag1/player\n\n  \n",

I also have relationships with local non-profit organizations that are very interested in adding AI to their workflows and have major privacy concerns. \n\nUsage:\n\nFor me; local home network with two users looking for inference/chat capabilities as well as developing skills in local AI implementation.\n\n  \nFor non-profits; vectorizing a couple decades worth of documentation (reports in .doc, .pdf, .xls) for RAG, help with statistical analysis (they currently use SPSS), tool calling to search APIs for up-to-date information for literature reviews or adding context/examples to reports, day to day chat/inference.\n\n  \nBudget is $1500-2000 (could stretch this a bit if it will really improve the experience).\n\n  \nConcerns: having at least reasonable speed (conversational) with acceptable power consumption (say not drastically higher than a good quality PC workstation when idling).\n\nLooks like a high capacity (2tb-4tb) NVMe is helpful for model storage/loading.\n\nBudgeting $800 for a RTX 3090 as Nvidia seems to be the way to go and that is the least expensive way to get a decent amount of Vram. Also like the possibility of adding a second RTX 3090 in the future.\n\nShopping used as storage/RAM prices are what they are.\n\nWhere I am really stuck is CPU, motherboard, RAM combo. I see online builds using old HP Z440s, Z4 G4s, Lenovo P620s, or other older workstations with some success. Is Xeon/Threadripper/EPYC worth the power consumption penalty? What would they help with? Would I be better off with a newer (10th-12th gen) I5 or similar CPU? Is a high amount onboard RAM helpful? \n\n\n\nAny direction is appreciated. \n\n  \n",

But it does not need any fancy hardware. Optimise the models.\n\n  \n2. Frequency and size of new documents- this can be critical but mostly basic hardware will be able to manage this. Embed new documents and add to your vecotrdb. Add new documents incremently. Automate this in the night if workload is a concern.\n\n  \n3. Storage of vectorDB- I have built vectorDBs. You might never need TBs of storage.\n\n  \n4. Inference / chat- SLMs perform really well in RAG pipelines. Try inference on user's existing machine with gemma3:1b or even smollm2:135m.\n\n  \nFor two users for inference / chat with a decade of data, I would start at $0 if my user has access to mac with unified memory. If no, then I would get them used macbook at \\~ $600-700 each (preferably any mac with M series and 16GB RAM). For more users, mac mini / studio with more RAM might make sense.\n\n\n\nI have built similar setup for myself.  \nI believe older workstations make sense if you have a separate room for them because they are very noisy(vaccum cleaner level noise).  \nConsider only if they have space for it\n\n  \nI would love to collaborate on this project as volunteer if you are open to it!",

Today, I tried giving a specific URL to an LLM using the `#` prefix and asked it to summarize the content in Korean.\n\nAt first, I was quite impressed because the summary looked very plausible and well-structured. However, I later found out that Ollama models, by default, cannot access the internet or visit external links.\n\nThis leaves me with a few questions:\n\n1. **How did it generate the summary?** Was the LLM just \"guessing\" the content based on the words in the URL and its pre-existing training data? Or does Open WebUI pass some scraped metadata to the model?\n2. **Is there a way to enable \"real\" web browsing?** I want the model to actually visit the link and analyze the current page content. Are there specific functions, tools, or configurations in Open WebUI (like RAG settings) that allow Ollama models to access external websites?\n\nI'd love to hear how you guys handle web-based tasks with local LLMs. Thanks in advance!",

The AI does not read those files directly. Instead, a client tool extracts the text and sends it to the AI with an instruction to summarize.\n\nI think the WebUI uses the same techniques when it supports multiple models and some model can access or browse the internet content, some are not then process at the client side guarantee the client behave the same behavior with different AI models.\n\nDisclaimer: Askimo currently only reads the static HTML content.

This model should be more capable than `gemma3:1b`.\n\nI would suggest that you first try these models with `ollama run MODELNAME` and check to see how they fit in your VRAM (`ollama ps`) and check them for performance (`/set verbose`).\n\nWhat do you think?",

Ive been tinkering with local AI stuff for a while now.\n\nIm a single dad working full time, so my project time is scattered, but I finally got something to a point worth sharing.\n\nEmergentFlow is a node-based AI workflow builder, but architecturally different from tools like n8n, Flowise, or ComfyUI. Those all run server-side on their cloud or you self-host the backend.\n\n**EmergentFlow runs the execution engine in your browser.** Your browser tab is the runtime. When you connect Ollama, calls go directly from your browser to localhost:11434 (configurable). \n\nIt supports cloud APIs too (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) if you want to mix local + cloud in the same flow. There's a Browser Agent for autonomous research, RAG pipelines, database connectors, hardware control.\n\nBecause I want new users to experience the system, I have provided anonymous users without an account, 50 free credits using googles cloud API, these are simply to allow users to see the system in action before requiring they create an account.  \n\nTerrified of launching, be gentle.  \n\n[https://emergentflow.io/](https://emergentflow.io/)\n\nCreate visual flows directly from your browser.",

      "text": "Hi there, I'm interested how you guys set up ollama to work on tasks.\n\nThe first thing we already tried is having a Python script that calls the company internal Ollama via api with simple tasks in a loop. Imagine pseudocode:\n\n    for sourcecode in repository: \n      api-call-to-ollama(\"Please do a sourcecode review: \" + sourcecode)    \n\nWe tried multiple tasks like this for **multiple usecases, not just sourcecode reviews** and the intelligence is quite promising but ofc the context the LLMs have available to solve tasks like that limiting.\n\nSo the second idea is to somehow let the LLM make the decision what to include in a prompt. Let's call them \"pretasks\".\n\nThis pretask could be a prompt saying ´\"Write a prompt to an LLM to do a sourcecode review. You can decide to include adjacent PDFs, Jira tickets, pieces of sourcecode by writing <include:filename>\" + list-of-available-files-with-descriptions-what-they-are´. The python script would then parse the result of the pretask to collect the relevant files.\n\nThird and finally, at that point we could let the pretask trigger itself even more pretasks. This is where the thing would be almost bootstrapped. But I'm out of ideas how to coordinate this, prevent endless loops etc.\n\nSorry if my thoughts around this whole topic are a little scattered. I assume the whole world is right now thinking about these kinds of workflows. So I'd like to know where to start reading about it.",

I was looking into a server build, but with ram prices being what they are combined with gpus that would make the endeavour worth the squeeze, it's looking very expensive. \n\nWith a yearly cost of 250, is ollama cloud the best way to use these massive 235b+ models without forking over data to openai, anthropic, or google? The whole reason I started to use ollama was the data collection and spooky ammounts of knowledge that these commercial models can learn about you. Ollama cloud seems to have a very \"trust me bro\" approach to privacy in their resources, which only really say \"Ollama does not log prompt or response data\". I would trust them more than the frontier ai labs listed above, but I would like to see some evidence. If you do use ollama cloud, is it worth it? How do these massive models like mistral large 3 and the 235b parameter version of qwen 3 vl compare to the frontier models? \n\nTL;DR: Privacy policy nonexistent, but I need more vram",

      "text": "Just wanted to share a real-world use case for local LLMs. I’ve built a discovery engine called Project ARIS that uses Mistral Nemo as a reasoning layer for astronomical data.\n\nThe Stack:\n\nModel: Mistral Nemo 12B (Q4\\_K\\_M) running via Ollama.\n\nHardware: Lenovo Yoga 7 (Ryzen AI 7, 24GB RAM) on Nobara Linux.\n\nIntegration: Tauri/Rust backend calling the Ollama API.\n\nHow I’m using the LLM:\n\nContextual Memory: It reads previous session reports from a local folder and greets me with a verbal recap on boot.\n\nIntent Parsing: I built a custom terminal where Nemo translates \"fuzzy\" natural language into structured MAST API queries.\n\nAnomaly Scoring: It parses spectral data to flag \"out of the ordinary\" signatures that don't fit standard star/planet profiles.\n\nIt’s amazing how much a 12B model can do when given a specific toolset and a sandboxed terminal. Happy to answer any questions about the Rust/Ollama bridge!\n\n  \nA preview of Project ARIS can be found here:\n\n  \n[https://github.com/glowseedstudio/Project-ARIS](https://github.com/glowseedstudio/Project-ARIS)",

No tokens leave your machine, no API costs (unless you count electricity and emotional damage).\n\nSetup:\n\n`ollama pull llama3.2`\n\n`pip install evalview`\n\n`evalview chat --provider ollama --model llama3.2`\n\nWhat it does:\n\n\\- Runs your agent test suite + diffs against baselines\n\n\\- Grades outputs with the local model (LLM-as-judge)\n\n\\- Shows tool-call / latency / token (and cost estimate) diffs between runs\n\n\\- Lets you drill into failures conversationally\n\nRepo:\n\n[https://github.com/hidai25/eval-view](https://github.com/hidai25/eval-view)\n\nQuestion for the Ollama crowd:\n\nWhat models have you found work well for \"reasoning about agent behavior\" and judging tool calls?\n\nI’ve been using llama3.2 but I’m curious if mistral or deepseek-coder style models do better for tool-use grading.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI’m currently evaluating **Ollama Cloud models** and would appreciate some clarification regarding **usage limits on paid plans**.\n\nI’m interested in running the following cloud models via Ollama:\n\n* `ollama run gemini-3-flash-preview:cloud`\n* `ollama run deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud`\n* `ollama run gemini-3-pro-preview`\n* `ollama run kimi-k2:1t-cloud`\n\n# My use case\n\n* Daily content generation: **\\~5–10 million tokens per day**\n* Number of prompt submissions: **\\~1,000–2,000 per day**\n* Average prompt size: **\\~2,500 tokens**\n* Responses can be long (multi-thousand tokens)\n\n# Questions\n\n1. Do the **paid Ollama plans** support this level of token throughput (5–10M tokens/day)?\n2. Are there **hard daily or monthly token caps** per model or per account?\n3. How are **API requests counted** internally by Ollama for each prompt/response cycle?\n4. Does a single `ollama run` execution map to **one API request**, or can it generate multiple internal calls depending on response length?\n5. Are there **per-model limitations** (rate limits, concurrency, max tokens) for large cloud models like DeepSeek 671B or Kimi-K2 1T?\n\nI’m trying to determine whether the current **paid offering can reliably sustain this workload** or if additional arrangements (enterprise plans, quotas, etc.) are required.\n\nAny insights from the Ollama team or experienced users running high-volume workloads would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you!",

Sharing results in case they’re helpful for anyone considering this board for local LLM inference. One important note is that the official Radxa Debian 12 image for the Orion O6 only ships with a desktop environment. For these tests, I removed the desktop and ran the system headless, which helped reduce background load and thermals.\n\n# Hardware / Setup\n\n* Radxa Orion O6\n* 64 GB RAM\n* Powered over USB-C PD\n* Radxa AI Kit case (this significantly improved thermals)\n* Debian 12 (official Radxa image, desktop removed → headless)\n* Ollama (CPU-only)\n* CPU governor: `schedutil` (performed better than forcing `performance`)\n* Adequate cooling and airflow (critical on this board)\n\n# Results (tokens/sec = eval rate)\n\n**Qwen3-Next**\n\n* Eval rate: **2.41 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 1203\n* Total time: \\~8m25s\n\n**Nemotron-3-nano**\n\n* Eval rate: **6.04 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 836\n* Total time: \\~2m21s\n\n**Qwen3:30B (MoE)**\n\n* Eval rate: **6.42 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 709\n* Total time: \\~1m52s\n\n**Qwen3:30B-Instruct (MoE)**\n\n* Eval rate: 6.81 **tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 148\n* Total time: \\~23s\n\n**Qwen3:14B (dense)**\n\n* Eval rate: **3.66 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 328\n* Total time: \\~1m33s\n\n**GPT-OSS**\n\n* Eval rate: **3.01 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 543\n* Total time: \\~3m09s\n\n**Llama3:8B**\n\n* Eval rate: **6.42 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 273\n* Total time: \\~45s\n\n**DeepSeek-R1:1.5B**\n\n* Eval rate: **19.57 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 44\n* Total time: \\~2.7s\n\n**Granite 3.1 MoE (3B)**\n\n* Eval rate: **17.87 tok/s**\n* Eval tokens: 66\n* Total time: \\~4.8s\n\n# Observations\n\n* 30B-class models *do* run on the Orion O6 — slow, but usable for experimentation.\n* Larger models (8B–30B) cluster around \\~3–6 tok/s, suggesting a memory-bandwidth / ARM CPU ceiling, not a power or clock issue.\n* Smaller models (Granite 3B, DeepSeek 1.5B) feel very responsive.\n* schedutil governor consistently outperformed performance in testing.\n* Thermals matter a lot: moving to the Radxa AI Kit case and running headless eliminated thermal shutdowns seen earlier.\n* USB-C PD has been stable so far with adequate cooling.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nThe Orion O6 isn’t a GPU replacement, but as a compact ARM server with 64 GB RAM that can genuinely run 30B MoE models, it exceeded my expectations. Running Debian headless and using the AI Kit case makes a real difference. With realistic performance expectations, it’s a solid platform for local LLM experimentation.\n\nHappy to answer questions or run additional tests if people are interested.\n\n\n\n# Update\n\nI was able to slightly increase perform by making a few more tweaks.  \n1.  Changed CPU Governor to ondemand  \n2.  Pruned Unnecessary background services (isp\\_app, avahi-daemon, cups, fwupd, upower, etc.)  \n3.  OLLAMA_SCHED_SPREAD=false\n\nFor Qwen3:30b-instruct, this boosted performance from \\~6.8t/s to \\~7.4t/s",

The confidence scoring in your prompt template is smart, especially for enterprise use where wrong answers are expensive.\n\nFor enterprise deployment, most companies I've seen go bigger on hardware and add more guardrails. They'll run 70B models on multi-GPU setups rather than 8B, and they obsess over data governance. Who can access what documents, audit trails, that kind of thing.\n\nThe inconsistent RAG answers you're getting are probably from chunking issues rather than the model itself. When you converted those invoices to markdown, did you check what the actual chunks look like after processing? Sometimes invoice tables get mangled during conversion and the model gets garbage input. Even with your confidence scoring, it can't fix upstream data problems.\n\nEnterprise teams usually spend more time on the document processing pipeline than the model selection. They'll have dedicated teams just for parsing financial documents, making sure entities like amounts and dates are extracted correctly.\n\nWhat kind of inconsistencies are you seeing in the RAG responses? Are they factual errors or more like incomplete information?",

I provide only high-level direction and it develops a plan, assigns and delegates tasks, saves output, and gets back to me. \n\nI was able to get this working in self-developed code and Microsoft Agent Framework, both accessing Ollama, but the results are... interesting. The manager would delegate a task to the researcher, who would search and provide feedback, but then the manager would completely hallucinate actually saving the data. (It seems to me to be a model limitation issue, mostly, but I'm developing a new testing method that takes tool usage into account and will test all my local models again to see if I get better results with a different one.)\n\nI'd like to use Claude Code or systems due to their better models, but they're all severely limited (Claude can't create agents on-the-fly, etc.) or very costly. \n\nHas anyone actually accomplished something like this locally that actually works semi-decently? How do your agents interact? How did you fix tool usage? What models? Etc.\n\nThanks!",
