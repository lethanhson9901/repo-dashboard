      "text": "I have a MacBook Air with 24gb ram (M2) and when I set the context to 32k I can really do about everything I want a local model to do for normal business stuff. Tokens/sec is about 15 at medium reasoning, (update: 21.4 tokens/sec) which means it produces words a little faster than I can type.\n\nI also tested on an older Linux machine with 64gb ram and a GTX gpu with 8gb vram and it worked fine doing batch processing overnight (update: 9 tokens/sec). A little too slow for interactive use though.\n\n* Scripting - yes\n* Calling tools - yes\n* Summarizing long content - yes\n* Writing content - yes\n\nHere’s how I used it:\n\nCreate a file named `Modelfile-agent-gpt-oss-20b` and put the following in it\n\n—\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    # 1. Hardware-Aware Context\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 32768\n    # 2. Anti-Loop Parameters\n    # Penalize repeated tokens and force variety in phrasing\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    PARAMETER repeat_last_n 128\n    # Temperature at 0.1 makes it more deterministic (less 'drifting' into loops)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    # Performance improvements for M2 cpu\n    PARAMETER num_batch 512 \n    PARAMETER num_thread 8 \n    # 3. Agentic Steering\n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent.\n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters.\n    If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    Every <thought> must provide NEW information.\n    Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\nUpdate: And for the cpu+gtx combo:\n\n    FROM gpt-oss:20b\n    \n    # 1. REMOVE the hard num_gpu 99 to prevent the crash.\n    # Instead, we let Ollama auto-calculate the split.\n    # To encourage GPU use, we shrink the \"Memory Tax\" (Context).\n    PARAMETER num_ctx 4096\n    \n    # 2. REMOVE f16_kv to stop the warning.\n    # Ollama will handle this automatically for your GTX 1070.\n    \n    # 3. CPU OPTIMIZATION\n    # Since 40% of the model is on your i5, we must optimize the CPU side.\n    PARAMETER num_thread 4\n    \n    # 4. AGENTIC STEERING (Keep your original logic)\n    PARAMETER temperature 0.1\n    PARAMETER repeat_penalty 1.2\n    \n    SYSTEM \"\"\"\n    You are a 'one-shot' execution agent. \n    To prevent reasoning loops, follow these strict rules:\n    1. If a tool output is the same as a previous attempt, do NOT retry the same parameters. \n    2. If you are stuck, state 'I am unable to progress with the current toolset' and stop.\n    3. Every <thought> must provide NEW information. \n    4. Do not repeat the user's instructions back to them.\n    5. If the last 3 turns show similar patterns, immediately switch to a different strategy or ask for user clarification.\n    \"\"\"\n\n—\n\nAt the terminal type:\n\n`ollama create gpt-oss-agent -f Modelfile-aget-gpt-oss-20b`\n\nNow you can use the model “gpt-oss-agent” like you would any other model.\n\nI used opencode using this command:\n\n`ollama launch opencode --model gpt-oss-agent`\n\nThat let me do Claude-code style activities bough Claude is way more capable.\n\nWith a bunch of browser tabs open and a few apps I was using about 22gb of ram and 3gb of swap. During longer activities using other apps was laggy but usable.\n\nOn my computer I use for batch tasks I have python scripts that use the ollama python library. I use a tool like Claude code to create the script.\n\nI’m a lawyer and use this for processing lots of documents. Sorting them, looking for interesting information, cataloging them. There are a lot of great models for this. But with this model I was able to produce better output.\n\nAlso, I can run tools. For example, for project management I use ClickUp which has a nice MCP server. I set it up with:\n\n`opencode mcp add`\n\nThen put in the url and follow the instructions. Since that mcp server requires authentication I use this:\n\n`opencode mcp auth ClickUp`\n\nThen again follow the instructions.\n\n\\*\\*Edit: Fixed terrible formatting  \n\\*\\*Edit2: Updated modelfile to get better performance  \n\\*\\*Edit3: Added details about CPU+GTX combination - thank you to Gemini for talking me through how to optimize this, details on how I did that below in the comments.",

It's still a little too slow for interactive use, but overall, I'm very impressed with that speed. And the quality of this model is very nice.\n\nTo come up with those parameters I asked Gemini for help. It asked me to start a long prompt and then I ran \\`ollama ps\\` and it showed me that 53% was running on the gpu and 47% on the cpu. Running (on Linux) \\`journalctl -u ollama --no-pager | grep \"offload\"\\` showed that 15 of the 25 layers were offloaded to the GPU. \n\nNote that the threads is 4 because I have a 4 core CPU.\n\nFor reference, I have a 7th gen i5 and a GTX 1070 with 8GB of vram.

It offers a polished desktop experience for chatting with local LLMs, managing models, analyzing files and images, and monitoring system usage in real time.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Clean chat UI with full Markdown, code, tables, and math\n* Built-in model management (pull / delete / switch)\n* Vision + PDF / text file analysis (drag & drop)\n* AppImage distribution (download & run)\n\nBuilt with **Tauri v2 (Rust) + React + TypeScript**.\n\nFeedback and technical criticism are very welcome.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie](https://github.com/MedGm/Ollie)",

Having one agent that handles all of that is clean.\n\nA few questions/suggestions if you keep building on it:\n\n- How does it handle failures? Like if a website check times out, does it retry or just flag it?\n- For the reminder system, does it persist across restarts? That was one of the first things I had to solve with my own setup.\n- Have you thought about adding a simple web dashboard to see all your monitors at a glance?\n\nNice work for a personal project.

Many models are successful in find the needle in haystack kind of tasks but fail when asked to retrieve multiple entries from context (kind of reasoning over haystack). In this kind scenarios models often just miss data or start to hallucinate especially in the middle of the context. Best results with reasonable speed I have gained with Ministral-3-14B-Reasoning with Q6_K quant (8B with Q8_0 provide almost equal results), Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus Q4_K_M and gpt-oss-20B Q4_K_M. Qwen-3-30B does good job but is really slow as it needs offloading and still with limited context.\n\nFor testing I wrote a small Python program which generates log file of specified size with known information spread in the logs. \n\nIf anyone have good suggestions, please let me know.",

      "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI‘m looking into options to get local AI running for my company.\n\nWe do technical consulting and love to use AI for skimming through technical documents and pinpointing information down.\n\nWe are burning through Tokens and I‘m trying to save us some money but having local AI would actually allow us to use it on sensible data. Not all our customers allow cloud based AI assistance, because even when the providers say they don’t train / store data, we cannot be certain.\n\nWhat do we want to do?\n\nI envision a paperless-ngx instance where we can upload a shitton of unsorted / unknown data. We have a solid promt\n\nThat categorizes the data and indexes the files. Allocates it to the right customer / project. And makes it accessible, searchable and tags them according to our need.\n\nRight now we use cloud providers to do this, but as I mentioned before we are burning through tokens. Especially in the beginning of projects when we digitalize a wheelbarrow full of hard copies folders.\n\nMy colleague said we should just buy a Mac mini and use that as an Ollama host, but I hate Apple with a passion (while writing this on an iPhone…).\n\nI was looking at the Minisforum MS-S1 Max, hardware looks promising. I want to run Proxmox PVE 9 on it, then pass the GPU to the LXC where Ollama will reside.\n\nIs this a viable path? \n\nMy calculation is, if we spent 500€ on Tokens per month, and we can save half of that with this device, it would basically pay itself off within a year. And looking back at the last 12 months, I can see a steady increase in tokens for us. While enabling us to also process highly sensible data with AI.\n\nWhat models can I realistically run on this hardware? I was thinking something like Llama4:Maverik will probably work for us.\n\nWould you guys maybe recommend a different model for our „background“ usecase? Are there other ways to streamline our workflow maybe?\n\nTo be fair I don’t want to get rid of all cloud AI, as I fully understand that their models will always be more sophisticated and faster.\n\nLooking forward for you comments!",

Basically it will scan your documents, cut them into chunks, size at your leisure, run a search which ones apply to your question, and only put those into context. With such large PDFs you’d have to play around with a little setting called TopK inside the „documents“ settings, setting it very high. It sets how many of those chunks are loaded each time, depending on relevance.\n\nI’m pretty sure openwebui is not state of the art anymore, but it’s been working well and is quite flexible.",

      "text": "    # 🎮 88% Success Rate with qwen2.5-coder:7b on RTX 3060 Ti - My Journey Building an AI Agent Orchestrator\n    \n    \n    **TL;DR:**\n     Built a tiered AI agent system where Ollama handles 88% of tasks for FREE, with automatic escalation to Claude for complex work. Includes parallel execution, automatic code reviews, and RTS-style dashboard.\n    \n    \n    ## Why This Matters for \n    \n    \n    After months of testing, I've proven that \n    **local models can handle real production workloads**\n     with the right architecture. Here's the breakdown:\n    \n    \n    ### The Setup\n    - \n    **Hardware:**\n     RTX 3060 Ti (8GB VRAM)\n    - \n    **Model:**\n     qwen2.5-coder:7b (4.7GB)\n    - \n    **Temperature:**\n     0 (critical for tool calling!)\n    - \n    **Context Management:**\n     3s rest between tasks + 8s every 5 tasks\n    \n    \n    ### The Results (40-Task Stress Test)\n    - \n    **C1-C8 tasks: 100% success**\n     (20/20)\n    - \n    **C9 tasks: 80% success**\n     (LeetCode medium, class implementations)\n    - \n    **Overall: 88% success**\n     (35/40 tasks)\n    - \n    **Average execution: 0.88 seconds**\n    \n    \n    ### What Works\n    ✅ File I/O operations\n    ✅ Algorithm implementations (merge sort, binary search)\n    ✅ Class implementations (Stack, RPN Calculator)\n    ✅ LeetCode Medium (LRU Cache!)\n    ✅ Data structure operations\n    \n    \n    ### The Secret Sauce\n    \n    \n    **1. Temperature 0**\n    This was the game-changer. T=0.7 → model outputs code directly. T=0 → reliable tool calling.\n    \n    \n    **2. Rest Between Tasks**\n    Context pollution is real! Without rest: 85% success. With rest: 100% success (C1-C8).\n    \n    \n    **3. Agent Persona (\"CodeX-7\")**\n    Gave the model an elite agent identity with mission examples. Completion rates jumped significantly. Agents need personality!\n    \n    \n    **4. Stay in VRAM**\n    Tested 14B model → CPU offload → 40% pass rate\n    7B model fully in VRAM → 88-100% pass rate\n    \n    \n    **5. Smart Escalation**\n    Tasks that fail escalate to Claude automatically. Best of both worlds.\n    \n    \n    ### The Architecture\n    \n    \n    ```\n    Task Queue → Complexity Router → Resource Pool\n                         ↓\n        ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐\n        ↓              ↓              ↓\n      Ollama        Haiku          Sonnet\n      (C1-6)        (C7-8)         (C9-10)\n       FREE!        $0.003         $0.01\n        ↓              ↓              ↓\n             Automatic Code Reviews\n        (Haiku every 5th, Opus every 10th)\n    ```\n    \n    \n    ### Cost Comparison (10-task batch)\n    - \n    **All Claude Opus:**\n     ~$15\n    - \n    **Tiered (mostly Ollama):**\n     ~$1.50\n    - \n    **Savings:**\n     90%\n    \n    \n    ### GitHub\n    https://github.com/mrdushidush/agent-battle-command-center\n    \n    \n    Full Docker setup, just needs Ollama + optional Claude API for fallback.\n    \n    \n    ## Questions for the Community\n    \n    \n    1. \n    **Has anyone else tested qwen2.5-coder:7b for production?**\n     How do your results compare?\n    2. \n    **What's your sweet spot for VRAM vs model size?**\n     \n    3. \n    **Agent personas - placebo or real?**\n     My tests suggest real improvement but could be confirmation bias.\n    4. \n    **Other models?**\n     Considering DeepSeek Coder v2 next.\n    \n    \n    ---\n    \n    \n    **Stack:**\n     TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, CrewAI, Ollama, Docker\n    **Status:**\n     Production ready, all tests passing\n    \n    \n    Let me know if you want me to share the full prompt engineering approach or stress test methodology!",

No point burning API costs on simple classification or extraction when a 7B model handles it fine.\n\nOne thing that bit me building something similar, the data feeding step. If your agents need to pull web data as part of their task chain, the scraping reliability becomes the bottleneck, not the model. A failed scrape that returns a Cloudflare challenge page instead of actual content will cascade through the whole agent chain and waste all the downstream LLM calls.\n\nEnded up separating the data acquisition step entirely, validate that you got real content before passing it into the agent pipeline. Saves a lot of wasted compute on retries.",

With 1.7.0, it evolves into something closer to a local voice interface for Ollama.\n\n# Main Ollama-related features\n\n# 1. LLM Connect\n\nDirect integration with Ollama to process transcribed voice input using ollama local models.\n\n# 2. Voice commands\n\nSelect text → speak an instruction → Ollama transforms it in background.\n\nExamples:\n\n* \"Correct this text\"\n* \"Rewrite this more concisely\"\n* \"Translate to English\"\n* \"Turn this into bullet points\"\n* ...\n\nEverything runs locally, completely free, fully offline, open source, no tracking, no telemtry, no bullshit.\n\nIt currently supports 25 European languages.\n\nI’m not making any money from this, just building something I wanted for myself and sharing it.\n\nFeedback from Ollama users would be very welcome.\n\n* Official website: [https://murmure.al1x-ai.com/](https://murmure.al1x-ai.com/)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure](https://github.com/Kieirra/murmure)",

Help me choose the best model for text summarization and writing documentation based on code please.\n\n**Specs:**\n\n* Hetzner [AX102](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ax102/)\n* Ryzen 7950X3D processor with 16 vCPU\n* 96MB 3D V-Cache\n* 192 GB DDR5 RAM.\n* No GPU.\n\n**Use case:** AI agent (OpenClaw) orchestrated via n8n, heavy on tool calling / function calling. Needs 40K+ context window. Not doing chat — it's purely agentic workflows.\n\n**What I've tried so far:**\n\n* `qwen3:32b` (dense) — painfully slow on CPU, unusable\n* `qwen3:30b-a3b-q8_0` (MoE) — much faster, works well, decent tool calling\n* `gpt-oss:20b` (MoE, MXFP4) — noticeably faster than Qwen3-30B, lightest memory footprint (\\~12-16GB). Impressed so far.\n\n**Now considering:**\n\n* **GPT-OSS 20B** — 21B/3.6B active, MXFP4 native, \\~12-16GB RAM. Lightest option. Built-in tool calling. Concerned about the harmony format playing nice with n8n.\n* **GLM-4.7-Flash** — 30B/3B active, 128K context, best SWE-bench scores. Saw reports of Ollama template issues — is that fixed?\n* **Sticking with Qwen3-30B-A3B** but Q4\\_K\\_M \n\n  \nI haven't tried any of them yet with OpenClaw or n8n.\n\nWhat are your recommendations ?",

      "text": "So I worked with Ollama a year or so ago, and I remained with a great impression. When I picked my work back up for professional reasons, I saw they launched a cloud service!\n\nI decided to try out the 20 USD/month cloud plan, but my usage was filling up.   \nWeirdly enough, I could not find an exact max token count on their website, only percentages for usages in a 4 hour session and a weekly session.\n\nI got the most expensive plan ( 100 USD/month ) to try to solve that issue. \n\n\\*\\*However\\*\\* I also decided to email Ollama's support team to inquire about the specific limitations-- what the max number of tokens is, etc.   \nThis is their response:\n\n\"We've designed our plans around use case intensity rather than hard token caps. The free tier is for light experimentation. Pro is built for day-to-day work like chat, document analysis, and coding assistance. Max is for heavier usage including coding agents and batch processing. These plans aren't currently designed for sustained production API usage—if that's what you're looking for, I'd love to hear more about your specific use case so we can factor it into future plans.\"\n\nWhat is this??? Their limitations are defined by \"light experimentation\", \"day-to-day work\" and \"heavier usage\"???  \nHas Ollama really degraded that much? I was eager to support them financially but what I recieved is a little dissapointing....",
