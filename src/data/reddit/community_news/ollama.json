      "text": "Hey fellow Ollama fans, I'm delighted that image generation is available so I have written a web app you can run on your own computer (alongside Ollama) to make it easier to generate, save and delete images.\n\nOK it ain't no ComfyUI but makes things tidier and, unlike using the terminal Ollama CLI, images don't clutter up your home folder!  \nRepo at [https://github.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator](https://github.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator)\n\n... but all you really need to download is:\n\n* [**server.py**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator/refs/heads/main/server.py) \\- small proxying server which you can run without extra packages on your machine as long as you have python 3.9 or higher. No need for a venv as I've just used built-in packages like *http.server* \\- run from terminal as ***python3*** [***server.py***](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator/refs/heads/main/server.py)\n* [index.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator/refs/heads/main/index.html) \\- does all the grunt work in your web browser on port 8080. Generated images are saved to local storage along with generation settings, and can be deleted individually. Once [server.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator/refs/heads/main/server.py) is up and running, take your web browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n\n[README.md](https://github.com/nicklansley/OllamaImageGenerator/blob/main/README.md) gives more info but quick instructions:\n\n* Download an image generation model in terminal - currently '***ollama pull x/z-image-turbo:bf16***' and '***ollama pull x/flux2-klein:latest***' are supported.\n* Type a prompt, set image width and height, choose a seed and the number of steps, then click 'Generate Image'.\n* During image progression, a 'step N of X' message appears to denote progress.\n* Images are saved to a side panel (actually they are in localStorage so they survive from one session to the next).\n* Save an image onto your machine with right-click 'Save Image As..' or drag if out of the main window and into a folder.\n* Double click a saved image to move it to the main window along with the settings that created it (the image can be recreated as long as seed 0 (Ollama internal random seed) was not used.\n* Single click an image then click 'x' to delete it. The image is removed from the image list saved in localStorage.\n\nWhen more image models become available:\n\n* Download a model with 'image pull image\\_gen\\_model\\_name:tag'\n* Update image list variable IMAGE\\_GEN\\_MODEL\\_LIST with the same model name and tag at the top of index.html\n\n[Screenshot of Ollama Image Generator](https://preview.redd.it/n8kap3a823fg1.png?width=1369&format=png&auto=webp&s=accb2258e20e62c356823ad8b85439aab8424f4a)",

      "text": "Hi r/ollama,\n\nI've been working on an open-source tool called **GrepAI**, and I wanted to share it here because it relies heavily on **Ollama** to function.\n\n**What is it?** GrepAI is a CLI tool (written in Go) designed to help AI agents (like Claude Code, Cursor, or local agents) understand your codebase better.\n\nInstead of using standard regex `grep` to find code—which often misses the context—GrepAI uses **Ollama** to generate local embeddings of your code. This allows you to perform **semantic searches** directly from the terminal.\n\n**The Stack:**\n\n* **Core:** Written in Go.\n* **Embeddings:** Connects to your local Ollama instance (defaults to `nomic-embed-text`).\n* **Vector Store:** In-memory / Local (fast and private).\n\n**Why use Ollama for this?** I wanted a solution that respects privacy and doesn't cost a fortune in API credits just to index a repo. By using Ollama locally, GrepAI builds an index of your project (respecting `.gitignore`) without your code leaving your machine.\n\n**Real-world Impact (Benchmark)** I tested this setup by using GrepAI as a filter for Claude Code (instead of the default grep). The idea was to let Ollama decide what files were relevant before sending them to the cloud. The results were huge:\n\n* **-97% Input Tokens** sent to the LLM (because Ollama filtered the noise).\n* **-27.5% Cost reduction** on the task.\n\nEven if you don't use Claude, this demonstrates how effective local embeddings (via Ollama) are at retrieving the right context for RAG applications.\n\n👉 **Benchmark details:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/blog/benchmark-grepai-vs-grep-claude-code/)\n\n**Links:**\n\n* 📦 **GitHub:**[https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai](https://github.com/yoanbernabeu/grepai)\n* 📚 **Docs:**[https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/](https://yoanbernabeu.github.io/grepai/)\n\nI'd love to know what other embedding models you guys are running with Ollama. Currently, `nomic-embed-text` gives me the best results for code, but I'm open to suggestions!",

      "text": "I spent last weekend building something I had been thinking about for a while. Claude Cowork is great, but I wanted an open-source, lightweight version that could run with any model, so I created Open Cowork.\n\nIt's written entirely in Rust, which I had never used before. Starting from scratch meant no heavy dependencies, no Python bloat, and no reliance on existing agent SDKs. Just a tiny, fast binary that works anywhere.\n\nSecurity was a big concern since the agents can execute code. Open Cowork handles this by running tasks inside temporary Docker containers. Everything stays isolated, but you can still experiment freely.\n\nYou can plug in any model you want. OpenAI, Anthropic, or even fully offline LLMs through Ollama are all supported. You keep full control over your API keys and your data.\n\nIt already comes with built-in skills for handling documents like PDFs and Excel files. I was surprised by how useful it became right away.\n\nThe development experience was wild. An AI agent helped me build a secure, open-source version of itself, and I learned Rust along the way. It was one of those projects where everything just clicked together in a weekend.\n\nThe code is live on GitHub: [https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse\\_cowork](https://github.com/kuse-ai/kuse_cowork) . It's still early, but I'd love to hear feedback from anyone who wants to try it out or contribute.",
