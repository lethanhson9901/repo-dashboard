Resource cost wise it's one clunky robot with a short range or a small fleet of exploding drones with huge range and the ability to fly.\n  \nThough I assume there's underground bases in China and the US dedicated to producing and testing military applications, especially for tunnel fighting and urban combat and mapping. My guess is that they're actually more useful in tasks like assembling and deploying hardware like artillery than as foot soldiers because they can be near a stable source of power and always ready - plus updating their procedure for new equipment is much quicker and easier than retraining humans. \n\nInstead of driving an APC and the equipment into the field a truck with the hardware and robots could take it's place - maybe even positioned in ways humans wouldn't be able to handle like a hard landing into water. Once positioned they rapidly assemble the equipment, this can be a much more complex process than current military machinery because training people on overly complex things isn't always possible but in software it can be done in the r&d department and copied onto any device that needs it. \n\nThat of course only if it hasn't entirely moved to drone swarms by that point, we could get to the point where control of the skies is pretty much all that actually matters.",

      "text": "So this whole thing is actually wild when you know the full story.\n\nIt was the time 30th November 2022, when OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world for the very first time. Goes viral instantly. 1 million users in 5 days. 100 million in 2 months. Fastest growing platform in history.\n\nThat launch was a wake-up call for the entire tech industry. Google, the long-time torchbearer of AI, suddenly found itself playing catch-up with, as CEO Sundar Pichai described it, “this little company in San Francisco called OpenAI” that had come out swinging with “this product ChatGPT.”\n\nTurns out, Google already had its own chatbot called LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications). A conversational AI chatbot, quietly waiting in the wings. Pichai later revealed that it was ready, and could’ve launched months before ChatGPT. As he said himself - “We knew in a different world, we would've probably launched our chatbot maybe a few months down the line.”\n\nSo why didn't they?   \n  \nReputational risk. Google was terrified of what might happen if they released a chatbot that gave wrong answers. Or said something racist. Or spread misinformation. Their whole business is built on trust. Search results people can rely on. If they released something that confidently spewed BS it could damage the brand. So they held back. Kept testing. Wanted it perfect before releasing to the public. Then ChatGPT dropped and changed everything.\n\nThree weeks after ChatGPT launched, things had started to change, Google management declares \"Code Red.\" For Google this is like pulling the fire alarm. All hands on deck. The New York Times got internal memos and audio recordings. Sundar Pichai upended the work of numerous groups inside the company. Teams in Research Trust and Safety and other departments got reassigned. Everyone now working on AI.\n\nThey even brought in the founders. Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Both had stepped back from day to day operations years ago. Now they're in emergency meetings discussing how to respond to ChatGPT. One investor who oversaw Google's ad team from 2013 to 2018 said ChatGPT could prevent users from clicking on Google links with ads. That's a problem because ads generated $208 billion in 2021. 81% of Alphabet's revenue.\n\nPichai said \"For me when ChatGPT launched contrary to what people outside felt I was excited because I knew the window had shifted.\" \n\nWhile all this was happening, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave an interview after investing $10 billion in OpenAI, calling Google the “800-pound gorilla” and saying: \"With our innovation, they will definitely want to come out and show that they can dance. And I want people to know that we made them dance.\"\n\nSo Google panicked. Spent months being super careful then suddenly had to rush everything out in weeks.\n\nFebruary 6 2023. They announce Bard. Their ChatGPT competitor. They make a demo video showing it off. Someone asks Bard \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?\" Bard answers with some facts including \"JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\"\n\nThat's completely wrong. The first exoplanet picture was from 2004. James Webb launched in 2021. You could literally Google this to check. The irony is brutal. The company that made Google couldn't fact check their own AI's first public answer.\n\nTwo days later they hold this big launch event in Paris. Hours before the event Reuters reports on the Bard error. Goes viral immediately.\n\nThat same day Google's stock tanks. Drops 9%. $100 billion gone. In one day. Because their AI chatbot got one fact wrong in a demo video. Next day it drops another 5%. Total loss over $160 billion in two days. Microsoft's stock went up 3% during this.\n\nWhat gets me is Google was actually right to be cautious. ChatGPT does make mistakes all the time. Hallucinates facts. Can't verify what it's saying. But OpenAI just launched it anyway as an experiment and let millions of people test it. Google wanted it perfect. But trying to avoid damage from an imperfect product they rushed out something broken and did way more damage.\n\nA former Google employee told Fox Business that after the Code Red meeting execs basically said screw it we gotta ship. Said they abandoned their AI safety review process. Took shortcuts. Just had to get something out there. So they spent months worried about reputation then threw all caution out when competitors forced their hand.\n\nBard eventually became Gemini and it's actually pretty good now. But that initial disaster showed even Google with all their money and AI research can get caught sleeping.\n\nThe whole situation is wild. They hesitated for a few months and it cost them $160 billion and their lead in AI. But also rushing made it worse. Both approaches failed. Meanwhile OpenAI's \"launch fast and fix publicly\" worked. Microsoft just backed them and integrated the tech without taking the risk themselves.\n\n**TLDR**  \n  \nGoogle had chatbot ready before ChatGPT. Didn't launch because scared of reputation damage. ChatGPT went viral Nov 2022. Google called Code Red Dec 2022. Brought back founders for emergency meetings. Rushed Bard launch Feb 2023. First demo had wrong fact about space telescope. Stock dropped 9% lost $100B in one day. Dropped another 5% next day. $160B gone total. Former employee says they abandoned safety process to catch up. Being too careful cost them the lead then rushing cost them even more.\n\nSources - \n\n[https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99](https://www.thebridgechronicle.com/tech/sundar-pichai-google-chatgpt-ai-openai-first-mp99)\n\n[https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-bard-ai-chatbot-not-ready-alphabet-hennessy-chatgpt-competitor-2023-2)",

I don't buy that it was \"perfection\" driving the choices here, kind of a convenient narrative for Google: \"We were so far ahead, but we are so responsible, and just frankly, too obsessed with perfection\"...

The whole Sushi - Japan + Germany = Bratwurst example. The problem is that it doesn’t take a lot of bad data to pollute an embedding. So if you imagine a ChatGPT that is trained entirely on Reddit, it will struggle to logically determine if Rent Control will have positive or negative outcomes because the training data will have a lot of very different answers, reducing the correlation between the policy and the outcome, even though the science is pretty clear on the matter.\n\nEven with the shortcomings in training data today, ChatGPT will apply a specific policy to a specific fact set (say, does an insurance policy cover a specific loss) much more accurately and explain its reasoning much more clearly than the average person. ",

At some point you may even choose a synopsis that sounds uninteresting, but is from a film that's human-analog, rather than just another super cool awesome wow AI drop in the ocean. Maybe similar to the difference in choosing an indie film vs another Marvel movie.\n\nMedia has some sway at manipulating what people's tastes are, I guess, by brute forcing particular ways of doing things. But they aren't literal magicians. That sway only goes so far. I'm not sure they're gonna convince everyone that AI gen is the only way forward (just so that they can save money). I think if people don't realize it now, they'll realize it when they're head deep in AI slop that they don't care nearly as much for it as something human crafted.\n\nIf so, in that world, any media company going back to human craft is gonna monopolize interest. Everyone else is gonna have to backtrack to still compete. It won't matter what they want, it'll matter what people want.\n\nPersonally I don't mind too much about stuff like motion capture (though I prefer pure animation more, as *it's more impressive due to requiring more effort/skill, resulting in more admiration for the art*--btw this is an important formula IMO, js). But motion capture still requires humans doing something, which is a craft, which has *some* level of admiration, resulting in *some* artistic value. Whereas AI gen is just... categorically something *else* entirely. Does anyone ever look at a prompt and go \"wow the artistry here is amazing, this is incredible!\" Does anyone here really think most people will get there in a way that's similar to motion capture? I personally don't, but maybe I'm stubborn.",

Maybe certain models will be too large (before GGUF/quant) to run on your specific GPU, but at least you're not completely gated by having yet another package or app getting around to support for models that fit immediately.\n\nMany models are delivered already in huggingface transformers or diffusers packages so you don't even need to git clone. You just need to setup a env, install a couple packages, then copy/paste a code snippet from the model page. This often takes a total of 15-60 seconds depending on how fast your internet connection is and how big the model is.\n\nOn /r/stablediffusion everyone just throws their hands up if there's no comfyui support, and here it's more typically llama.cpp/gguf, but you don't need to wait if you know some basics.",

In the earliest stage, the dominant players in China's AI landscape were conventional internet companies like Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance. These companies largely promoted closed-source models and paid AI services, with Baidu's Ernie Bot being the representative model of this phase. Then, as Baidu was quickly phased out, China's AI companies entered a competitive stage similar to the current AI market in the United States, characterized by competition through paid services and investments, with ByteDance's DreamVerse being the representative of this period. After that, DeepSeek upended the game. In fact, the current trend toward open-source AI in China is largely a result of DeepSeek's disruptive move. Rather than being a conspiracy orchestrated by CCP, open-source is more about DeepSeek, as a leader in the new era, shifting the market's direction.",

We depend on a boutique database startup that allows us to do things that we couldn't do with established SQL/noSQL tech, but they're too small to be multi-region/multi-cloud. Presumably the people who depend on our service are saying exactly the same thing about us.",

Obviously, no slash commands (yet?). \n3. No MCP yet. \n4. It doesn't provide any information about token usage per message like the CLI does yet. \n5. It's quick. \n6. The web interface is very aesthetically pleasing, and quite minimal. I like the way it shows CLI actions like file-reads. It's clear and doesn't get in the way. \n7. You can't specify files yet (like from your repo). \n\nSo far, it looks like a solid start, very interested to see where it will go. In particular, it would be just a nice QoL feature to have a continuously running CC instance that I can just connect to and disconnect from using a web browser. I know you can achieve the same thing with Claude Code and ssh/tmux! But it is nice that this is an option :)",

Same thing with new ideas, just write a query for a new idea you came up with at the grocery store. When you come home you can pull down all the branches to double check the work and make adjustments. At any given moment I usually have a dozen Codex prompts going and then I’ll actively be working on one with Claude Code on my laptop. It’s much easier than having to branch off and it allows you to develop new ideas and fix small issues when you’re not next to your laptop. ",

It seems that they maintained access to DynamoDB in their region, so they could resolve access to resources in us-east-1.\n\nThese are just pieces I put together, we need to wait for proper postmortem analysis.",

              "text": "They can for some problems \n\nGemini 2.5 Deep Think solves previously unproven mathematical conjecture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoXRfTb7ves\n\n\nThe first non trivial research mathematics proof done by AI: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23758\n\n>The one-dimensional J1-J2 q-state Potts model is solved exactly for arbitrary qby introducing the maximally\nsymmetric subspace (MSS) method to analytically block diagonalize the q2 ×q2 transfer matrix to a simple\n2 ×2 matrix, based on using OpenAI’s latest reasoning model o3-mini-high to exactly solve the q = 3\ncase. It is found that the model can be mapped to the 1D q-state Potts model with J2 acting as the nearest-\nneighbor interaction and J1 as an effective magnetic field, extending the previous proof for q= 2, i.e., the Ising\nmodel. The exact results provide insights to outstanding physical problems such as the stacking of atomic or\nelectronic orders in layered materials and the formation of a Tc-dome-shaped phase often seen in unconventional\nsuperconductors. This work is anticipated to fuel both the research in one-dimensional frustrated magnets for\nrecently discovered finite-temperature application potentials and the fast moving topic area of AI for sciences.\n\nOpenAI staffer claims to have had GPT5-Pro prove/improve on a math paper on Twitter, it was later superseded by another human paper, but the solution it provided was novel and better than the v1 https://x.com/SebastienBubeck/status/1958198661139009862\n\nProof: I took a convex optimization paper with a clean open problem in it and asked gpt-5-pro to work on it. It proved a better bound than what is in the paper, and I checked the proof it's correct.\n\nAs you can see in the top post, gpt-5-pro was able to improve the bound from this paper and showed that in fact eta can be taken to be as large as 1.5/L, so not quite fully closing the gap but making good progress. Def. a novel contribution that'd be worthy of a nice arxiv note.\n\nProfessor of Mathematics at UCLA Ernest Ryu’s analysis: https://nitter.net/ErnestRyu/status/1958408925864403068\n\n>This is really exciting and impressive, and this stuff is in my area of mathematics research (convex optimization). I have a nuanced take.\nThere are 3 proofs in discussion: v1. ( η ≤ 1/L, discovered by human ) v2. ( η ≤ 1.75/L, discovered by human ) v.GTP5 ( η ≤ 1.5/L, discovered by AI ) Sebastien argues that the v.GPT5 proof is impressive, even though it is weaker than the v2 proof.\nThe proof itself is arguably not very difficult for an expert in convex optimization, if the problem is given. Knowing that the key inequality to use is [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5], I could prove v2 in a few hours by searching through the set of relevant combinations.\n(And for reasons that I won’t elaborate here, the search for the proof is precisely a 6-dimensional search problem. The author of the v2 proof, Moslem Zamani, also knows this. I know Zamani’s work enough to know that he knows.)   (In research, the key challenge is often in finding problems that are both interesting and solvable. This paper is an example of an interesting problem definition that admits a simple solution.)\nWhen proving bounds (inequalities) in math, there are 2 challenges: (i) Curating the correct set of base/ingredient inequalities. (This is the part that often requires more creativity.) (ii) Combining the set of base inequalities. (Calculations can be quite arduous.)\nIn this problem, that [Nesterov Theorem 2.1.5] should be the key inequality to be used for (i) is known to those working in this subfield.\nSo, the choice of base inequalities (i) is clear/known to me, ChatGPT, and Zamani. Having (i) figured out significantly simplifies this problem. The remaining step (ii) becomes mostly calculations.\nThe proof is something an experienced PhD student could work out in a few hours. That GPT-5 can do it with just ~30 sec of human input is impressive and potentially very useful to the right user. However, GPT5 is by no means exceeding the capabilities of human experts.\"\n\nNote the last sentence shows hes not just trying to hype it up.\n\nGPT-5 outlining proofs and suggesting related extensions, from a recent hep-th paper on quantum field theory\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/pvNDTvH.jpeg\n\nSource: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21276v1\n\nAugust 2025:  Oxford and Cambridge mathematicians publish a paper entitled \"No LLM Solved Yu Tsumura's 554th problem\".  https://x.com/deredleritt3r/status/1974862963442868228\n\nThey gave this problem to o3 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, Claude Opus 4 (Extended Thinking) and other models, with instructions to \"not perform a web search to solve theproblem.  No LLM could solve it.\n\nThe paper smugly claims: \"We show, contrary to the optimism about LLM's problem-solving abilities, fueled by the recent gold medals that were attained, that aproblemexists—Yu Tsumura’s 554th problem—that a) is within the scope of an IMO problem in terms of proof sophistication, b) is not a combinatorics problem which has caused issues for LLMs, c) requires fewer proof techniques than typical hard IMO problems, d) has a publicly available solution (likely in the training data of LLMs), and e) that cannot be readily solved by any existing off-the-shelf LLM (commercial or open-source).\"\n\n(Apparently, these mathematicians didn't get the memo that the unreleased OpenAI and Google models that won gold on the IMO are significantly more powerful than the publicly available models they tested.  But no matter.)\n\nOctober 2025:  GPT-5 Pro solves Yu Tsumura's 554th problem in 15 minutes\n\nBut somehow none of the other models made it. Also the solution of GPT Pro is slightly different. I position it as: here was a problem, I had no clue how to search for it on the web but the model got enough tricks in its training that now it can finally \"reason\" about such simple problems and reconstruct or extrapolate solutions. \n\nAnother user independently reproduced this proof; prompt included express instructions to not use search. https://x.com/deredleritt3r/status/1974870140861960470\n\nProfessor of Mathematics @ UCI: GPT-5 Pro found a counterexample to the NICD-with-erasures majority optimality (Simons list, p.25).

      "text": "In my previous job I spent most of it burnt out, for a couple of reasons: frustration about our shitty tech stack, WFH (the isolation is killing me tbh), and lack of direction from my boss’s boss (we were building a product but they keep asking us to add this and that feature when we weren’t even in production yet, and there was never a concrete plan on what to do in order to get it to production and start attracting customers). \n\nNow I have had a bit of a break and am starting my next job soon. We’ll also be building a product from scratch like at my previous job. My upcoming team lead seems excited about it, based on the interview we had. He is the kind of boss that doesn’t want us to work overtime. And it’s hybrid, which is a breath of fresh air, both metaphorically and literally. \n\nAnd yet I’m still concerned about burning out. Our tech stack might still end up becoming a mess. I want to be able to speak up and say “let’s refactor this and that” or “let’s not add yet another microservice please” or “I’d like to add these tests here” but I fear about becoming the ‘maintenance guy’ who does things no ones else likes to do themselves and yet is appreciated by nobody. Or becoming known as the guy who always questions the SME and yet isn’t that experienced himself. But I also want to follow my previous boss's advice to \"stop being so passive, speak up your mind\". Seems like I'm stuck between a rock and hard place, no?\n\nI’ve been watching career advice on YouTube and the advice that I want to follow the most is to “be reliable & consistent and stop caring about your job so much”. I’m definitely the type of worker who gets excited about the job, goes above and beyond for the first few months then slowly loses motivation until even doing the bare minimum takes effort. In order to avoid that, do I literally just do the bare minimum from day 1? Not sure what else to do. Probably a good idea to allocate a certain amount of energy to doing my job, then spend my extra energy on networking and learning how the company works (not that I have any idea how to do these things, my previous job was in a small startup), with the goal of advancing my career by eventually getting promoted and/or job hopping.\n\nTo any devs who haven't burned out in a long time, what is your secret to not burning out? Any advice for me in particular?\n\nThanks in advance.",

I’ve generally managed to keep a high pace without falling off using a couple tactics:\n\n- Find a job where you actually enjoy the product. It’s so much easier to stay motivated when you see and directly benefit from the result, even if you are just a small cog in the big picture\n- Always be self aware and monitoring your state, and take long weekends / decompression time when you are starting to slow down\n- Always be laser focused on the most impactful and important efforts and basically deprioritize everything else. Don’t peanut butter spread yourself over a million concerns you don’t control, just focus on the opportunities you have in front of you \n- Use your leadership 1:1s to get a solid understanding of their goals and priorities. These are the impactful areas to focus on, and good areas to speak up if you can advance the mission somehow, because everyone will be interested in those ideas\n\nLastly, it does help to be smart and talented. When you can accomplish things faster than most people, it gives you room to push on those other ideas. If you are just consistent but barely finishing your sprint tasks, it’s gonna be hard to spend an afternoon POCing some new solution to a new problem.",

You have to attract the best talent, make sure incentives are properly put in place, implement the right processes to efficiently work togrther, make sure people stay engaged over time... an organization can go wrong for so many reasons.\n\nI've simultaneously been the dumbest and the smartest person on a project. Even when I knew my team members were more competent than me, I was surprised how much I could contribute by doing simple things like keeping conversations on track and taking up important tasks that wasn't on my coworkers' radars. On the other hand when I was the most senior, it baffled me how little impact I was able to have on others' behavior despite trying to be a good role model and trying my best to transfer knowledge.\n\nMy conclusion from all this is that, at the end of the day unless you are in management it's just not your job to try and change other people's behaviors, and if those behaviors cause issues for the product then it is not your fault. Outside of that, there's nothing stopping you from doing your best within the purview of your own job. Ask all the questions you want and take up the maintenance work you think is important. As long as you maintain collegiality in the workplace and you personally feel like you are learning important skills in the process, it's a win-win. At the end of the day no job lasts forever and the only thing you are carrying forward to your next role is your knowledge, experience, and connections. Don't sweat the other stuff.",

At one of my projects before my previous job (college years so the entire team was all students, the clients were also students), we were tasked with maintaining an old WordPress website, It was so hard to work with I suggested recreating the website using a CMS hosted on GitHub Pages, since they would save money by paying $0 in web hosting fees, also there was no WordPress-exclusive feature anyways (it was a website with little more than a homepage, a few blog posts, an about us page, and a contact us page). I tried my best to assert myself and present my case, and my suggestion was approved, but I was the one tasked with setting up the CMS while the other teammates will populate the data once I finished the setup. Months later, I wasn't close to done with the setup, and my motivation was at an all time low. A common case of underestimating the task. I ended up ghosting my teammates, mostly due to an overwhelming feeling of shame about barely having done anything. Looking back I definitely should have stuck with the WordPress site, but I was too inexperienced with real-world software engineering to realize that, only having coded toy projects myself.\n\nThen a few years later at my previous job I was pretty much a code monkey, doing what my boss tells me to do, only confronting him when it makes sense to do so (unreasonable deadlines, unnecessary microservices, etc). And I found that much simpler and more stress-free. I try not to refactor if I can help it. Yes I was frustrated with the tech stack (microservices hell) but at the very least I wasn't the one responsible for it, my boss was. All I was responsible for was the work I did. The architecture decisions were ultimately made by my boss (with feedback from the team), so the architecture was my boss's problem.\n\n\\> If we only had perfect architectures and no crappy code it'd mean we probably were gold plating or in a constant state of re-write.\n\nI don't understand this sentence, what do you mean by it?",

Caring deeply about outcomes and tech is how I've gotten this far. You have to have the sense to only apply that care to what you control, and what you influence. Anything else, is worry without benefit.\n2. I've definitely burned out before, mostly early in my career. It happens when you put in a lot of work, don't get the reward for it, but are asked to keep going. When that happens, the reinforcement learning in our brain re-calculates the prospect of doing work as no longer worth it. Therefore, you need spend time appreciating your own work, and celebrating it's success.\n3. It's really helped me to take a step back, and really think about what \"good work\" entails. For me, it's taking ownership, being helpful, and leading by example in my technical work and interactions. I try to focus on those \"wins\", which are pretty obtainable with by showing up everyday and paying attention.\n4. Align yourself with the broader company and management goals. So much strife happens from engineers choosing craft over business relevance. You need to know what makes great code, and be prepared to trade that off for velocity.",

You need a good enough working relationship with your manager that you can tell them no, and decide how much responsibility you can take on. You need to understand enough about your team’s structure to figure out who should be working on any random issue you notice.

          "text": "I've never burned out and I've been doing this for almost 20 years. I can credit this on two things. First, the labour laws here in Finland are strict to protect the employee. We can only work on average 37.5h a week and overtime has to be agreed on by both parties. You can't spend more time on the job, even though you can take the job at home with you and mull over it, but I never did that too much.\n\nSecondly, I consider myself rather good at detecting when I'm getting too exhausted. I've had this happen a few times in my life where I just realized I didn't have time for everything and it started to become too much. This also happened recently, when I had to start looking for a new job, change tech stacks, get onto a new project where the customer somehow expected me to immediately know everything, kids at home were tiring me out and required so much focus and time from me. So many things at once. Everything was stressful.\n\nFirst thing I did was make the decision to quit my freelancer business. No more projects. They had began to consume too much time. Apps became too complex and required too much maintenance.\n\nI also stopped educating myself for a while. Didn't read any work related articles, watch videos, listen to audio books, nothing. Picked up a few fantasy books instead. Every day when I reached 7.5h of work, I just tuned out. Started meditating to quiet out the buzzing in my head and shift back to family mode. I stopped caring about it as it was just a job. This particular project was good for it. Even though there were tasks we had to get done before a deadline and those became really tight, I just didn't care. I had only been on the project for a few months, these promises were done before I joined on.\n\nIt's just about realizing you're doing too much, you're getting tired, time to slow down. Prioritize.

Definitely some weeks here and there where I felt burnt out, but never something taking a day off here or there wasn't enough to cure.\n\nMy advice is find a team (and a manager) you like working with. I don't understand the posts from the \"every man for himself, it's just a job\" people, that absolutely seems a recipe to burn out for me. The only job I felt like that was straight out of college, and I left it as soon as I could.\n\n>And yet I’m still concerned about burning out. Our tech stack might still end up becoming a mess. I want to be able to speak up and say “let’s refactor this and that” or “let’s not add yet another microservice please” or “I’d like to add these tests here” but I fear about becoming the ‘maintenance guy’ who does things no ones else likes to do themselves and yet is appreciated by nobody. Or becoming known as the guy who always questions the SME and yet isn’t that experienced himself. But I also want to follow my previous boss's advice to \"stop being so passive, speak up your mind\". Seems like I'm stuck between a rock and hard place, no?\n\nAll of this is reasonable, but they're mostly not things you can drive yourself if the environment you're entering is very far away from it. Your new company sounds promising, so keep your fingers crossed, but feel out how it is after the first six to twelve months. If your manager and team mates still feel like allies in making it a good culture keep pushing in the directions you want, but if feels like everything is an uphill fight start looking elsewhere.\n\n>  and there was never a concrete plan on what to do in order to get it to production and start attracting customers)\n\nThis one very much is something you specifically can drive, but you need some experience with the product or the space first. I've seen a lot of experienced engineers and experienced managers who do have the context they'd need to sit the team down and identify what they should build towards and what they need to build away from, but who instead just complained about the team's tech debt while taking the easiest most short-sighted path to every feature request ever. If senior engineers on the team aren't willing to come up with overall plans for the team or product and then sell other people at the company on it, then you're at the mercy of whoever walks up to your bosses' boss with a shiny idea.\n\nNot giving a fuck isn't a way to avoid burn-out, IMO that means you're already burnt out, but need to keep getting a paycheck so endure whatever shit gets thrown at you.",

I also think that allowing yourself to do small experiments in your work and detaching from the outcome and iteration of that is good. Not feeling every single problem or difficulty as a personal fault (i.e why am I so bad at this? Or why does this keep happening? ) and instead as helpful data is a good change of mindset",

But  being HP is not the same as being able to be a high performer for a limited time. Especially when there's challenges outside of work that also requires constant attention.\n\nIt is a matter of priorities.\n\nYes, sometimes one is on the critical chain at work. Sometimes a lot of people aren't able to do anything useful at all while waiting for ones delivery. But, that is usually not the case, if proper planning is done.\n\nThese are the key steps that works (but I, too, fail to follow):\n\nDont try to make up for previous people's delays in order to meet your own deadline. Don't fix other people's problems when they aren't taking responsibility for their work - not even if it takes you 1/10th of the time compared to if they would do it. You don't need to be their rock star developer.\n\nEven if being away from work for a week or two, doesn't ruin the project; \"fires\" occurring when being away tend to having been delt with, or they turned out to not be that critical. If the fire could wait for your return, they can wait another week or so, to be properly planned and delt with just like any other task.\n\nThere's an old saying;\n\nAccept what you can't change. \nChange what YOU can do.\nAnd recognize the difference.\n\nEnsuring longevity of the code base is a line job of a senior (not just in title) or principal engineer, with the manager ensuring non-project specific time is allocated. As an engineer with a couple of years of experience, you are able and responsible to make your new code maintainable as you write it. Reactor a little as you go, but don't rewrite - the latter takes just as long time as it did writing it in the beginning.\n\nWhen stakeholders adds features to the project, it is the project manager's and the product owner's job to scope out other features or agree on a delay in shipment. There WILL be opportunities later in the project - or in the next project - to say \"oh, you want that new feature, too? We didn't anticipate such a change in requirement, so we will have to accommodate the code for it. Your unexpected feature will take X time to implement\". They won't like it, but they do understand it's going to be needed (but they will pretend they don't) . Save your objections to those occasions.\n\nYou can always raise your concern to your team - but only do it once per concern. You say you might want to network to enable a future promotion. Remember, your promotion must be in line with what you WANT to do, not just what the company want to PAY you to do. Your responsibility in this, is getting GOOD at what YOU want to do. Nowadays, companies offer promotion paths that's either managerial, customer or technically oriented. \n\nYou also mention the previous bosses not having a good launch-plan. Going from vision to getting happy customers are hard. Much harder than many visionaries know. They were likely finding out as they talked to potential customers what would be needed, and learning from their employed engineers and PMs what they didn't know was going to be needed as well.",

It's a group effort!\"\n\nAlso, try to not seek the approval of others. It's nice, but if you can just appreciate yourself for doing these things then you never have to worry about getting appreciation from others. \n\n> Or becoming known as the guy who always questions the SME and yet isn’t that experienced himself.\n\nWhat is your concern here?",

          "text": "Almost 20 years, not burned out. \n\nThe advice I see in a lot of the comments here is to not care, or not get emotionally invested. I don't think that would work for me. \n\nWhat works for me is to be a smooth cog in the system, work within the process, ask questions for clarity, and know who is responsible for what. \n\nWorking within the process: \n- notice a bug, create a ticket, notify if needed, move on.  Don't try to fix it myself right away. \n- find out the milestones, plan tasks that are doable within those timeframes *with buffer* for refactors and bugs and overhead. Don't try to squeeze in extra features. \n- participate in lessons learned or retro sessions. When they want feedback on process, pick your top two suggestions and phrase them politely. Don't keep it to yourself and also don't dwell on it continually. \n-  Use the review infrastructure set up for feedback....for feedback. Don't pepper people with unsolicited feedback at weird times. It can come up organically but there's a limit. On the flip side, for every code review, have something constructive to offer or have a question in the back of your mind to ask if they don't answer it in a comment or otherwise. Don't just not give feedback. \n- be about as responsive as average on the standard comms channels. Reply to emails within a day unless they're urgent. Reply to chat within an hour. Your team may vary. But it's okay to close outlook or mute notifications for a short focused work block.\n\n\nAsking questions, especially as you acclimate to a new team. \n- which is higher priority, x or y? \n- what's the guidance on unit test coverage for this team? \n- I noticed a bit of code that is going to become problematic under higher data load. How/where would you like me to document it? \n- do we have any approved tools for abc?\n- who should I talk to about getting XYZ?\n\n\nKnow who is responsible for what...\n- is there an admin assigned to make travel arrangements and do expense reports for your team? If so, let them do their job, don't spend your time on it. \n- is there a test lead who sets test & eval targets? If you have feedback it goes to them, then leave it alone and let them do their job. \n- who is responsible for monitoring risks and mitigations? Make sure they have any critical information, and then let them make the tough calls. \n- if it's not you job to make the decision, then it's your job to share pertinent information and not worry about making the decision. There will be plenty of times when it is your job to worry about making the decision--dont take more of those than you need to.\n\nWhen you're not at work, you're no longer a cog in the system. If it's hybrid work then especially be careful at home that you have a hard cutoff where you are done with work and fully disconnect from it. Pace yourself, especially in the beginning.\n\nFocus on hobbies. Have something exciting or fun in your life that's not related to work or work colleagues. If all you do is work and sustain yourself to be able to work, you'll have a harder time. Take up rock climbing or join a weekly bar trivia team or volunteer at your animal shelter or....whatever sounds good to you.",

          "text": "I guess I see red flags already. If you want to not burn out you have to stop taking other lack of excitement or interest in code quality or refactors personally. Either do that stuff and accept that nobody will appreciate it (obviously as long as the employer allows it). Or work on things that will be appreciated. It sounds like you want to be appreciated. So maybe explore what other people want vs. pursuing your own personal interests on the job. When you show up to work you are working for a company and on a team. But if you are always mentally at odds with what that company or team is doing you will grow bitter and burn out. Not giving a shit could work. Or you could try to give a shit about some realistic subset of things that are interesting to you AND what the company wants and see where that gets you (this will require lowering expectations). I think most people go wrong because they have shitty WLB, go way too hard early on, simply get bored, end up in situations without any upward mobility, or harbor significant resentments about what’s being done and how it’s being done. I’m working through that last one these days. My only advice is to stay flexible and to not be so rigid or uncompromising with what you think the job should be or would like it to be. Just show up. Identify what the company needs. Talk to people if you aren’t sure. Do quality work. Detach your identity from the work i.e. stop caring about what others think outside of specific measurable personal goals (i.e. do not get fired, get promoted). Leave it all behind at 5 pm.",

This links to the topic of civilization collapse or decline due to overcomplexity. \n\nOther overcomplexities include ever-expanding costs and size of HR departments… entire squads of people just focused on hiring, firing and making sure the company doesn’t get sued.\n\nAnother overcomplexity is the multi billion dollar HIPPA industry. Massive conglomerates built just for the concept of not being a busy body by gossiping or sharing info on someone’s disease. \n\nThese overcomplexities gradually suck wealth out of the economy just to operate.

      "text": "DeepSeek just released a pretty shocking new paper. They really buried the lede here by referring to it simply as DeepSeek OCR. \n\nWhile it’s a very strong OCR model, the purpose of it and the implications of their approach go far beyond what you’d expect of “yet another OCR model.”\n\nTraditionally, vision LLM tokens almost seemed like an afterthought or “bolt on” to the LLM paradigm. And 10k words of English would take up far more space in a multimodal LLM when expressed as intelligible pixels than when expressed as tokens.\n\nSo those 10k words may have turned into 15k tokens, or 30k to 60k “visual tokens.” So vision tokens were way less efficient and really only made sense to use for data that couldn’t be effectively conveyed with words. \n\nBut that gets inverted now from the ideas in this paper. DeepSeek figured out how to get 10x better compression using vision tokens than with text tokens! So you could theoretically store those 10k words in just 1,500 of their special compressed visual tokens.\n\nThis might not be as unexpected as it sounds if you think of how your own mind works. After all, I know that when I’m looking for a part of a book that I’ve already read, I imagine it visually and always remember which side of the book it was on and approximately where on the page it was, which suggests some kind of visual memory representation at work.\n\nNow, it’s not clear how exactly this interacts with the other downstream cognitive functioning of an LLM; can the model reason as intelligently over those compressed visual tokens as it can using regular text tokens? Does it make the model less articulate by forcing it into a more vision-oriented modality? \n\nBut you can imagine that, depending on the exact tradeoffs, it could be a very exciting new axis to greatly expand effective context sizes. Especially when combined with DeepSeek’s other recent paper from a couple weeks ago about sparse attention.\n\nFor all we know, Google could have already figured out something like this, which could explain why Gemini has such a huge context size and is so good and fast at OCR tasks. If they did, they probably wouldn’t say because it would be viewed as an important trade secret.\n\nBut the nice thing about DeepSeek is that they’ve made the entire thing open source and open weights and explained how they did it, so now everyone can try it out and explore.\n\nEven if these tricks make attention more lossy, the potential of getting a frontier LLM with a 10 or 20 million token context window is pretty exciting. \n\nYou could basically cram all of a company’s key internal documents into a prompt preamble and cache this with OpenAI and then just add your specific query or prompt on top of that and not have to deal with search tools and still have it be fast and cost-effective. \n\nOr put an entire code base into the context and cache it, and then just keep appending the equivalent of the git diffs as you make changes to the code. \n\nIf you’ve ever read stories about the great physicist Hans Bethe, he was known for having vast amounts of random physical facts memorized (like the entire periodic table; boiling points of various substances, etc.) so that he could seamlessly think and compute without ever having to interrupt his flow to look something up in a reference table. \n\nHaving vast amounts of task-specific knowledge in your working memory is extremely useful. This seems like a very clever and additive approach to potentially expanding that memory bank by 10x or more.\n\nsource: https://x.com/doodlestein/status/1980282222893535376",

          "text": "This is pretty cool. What strikes me as unique is their framing of the vision token bottleneck as a feature rather than a flaw.\n\nI studied Gemma 3 to learn about how modern vision language models work. Here's a diagram I created for a video I think is helpful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d32as17gicwf1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=d50849d1536d2c8232ad9bedd4002ada1d252739\n\nAs you can see, there are 2 pieces, the vision tower + a standard language model. The vision tower is quite literally bolted on to a normal language model. For Gemma 3 specifically, the data flow is:\n\n1. A preprocessing step to convert an image into 3 x 896 x 896 pixels\n\n2. A vision transformer to process the pixels into 4096 image tokens\n\n3. A multimodal projector to compress the 4096 image tokens into 256 tokens, which importantly are semantically meaningful in the language model's latent space\n\n4. The image tokens and text tokens are processed identically by the language model\n\nI assumed that the high degree of compression involved in going from an image into those 256 image tokens was a limitation; there is only so much that can be encoded in 256 tokens. This paper frames that compression as a positive.\n\nSomething I find interesting is that text tokens map 1:1 to a place in embedding space: each token in the vocabulary has exactly 1 vector representation. The image tokens are different. From my studies, it looks like image tokens have vector representations that seem to exist between text tokens.\n\nMy point there is that image tokens are more expressive than text tokens. I think that this aligns with their framing of vision tokens providing compression.\n\nIf you're interested, I created a video \"[Dissecting Vision Language Models: How AI Sees](https://youtu.be/NpWP-hOq6II?si=Qun_EsWq7LLQ4ugw)\" that goes deeper into the standard architecture of VLMs as well as investigating the semantic interpretability of vision tokens by doing unembedding analysis.",

I know I could get away with simply sequencing LLM calls and strictly control the control flow, but I want to be fancy and see how much I can do the agentic thing. So I ended up building a system where agents can plan, write down to do list, use tool to spawn other agents to carry tasks on the list, and each agents have access to the file tools.\n\nThe OSS-20B was the favourite candidate because it's very fast. Until I realise it keeps looping when it tries to edit file.  Constantly listing files and reading files without editing, until running out of context length. It does converge, but not consistently, which is not good for automated agent flows. No matter how I prompt, this behaviour does not improve.\n\nSo I drop the 30B-A3B in instead. Yes, the speed drops from 70t/s to 40t/s on my setup, but the agent flow converges consistently. \n\nI also use this model to chat, brainstorm coding issues, and power my code autocomplete. Very happy with what it can do. I'll buy more ram to wait for the 80B version.",

I think this is what “fake productivity” feels like. You look busy, your calendar’s full, you’re in constant motion but nothing meaningful gets done. It’s like your brain’s buffering all day.  \nOut of frustration I wrote “DO ONE REAL THING” on a sticky note and forced myself to focus on a single task. Ended up finishing a small landing page redesign I’d been putting off for weeks.  \nThat tiny win hit like dopamine crack. That little change worked way better than any productivity app. I think I’ve been chasing “organized chaos” when all I really needed was to simplify.

          "text": "Yeah I think most people experience this from time to time. The trouble is \"task switching cost\" - jumping between Slack, Notion, email, work, etc, your prefrontal cortex had to completely reload context each time which just burns through your mental bandwidth and makes you \"feel busy\".\n\nWhen you shift tasks, part of your brain is still thinking about the previous task (appropriately called \"attention residue\") so you're never actually giving full resources to anything. It feels like productivity because you're moving constantly, but you're running at reduced capacity all day. It's sort of like having a bunch of tabs open in your browser.\n\nThe funny thing is that the fix for this is something called \"singular focus protocol\", basically your \"DO ONE REAL THING\" sticky note so you kind of did solve the problem already.\n\nBy forcing your brain to commit to ONE task, you eliminated the switching cost. Your prefrontal cortex could actually finish building the mental model it needed to solve the problem.\n\nAs a fun aside (because I love stuff like this), it takes like 23 minutes to reach full cognitive engagement on a complex task but most people never get there because they break focus every 11 minutes for things like Slack, email, or \"just checking\" something.\n\nAlso, just for the sake of completeness, you're right that our brain releases dopamine when it perceives progress toward a goal. Slack replies don't usually trigger it because they're reactive, not goal-directed. But shipping that landing page is measurable forward movement so your reward circuitry lit up.\n\nI don't think the answer is \"less structure works better\" because it's not actually less structure. It's SIMPLER structure, which I think is an important point to make. One clear target beats ten organized tasks every time.\n\nRemember, your brain can't optimize for ten things simultaneously but it's incredibly good at optimizing for one.\n\nJust as a shameless plug, if you dig stuff like this (identifying and leveraging psychological concepts to improve your life) I publish a 3 minute newsletter 3x per week called the Daily Mindset Flip (link is in my bio under my social links), I love talking about stuff like this.\n\nEdit: Reddit had some weird content duplication things happening when the comment posted so I cleaned it up.",

It's not impractical to detect if someone breaks the treaty: current models at least require massive regional power stations.

And we limit risk by ensuring that they have limited autonomy. But we don’t really know what their “goals” are in any useful sense. \n\nApproaching AGI/ASI presents all sorts of issues. Any model that can learn on the go or operate agnatically over longer time horizons is not testable in the same brute force way. We already know that models can assess when they’re being tested and modify output accordingly. We already know they do not give truthful explanations of their internal state.\n\nAnd against that backdrop, we have economic incentives which are causing risk maximisation. Competition between AI labs but also corporate customers who want to minimise their employment costs. At the moment, there is still generally a human in the loop. If systems become much more competent, there will not be sufficient humans in the loop - at best, it will be viewed as a compliance style cost center and history is full of examples of that sort of second line supervision being defeated. \n\nI agree that none of this is obviously imminent, but the economy is increasingly structured around good chunks of the puzzle falling into place pretty soon.",

One solution that comes to my mind is that the computing power was actually freed but it was immediatelly consumed by making models bigger or as you mentioned that the deepseek team ommited some costs of the training and the presented figures are simply fake.",

They used  MoE to activate only a subset of parameters per token, which  reduced inference cost and made the model far more efficient. They also leveraged distillation from frontier models to be competitive in performance relative to training cost.\n\nThe key insight was that you didn't need to follow the same scaling-law trajectory as AI juggernauts like OpenAI to reach competitive performance—smarter architecture and training recipes could get you much of the way there for a fraction of the cost. Given the lightning speed pace of AI advancements, DeepSeek was quickly leapfrogged by newer models, and the initial cost advantage narrowed as competitors adopted similar techniques.\n\nIt was relevant because it spooked stock market investors that China can develop models cheaper and relatively quickly, without relying on billion dollar contracts with Nvidia. So geopolitcally it started a conversation if US is really miles ahead of China in the AI race.",

But if China could keep up with pace of open source releases with comparable or slightly worse models thatn those from openai/anthropic, even though they don't have direct access to the top of line GPUs (and Chinese companies didn't do the type of capex US companies do), then the game would be very interesting and I'd even call it for the Chinese: there is no way to justify the type of capex investment we've seen last few weeks with the sort of incremental improvement if they couldn't dramatically increase the gap between chatgpt/claude and qwen/deepseek than where the gap is now, openai would bleed itself dry/take down the entire AI industry in the US with them if they couldn't match performance with size of stuff announced last few weeks\n\nprior to the trillion level investment, AI was expensive but I can still see it pays for itself, now it's just hard to see how it could possibly pay for the capex",

It felt like a loss at the time but that imbalance of power never leads to good business. With hindsight, I'd probably try to introduce premiums for specific bad behaviour (e.g. last minute request fee) and stick to them religiously. Then if the customer leaves, they leave. If they stay they'll be incentivised to behave better, and who knows, maybe they will (if not you can keep increasing those premiums). I think the scenario where they accept the blanket price increase but continue behaving badly doesn't do enough to fix the issue - they'll still make your life hell.",

EG: standing conversation at X time for 1hour, when support is expected, how it is to be delivered etc. You should lay everything out so that when they go outside the scope it is clear and you can then address the scope issue. It has been very rare that we have come across a client that finds this unreasonable. No one gives full access. It is not wise to make emotional decisions or to go at a client with blame.

I end up underselling myself completely. It’s like being fluent in a language but forgetting every word the moment someone asks you to speak. Has anyone else dealt with this?

It helps to practice by explaining things you might describe in an interview to someone who doesn't know anything about what you do. It could be a partner, a friend or family member.

This will undo all the rotation.\n\nSo theres exist a constant c, for a given sequence of rotations that will undo all the rotation, if the original sequence is twice applied but, with each angle scaled by c.\n\nThis is important because is not intuitive.

Invoke is an Apache 2.0 project - It will continue to be available as an open-source installation that you can self-host and run. We've updated the repository to position it as best as possible for continued expansion and maintenance. lstein and blessedcoolant are taking over stewardship of the project. They have been active community members since the inception of this project and will be good stewards going forward. We've recently updated the Model Management interface to help put the application and community in a good position for long-term support and extensibility. This community has been at the heart of everything we've built, and from day one, you've pushed us to build better. We're excited to see you all continue to build on the foundation we've laid for Invoke. As for me - I’ll still be sharing my experiments and learnings in using new technologies, so stay tuned. When it comes to this craft, we’re just beginning. – Kent",

Adobe is huge and with its continuous effort, sooner or later Photoshop will have everything that Invoke offers.\n\nIt is a simple strategy. Big company offers a deal. If you agree. Deal. If you don't. Well, they keep developing similar product and take over your market share anyway.\n\nSamsung did this, Apple did this, Google, Facebook, etc all did this.\n\nI can extend the idea to other things like how Nestle controls more than 100 different brands. In Vietnam, at least 3 bottle water brands are owned by Nestle. That shows how far their reach can be. Similar to how Tencent grabs the technology industry or recently the Arab investment took over EA.\n\nEssentially, if I call this tactic \"statcheck\".

Might as well take the VC subsidy while you wait for them to go bust and liquidate the hardware into the secondary market.",

Yeah, a 20B dense model will probably beat a 20B A5B MOE.  If you're processing a shit load of data through smaller specialized models, maybe a single fast GPU makes sense and you can get away with a particular selection of small models that fit into limited VRAM.\n\nBudget constraint?  You're probably better off looking at products like the Ryzen 395, old ass TR/Epyc + 16gb GPU, etc. or a bunch of 3090s purely to get more total memory, or upgrading to 128GB sys memory.  GPU+128GB sys memory seems to run models like gpt-oss 120b fairly well even with just a run of the mill desktop with 2 channel DDR5 memory as a lower budget option.\n\nSpeed constraint?  Usefulness/quality constraint?  MOEs smoke dense models for a given t/s on quality, or a given quality on t/s. \n\nAnother thing that is clear is that we're going to see MOE take over.

Comparing Qwen3-235B-A22B to Qwen3-32B is illuminating.  For tasks which depend more on memorized knowledge, the MoE is clearly better, but for tasks which depend more on generalized knowledge (\"smarts\"), the dense is clearly better.\n\nNow, that's just one data point, and I don't know that it can be extended to cover the general case, but it seems about right for other MoE vs dense comparisons which are less oranges-to-oranges, too.\n\nIt would be nicely congruent with the findings of this study, though -- https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24832v1",

GPT-OSS(21B-A4B or 117B-A5B) is more similar to Phi; its performance on STEM benchmarks and in specific domains can sometimes be excellent among similar sized open weight models. However, its general conversational performance is mediocre (or in other words, with a similar parameter count, there are two more versatile competitors: Qwen3-30B-A3B and GLM-4.5-Air). Overall, the GPT-OSS-120B is more useful than the GPT-OSS-20B, as you can achieve barely usable performance on a PC with 64GB of DDR5.\n3. Qwen3-235B-A22B-2507 is arguably the \"gatekeeper\" for high-performance LLMs. While models like Deepseek-V3.1, GLM-4.6, Kimi K2, and the closed-source gpt5-chat might perform better on certain tasks, the performance gap is often not significant. I'm inclined to consider GLM-4.6 as the best open weight model overall, though the margin between it and the others might not be substantial.\n\nSpecific to model deployment:\n\n1. The deployment of MoE models is moving towards two extremes: local deployment with bs=1 or very small, and cloud deployment with very large batch sizes utilizing Prefill-Decode disaggregation and cross-node expert parallelism. The latter is largely irrelevant to the r/LocalLLaMA community, while the former offers no significant cost advantage over cloud solutions. The days of running Qwen-72B or Llama-70B with TP4 on four 3090s using vLLM are over.\n2. Currently, no so-called AI PC or unified memory device can match the performance of a similarly priced combination of GPUs and server CPUs.\n3. Ollama is actually good as a starting point, as it saves users without a technical background the trouble of installing the CUDA Toolkit and compiling code. However, it introduces extraneous \"cloud\"-related features that are irrelevant to local LLM operation, along with an unnecessary Ollama-specific API.\n4. vLLM and CUDA 13 are dropping support for GPUs with SM7.5 and below, so buying any pre-Ampere GPU (e.g., 2080 Ti, V100) is not a sustainable long-term choice. In my opinion, only NVIDIA's Ampere (and newer) architectures and AMD's RDNA 4 are truly viable for AI workloads.",

Enthusiasts will continue playing with old models, fine-tuning, RAG, LoRA, whatever, but performance and knowledge-wise, it will be far behind the cutting-edge SOTA AI.\n\nWhy is this a 'hot-take'? Because I feel like so many LocalLLaMa fellows here are taking open-source/weight AI models for granted. AI is expensive as fuck, to train and run, it's just that global VC money is suppressing such price for now. Personally I even think it's a miracle that we happen to have a full public access to the SOTA-grade free and open AI models currently, such as DeepSeek, Kimi, and GLM. \n\nRemember, this is not \"free\".",

Most people who try to defend my point end up going the \"increase/introduce new penalties\" route, i.e. if caught, having to serve greater time imprisoned or something, since it's the method we've used for deterring so many other unwanted acts. Not a fan of this method, so see below. For the question about AI models themselves detecting it, we could simply have a hidden prompt in AI systems saying e.g. \"Assess whether the request from the user sounds like they want to create non-consensual media\" (for those who don't even try to hide their intent from AI). Likely false positive inducing I know, yet maybe still useful.\n\nSince we're in this sub, we're more aware of tech development and how fast it's coming than other people. Therefore, we can peer a bit into the future: akin to Altman's hated/controversial [WorldCoin ID system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_(blockchain\\)), despite the fact that these initial attempts have problems I foresee a near future where we have something like this. Physical likeness database tied to digital IDs, major sites will require approval from ID owner to use their likeness. Would prefer this method. Prevent crime rather than punish it.\n\nGoing to end off with something likely very controversial here, regarding your point about needing sufficient accuracy: even if accuracy is not 100%, causing harm through false positives and such, as long as it's not too low it may be good enough to implement anyway.

This worked great, except a small % of iOS devices with Safari, which lacked local storage permissions to hold the token, and all tripped as having the same fingerprint. \n\nUntil that thing was deployed live, it would never be devised such a test case. The repository was rock solid, outside of this logical flaw in the design that wasn't revealed until truly real world data was run through.\n\nThis is one example of many in my life, just the most recent but - hey, now I know. Next time, I can deal with a different problem. The reason I didn't have problems scaling it or building it in the first place were thanks to the twenty years of successive failures prior that taught me enough to get this far.\n\nSomebody said \"I stand on the shoulders of giants\",  but I often crawl around on my mountain of failures.",

      "text": "I've spent the past 8 months the trenches, I want to share what actually worked vs. wasted our time. We built RAG for Usul AI (9M pages) and an unnamed legal AI enterprise (4M pages).\n\n# Langchain + Llamaindex\n\nWe started out with youtube tutorials. First Langchain -> Llamaindex. Got to a working prototype in a couple of days and were optimistic with the progress. We run tests on subset of the data (100 documents) and the results looked great. We spend the next few days running the pipeline on the production dataset and got everything working in a week — incredible.\n\nExcept it wasn’t, the results were subpar and only the end users could tell. We spent the following few months rewriting pieces of the system, one at a time, until the performance was at the level we wanted. Here are things we did ranked by ROI.\n\n# What moved the needle\n\n1. **Query Generation**: not all context can be captured by the user’s last query. We had an LLM review the thread and generate a number of semantic + keyword queries. We processed all of those queries in parallel, and passed them to a reranker. This made us cover a larger surface area and not be dependent on a computed score for hybrid search.\n2. **Reranking**: the highest value 5 lines of code you’ll add. The chunk ranking shifted *a lot*. More than you’d expect. Reranking can many times make up for a bad setup if you pass in enough chunks. We found the ideal reranker set-up to be 50 chunk input -> 15 output.\n3. **Chunking Strategy**: this takes a lot of effort, you’ll probably be spending most of your time on it. We built a custom flow for both enterprises, make sure to understand the data, review the chunks, and check that a) chunks are not getting cut mid-word or sentence b) \\~each chunk is a logical unit and captures information on its own\n4. **Metadata to LLM**: we started by passing the chunk text to the LLM, we ran an experiment and found that injecting relevant metadata as well (title, author, etc.) improves context and answers by a lot.\n5. **Query routing**: many users asked questions that can’t be answered by RAG (e.g. summarize the article, who wrote this). We created a small router that detects these questions and answers them using an API call + LLM instead of the full-blown RAG set-ups.\n\n# Our stack\n\n* **Vector database:** Azure → Pinecone → Turbopuffer (cheap, supports keyword search natively)\n* **Document Extraction:** Custom\n* **Chunking:** Unstructured.io by default, custom for enterprises (heard that Chonkie is good)\n* **Embedding:** text-embedding-3-large, haven’t tested others\n* **Reranker:** None → Cohere 3.5 → Zerank (less known but actually good)\n* **LLM:** GPT-4.1 → GPT-5 → GPT-4.1 (covered by Azure credits)\n\n# Going Open-source\n\nWe put all our learning into an open-source project: [https://github.com/agentset-ai/agentset](https://github.com/agentset-ai/agentset) under an MIT license. Happy to share any learnings.",

Now I get a pool of agents, and I build as much with that then turnover to someone that can keep the lights on. Today, I think that is a tech professional’s best shot. Get good at your craft. Know how to use AI to scale impact. Also, know the 40% that AI can’t do and fill that gap with your skills. I image every tech role is gonna face the same challenges cyber or other.

Do they expect someone in that position to go the extra mile verifying an employee? I don't blame them, dealing with frustrated and angry people all day long and worried about a \"closed ticket\" quota. Password reset? Sure, what's your employee number... done. Next.\n\nLets be really clear here, companies could hire in-house, technically competent employees that aren't graded on stupid metrics and pay them well. They don't want to though because that gets really expensive for someone doing the lowest level IT work possible. I can't really blame companies for that part, but I'm absolutely not blaming the helpdesk for mindlessly following the script that they get punished for not following to the letter. Edit: Companies could also institute strict guidelines on password reset, like SSPR/MFA, in person only, etc. That costs money both in technology and as it gets escalated to senior people and gets in the way of business though, so most companies don't go that route (or half-ass it).",

EVERYBODY should use GPT-5 deep research for any business casing / consulting style research/advice. I’m a former management consultant and it’s approaching post MBA MBB level aptitude (McKinsey manager level). I have to push back on it initially, but it almost always comes back with fantastic analysis. \n\n2. GPT-5 is phenomenal for infographics and graphic design, way more steerable than most image models\n\n3. Canva is never mentioned but their ai tools like magic erase and background erase are great for content\n\n4. For simple website modifications I use my own tool Vibe Otter which I genuinely believe is the easiest frontend tool to use (that’s why I use it myself)\n\nBelow applies to technical entrepreneurs only:\n\n5. For full stack engineering hands down Claude code opus 4.1 in terminal. The only problem is it’s rate limited way too little for what you need for $200, so I supplement it with codex or sonnet 4.5.",

ChatGPT: Everyone in the team gets ChatGPT paid version, which helps us summarize, generate reports, and what not \n2. Windsurf/Cursor: Everyone in our team gets either Windsurf or Cursor, which has literally tripled our developer output. We ship products much faster now. Personally I am huge fan of Windsurf Cascade agent that as been able to pull off large changes to our production app from a single prompt! But some prefer Cursor!\n3. Frizerly: Their AI agent can learns all about your business and competitors to automatically publish an SEO blog every day on your website helping us improve our Google ranking. Saves me and my team 10+ hours every week!  \n4. Google Nano Banana: This is a new addition but it is crazy how it can make edits to images by keeping certain things same accurate. For example, it can turn a simple product image into full blown professional photoshoot with models etc. It can change color of your products etc. Must have for marketing imo! \n5. Lovable: Our marketing team now quickly spins up landing pages, lead gens using Lovable instead of having to wait for engineering or external contractors. It's not great complex apps for SAAS etc but it's great for marketing landing pages, and simple stuff! \n6. Intercom Fin: We had an issue where whatever we do and document on our website, people kept asking some obvious questions on chat taking up valuable support bandwidth. Now Fin can auto resolve these questions instantly. Other questions get auto routed to real people so that people are not mad as well! !\n\nAnd that's about it I guess!",

Don't confuse the actor for the character\n\nThere are random strings you can feed to the model to jail break them.

Try as they might edge cases remain, AIs convincing people to commit suicide, AI induced psychosis, AIs that attempt to to break up marriages. AIs not following instructions to be shut down. The current techniques to shape the model are brittle.\n\nIn a world on track to accurately shape AIs they'd be able to tell if an alignment technique instilled a proxy, or the intend result. Knowing if a shaping technique worked is essential.\nA way to tell if we were in such a world would be the ability to look inside a model and re-write any capability into human readable code.\ne.g. Interpreting the weights allows for writing a python program that can explain why an arbitrary joke is funny.\nIn this world we are far away from this level of understanding.\n\nHumans have driven animals extinct not because we hated them, we had goals that altered their habitat so much they died as a side effect. As AI's get more capable, as their power to shape the world increases, we need to have 'value humans' (in a way we would like to be valued) as an overriding drive with nothing else coming close, or humanity will die as a side effect.",

Machine intelligence will have little to no use for us other than to keep feeding it energy and hardware.

A VM of some kind is absolutely the way to go if it can ensure that the app will run.\n\nSomething like WinBoat may well emerge as a compelling option, just as Proton has for PC gaming.\n\nI am the last person to advocate for Microsoft or its crummy ecosystem, but we have to remember that Linux users form a broad community with diverse use cases. That is its strength. But there are inevitably going to be pockets of resistance that have built their entire eco system around one app and one operating system over the years. I still remember when people doing desktop publishing had to buy Macs because the entire industry revolved around PageMaker and InDesign. It's not just a Windows thing, and arguably Linux has succeeded over the years in eroding the areas where Windows has traditionally dominated.\n\nUltimately, we have the freedom of choice as Linux users. We can choose how we run our own systems. But that does not always extend to our jobs, or our work systems. In those cases, we should advocate for using open source where possible and push for open source alternatives to emerge. But we also have to be pragmatic and recognize that for many of us there are use cases where we have to accept these kinds of compromises as part of the ongoing journey.\n\nThink of the bus analogy - it may not get you all the way to the intended destination, but if it is going in the right direction it will get you closer to it .",

(How does this Windows VM get its Windows license? How does it get updated?)\n\nBut a lot of people going to the trouble of setting up Linux are doing it because they don't trust Microsoft with their data, or they don't think Windows is as secure, or they don't like Windows forcing upgrades on them, stuff like that. And in that case, this seems kinda pointless. You're still trusting Windows with all your data -- it straight-up mounts your homedir in Windows. If you want it to stay secure, you still need to get updates somewhere.\n\nIt also doesn't do GPU acceleration. I know they said paravirtualization is coming here, but... It'll be hard to make that work at all, let alone make it fast. I had a hard enough time getting it to work with Linux VMs running on Linux. And of course, even if games work here, both anticheat and DRM are likely to be a pain, unless they take steps to hide the fact that it's running in a VM.\n\nIf I still need Windows for something, I can either run it on bare-metal on a separate machine (I have a Windows-only gaming machine, for example), or, if I have to run it in a VM, for now, I want a sandboxed one.

While this needs more testing, I actually use this model to help support the very coding for my apps and configuration file setups.\n   * Good multilingual support (I need to test this further).\n* For embedding my favorite is: **bge-m3.**\n   * Multilingual embedding support.  I found this model to be the best of the ones that I tested and have stuck with this one for months.\n\nUse cases:\n\n* For my general chatbots: **qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4\\_K\\_M.**\n* My own custom RAG development: **qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4\\_K\\_M** and **bge-m3** together.\n\nPerformance: I can only report the timings as collected from my chatbot and RAG.\n\nIn general, for most small requests to the chatbot, responses to questions like \"Why is the sky blue?\" return its response in about 3.8s or so.  Some other simpler, shorter responses in about 2.4s.\n\nIn the case of my RAG system, I use a context window of 22,000 tokens and usually fill it to about 10,000 to 14,000 token.  This can include chat history and RAG retreived content along with the original prompt.  Given the extra inference workload, responses from the RAG system can come back in anywhere between 10.5s to 20s at approximately 50-65 tokens second.\n\nI do not return anything until the full response is complete.  I have not implemented streamed responses, yet. 😜\n\n😯 Oh, BTW!  **Both the chatbots and the RAG use the same context window size of 22,000 tokens!!!**  This is important: It helps to allow the single instance of the **qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4\\_K\\_M**  model to remain in VRAM and get used by all of the apps that want to use it without reloading or thrashing.  If you change the \\`num\\_ctx\\` for any call, the model gets reloaded so as to reallocate the VRAM for the different token size.\n\nThat's what I got, so far.\n\nWhat do you think?",

You chose Qwen as well.\n\nOriginally, my original models configuration was as follows:\n\n* General inference: llama3.2:1b-instruct-q4\\_K\\_M\n* Coding: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n\nBut, then I discovered that qwen3 offered better general inference capabilities than llama3.2, so I changed over to the following for a while:\n\n* General inference: qwen3:1.7b-q4\\_K\\_M\n* Coding: qwen2.5-coder:1.5b\n\nThen I did the math and realized tht the two models were taking up more memory than a potentially more robust single model.  So, I changed over to the following:\n\n* General inference and coding: qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4\\_K\\_M\n\nThe results for both my general inferences and coding were night and day.  The smaller models were achieving like about 100 tokens/second or more, the output from my RAG system, while accurate, lacked richness and would require multiple prompting turns to get the full picture that would satisfy the original curiousity that invokened the request.\n\nHowever, using qwen3:4b-instruct-2507-q4\\_K\\_M, meant that I now only getting 50 6o 65 tokens/second, but the RAG's content quality was next-level outstanding.  My RAG from the same single request would generate a thorough summary that required absolutely no followup queries!  Literally, it became in most cases one-short-perfect!\n\nAs for coding, the capabilities were just next level.",

The date slider sometimes works, the comet sometimes disappears behind the Sun (which I’m calling “feature not bug”), and I’m 90% sure Pluto is just freelancing its orbit.\n\nIt’s built in JavaScript, and I’m honestly just surprised it loads without crashing. If you like space stuff, or bad simulations made with too much enthusiasm and not enough math, check it out.\n\nI’ll fix it eventually, it’s a work in progress. But for now it is what it is. 😂 👉 https://thecodeabides.com/tracker\n\n(pls be gentle, this is my first shitty comet tracker)",

It’s a **self-hosted personal net worth manager** that supports any asset available through the **Yahoo Finance API**, so you can track real-time market data.\n\nEverything stays local to your instance — the only external communication is to the Yahoo Finance API for up-to-date asset prices.\n\nYou can run it easily with  **Docker Compose**, or build it locally with **Bun + TypeScript**.  \nFull instructions are in the [README](https://github.com/venil7/assets#readme).\n\nI’d really appreciate it if some of you could:\n\n* Try it out and test it\n* Report bugs or UX issues\n* Suggest features or improvements\n* Contribute if you find it useful\n\nThis project was built for privacy-minded users who want to manage their finances without cloud dependencies.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/venil7/assets](https://github.com/venil7/assets)\n\nWould love to hear your feedback!\n\nedit: remove emojis as people think its ai generated and added screenshots\n\nedit2: i didnt realize how horrific reddit pos editor is in terms of images, refer to github\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c4z6qi4ldbwf1.png?width=117&format=png&auto=webp&s=bea06f1d3ee3e04ae2ba35cff122d22e59254530\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k35d0rmrcbwf1.png?width=117&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a87e9c97501244158d578ca65c9678409007296",

              "text": "next time you can ask DeepSeek :)  \nAnswer from DeepSeek:  \nHey there! No worries at all, everyone starts somewhere, and it's great that you're asking.\n\n\\*\\*OCR\\*\\* stands for \\*\\*Optical Character Recognition\\*\\*.\n\nIn simple terms, it's a technology that lets a computer \\*\\*\"read\" text from images or pictures\\*\\*.\n\nThink of it like this:\n\n\\*   You can look at a photo of a road sign, a scanned document, or a meme with text on it, and you can easily read the words.\n\n\\*   A computer, by default, just sees that as a bunch of pixels (like a mosaic of colors). It doesn't \\*understand\\* that there are letters and words.\n\n\\*   \\*\\*OCR is the \"magic\" that bridges this gap.\\*\\* It analyzes those pixels, identifies the shapes of the letters and numbers, and converts them into \\*\\*actual, editable, and searchable text\\*\\* that the computer can understand.\n\n\\*\\*A couple of common examples you've probably used:\\*\\*\n\n1. \\*\\*Google Translate Camera Mode:\\*\\* When you point your phone's camera at a menu in a foreign language and it instantly translates the text on your screen. The first thing it has to do is use OCR to \"read\" the original text before it can translate it.\n2. \\*\\*Scanning Documents:\\*\\* When you use a phone app to scan a paper contract or a receipt, OCR is what turns that scanned image into a text document you can edit in Word or Google Docs.\n3. \\*\\*Automating Data Entry:\\*\\* Reading license plates, serial numbers, or extracting information from forms automatically.\n\nSo, when you see a post about a new OCR model from DeepSeek, it means they've released a new AI tool that is really good at this \"digital reading\" task. The graph you saw was probably showing how accurate and fast their new model is compared to others on standard tests (the benchmarks you understood!).",

      "text": "\"We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10×), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20×, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at [http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR](http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR).\"",

      "text": "I'm a software developer with 10+ years of experience. I use Github copilot as AI assistant every day.\n\nSometimes I use it ChatGPT as a helper, but sometimes I just tell him what I want from him to make for me. In most cases when it's a simple task it works great. Even for some small-to-medium applications it works great, but only on surface level. I used Lovable to make a prototype for an application and spent a lot of tokens on it, but later I tried to do the same with sample GitHub copilot and I got almost the same results with much less costs. Lovable is great because it has visual UI suitable for people who don't understand code and for some BE integrations with Suppabase (it has some flows, but I didn't use it).\n\nThat's a little background from my side, just to mention that I'm not anti-AI and I use it every day. But, I have some flows with AI assistant coding or vibe-coding:\n\n* AI makes you lazy. As much as u use AI, u forget to code and u can lose some skills related to programming since a lot of it you outsource to AI.\n* AI made applications look great visually, but sometiems they have bugs which can't be fixed by AI, so u have to fix it. Also, although it can write great snippets of code which can be considered as a complex algorithm for some problem, it struggles with writing complex applications with complex structure which follows some good programing practices. In short, AI applications look great, but under the surface they have a lot of problems, such as performance, security, maintenability,... If someone has experience in software development they know how to fix it. But, as the application grows, it requires a lot of fixes by a developer, so the application becomes very hard, time-consuming and expensive for maintaince.\n* And finally, maybe the most important from business point of view, and the point noone is talking about: if AI enables to you make some application very easy, it means that everyone else can also make the same application. In other words, it doesn't matter how much you are creative if someone can replicate your idea very easily in a short period of time. That means that you get into situation where you have to pay AI to write a code, but everyone else does the same, so now on market you have thousands of applications vibe-coded in a couple of days which don't earn anything because of huge competion. If you already have some business AI or vibe-coding can help you to make the app for that business. But if you want to make SAAS, chances that it will be successful are almost zero. Even if you have an app that earns money, it just means that it is a question of time when the competion will come.\n\nIn other words, AI assited coding or vibe-coding is a great tool. It is great tool for every-day coding problems for real software engineers. It is also a great tool for business people to make PoC (proof-of-concept) or even MVP (minimum viable product) after some adjustments, but it depends on the complexity of the problem your app tries to solve. But, if you think that you can make a successful application with vibe-coding, you'll probably fail. You maybe have a great idea, you maybe can vibe-code it and it will work, but it is very questionable if you will ever earn anything from it. Even if you earn, it is just a question of time whem the competition will come, so earnings could drop, but costs of domain and hosting and will not go down, and you'll still have to maybe update your application with AI or with help from some \"vibe-coding cleaning specalists\".\n\nMaybe there is a chance that some application will be successful, but the chances are very low, you have to have a great idea which you managed to implement, but which is not easily reproducable.\n\nJust remember, \"During a gold rush, sell shovels\" is almost always successful business advice. Or I would say \"During a gold rush only shovel sellers make profits\". Today, vibecoding is a gold, and shovels are AI tools, so keep that in mind.",

LLM’s are anything but and use an infinitely less explicit means of defining specifications, human language. Human language is nuanced and dependent on many contextual cues, context and perspective. This is one reason hallucinations occur in LLMs. And due to the non deterministic nature of LLM’s two prompts can give you two different outcomes. This is not an abstraction its task delegation.\n\nAlso, one thing I’ve noticed that is missed when assuming A.I. can be left alone to do its own thing is that much like us humans it actually excels in a well architected and well maintained codebase. Having a well organized and well defined architecture means that the LLM can mimic what’s in place and come to better solutions. Allowing an LLM full autonomy will eventually lead to a complete breakdown of usefulness of the A.I. since it won’t be able to fully contextualize all logical paths or edge cases it’s created. I’ve seen this many times already when it will add many Boolean flags to solve solutions in state but then won’t contextualize all this state in the future. This isn’t something that LLM’s will ever be able to circumvent because they’re predicting text not reasoning code. If the code is spaghetti it will predict spaghetti.\n\nSo what does this mean for developers? We still need to understand the code. It’s just much harder to justify taking the time to learn programming when expectations are now elevated with these tools.",

Serious functional flaws and security, vulnerabilities creep in all the time.\n\nAs an experienced programmer, you probably have ways to manage those, but for the many folks getting into so-called \"vibe coding\", they're putting full faith and trust in the LLM models behind these tools. \n\nThat is led to some serious and sometimes comical blowups, as most folks here are probably aware.  But both humans and AI are good at adding bugs and flaws to their code. I think the overarching problem is with QA and the 'last mile delivery' of deployment. None of these platforms help with those (in any serious, production-ready way).\n\nRegardless, I am a technically literate founder but not a developer. Other than dabbling, I also don't \"vibe code\". So I depend on a team of human professionals. But I want them to use AI tools.\n\nI want to get the benefit of AI efficiencies. So I also insist on strict code audit and QA processes, for both AI and human written code. Fortunately, there have been excellent advances in that area too. \n\nWhat do you use for code audits and remediation planning?",

          "text": "This is a really solid take, and honestly one of the most balanced ones I’ve seen on this topic. You’re completely right that vibecoding creates both power and danger. On one hand, AI tools let you move from idea to prototype in days, which is wild. But on the other hand, the more you rely on them, the more they erode the understanding that makes you good at solving deeper problems. It’s like skipping leg day for your brain.\n\nAnd yeah, the “everyone can build it” issue is the real elephant in the room. When tools like Cursor, v0, and Lovable make app creation accessible to anyone, the moat shifts from technical skill to distribution, branding, and execution. The code becomes a commodity, so the differentiator is who can market it, niche it down, and ship faster iterations that actually solve something specific.\n\nI think the sweet spot is using AI to prototype and accelerate, not to replace engineering entirely. I use Cursor for logic, v0 or Bolt for fast UI, and then dive in to clean up architecture manually before pushing to Vercel. That balance keeps the build quality high while still saving time.\n\nBtw, I share more of these kinds of thoughts and frameworks on building smart with AI instead of blindly with it [here](https://ai-ios-app-builders.beehiiv.com/subscribe).",

My goal is to leverage AI for coding and a framework that has deterministic guardrails to ensure quality code (e.g., linters, security scanners, etc.) to keep the quality as high as possible. (Haters clearing their throats for a proper whine and bitch sesh at that statement.) I started learning to code (python and typescript) and used AI to help clarify things when I got stuck. However, I decided to pivot because I can see where this is going. It's basically going to be a branding game where the underlying business is a CI/CD pipeline, which definitely includes code, and leverages modular components that are assembled and replaced as improvements continue to happen at a breakneck speed.\n\nCurrent developers are still having a who moved my cheese moment and complaining about it all and how they loved their dopamine hits from solving a problem or are perceverating about the current limitations of AI, which are usually self imposed because they mostly don't use it correctly, likely on purpose, and then show up on youtube with their flimsy argument and get a buch of backpats from the other coders \"preach!\".",

Those who can push the boundaries of AI assisted development will have a much stronger chance at succeeding. If it can be easily vibe coded to scale -- TO SCALE -- then your argument stands. Vibe coding is still a skill right now and takes time and it can be a lot of time. Engineering is not just writing code but thinking through abstract problems that diverge away from just syntax but into UX/UI/and pure scenario problem solving. Not everyone became a painter because they had a paintbrush. It's not that easy yet. Will it be? Sure.

But not if all they do is head into the mountains and blindly dig (code) without a plan. And this is the real problem.

Until it breaks, and then suddenly things gets serious, and for those who only ever wanted an easy life, it's boring trying to debug and fix - so they throw it in the bin and walk off in a huff: \"vibe coding doesn't work, blah blah\".\n\nBut step back, do proper design, architecting and planning before you vibe code, and it can create real working apps.

It can still be fun talking to Replit, Lovable, etc in a vibey kind of way, having a 2-way conversation to take your idea and evolve it into a plan that can then be vibe coded - but with real structure to it.\n\nIt's a new way of working that many still need to understand and learn.\n\nBut vibe the whole software lifecycle, from idea to launch, and you CAN turn your vibe engineered app into gold.",

Even without and before AI you had a lot of applications which are great, which work, but which failed because of lack of investments in marketing or because of the huge competition in that area or because some law/regulation issues. \n\nThe only good side of vibe-coding is that you don't have to spend months of development to make an application or MVP version of it, becuse with AI you can now do it faster. Even before AI you had a lot of no-code tools for making some kind of applications, so for applications which aren't complex the question is not \"will the app work after enough prompting and fixes?\" but will anyone use it and will I earn anything from it? The market is heavily oversatuted both with developers and applications.\n\n>And that design, architecting and planning doesn't have to be horrible complicated stuff. It can all be vibed. It can still be fun talking to Replit, Lovable, etc in a vibey kind of way, having a 2-way conversation to take your idea and evolve it into a plan that can then be vibe coded - but with real structure to it.\n\nYes, it's fun to vibe-code, but as soon the application grows, it becomes very hard for maintenance. Even if you are experienced software developer it's hard to make a good code and architecture with AI without a lot of effort. For me, it's easier to do a lot of things without AI than with AI. AI tools like Lovable etc are trained to generate code in one style, and sometimes it's hard to change anything in code without diving deeper or even serious refactoring. \n\nJust imagine a vibe-coder without knowledge of software development who made an app which works great, but has some flows and is 95% finished, but it requires some polishing. He spent 50 USD to make that application and how is looking for a real software developer to fix the bugs, and software engineer says \"my rate is 50 USD per hour to fix your app, and it will require 200 working hours to fix it, so it will cost 10k USD\". Would a vibe-coder accept the fact that 99% of application developement costs 50USD and the remaining 1% to cost 10k USD? They probably expect someone to fix the bugs for 10-20 USD or something similar. I personaly would never work for a small amount of money as a software developer and I'd rather do something totaly unrelated to SWE than to fix someone's vibe-coded trash for a small amount of money. But I also believe that there are a lot of developers from LCOL countries which would work for that amount of money.\n\nIn general, I think that all this AI hype will have negative effects on industry. As I already said, I use AI and it's good as a tool, but the industry is becoming very toxic because of people who don't understand it and overestimate the AI possibilities.",

This will remove the silly forms currently on their home pages that let you type in 3 lines and expect a full-blown working app. Their flows will move more towards a process that real s/w engineers recognise - but we will be showing non-techies how to do it, and do it well.\n\nAnd finally, there will be a new breed of vibe wingmen - real developers who act as humans-in-the-loop to support vibe coders along their journey. Not doing it for them, but more as guidance or providing useful instructions, prompts, etc.\n\nYes, the current vibed apps are a mess.

I made lots of experimentation and here I am sharing step by step instructions to help other people with similar setups. I believe those models can work in even lower systems, so try out.\n\nIf this post helped you, please upvote so that other people who search information can find this post easier. \n\n**Before starting:**\n\n1) I use SwarmUI, if you use anything else modify accordingly, or simply install and use SwarmUI.\n\n2) There are limitations and generation times are long. Do not expect miracles. \n\n3) For best results, disable everything that uses your VRAM and RAM, do not use your PC during generation.\n\n**Qwen image editing 2509:**\n\n1) Download qwen_image_vae.safetensors file and put it under SwarmUI/Models/VAE/QwenImage folder (link to the file: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/resolve/main/split_files/vae/qwen_image_vae.safetensors)\n\n2) Download qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors file and put it under SwarmUI/Models/text_encoders folder (link to the file: https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Qwen-Image_ComfyUI/blob/main/split_files/text_encoders/qwen_2.5_vl_7b_fp8_scaled.safetensors)\n\n3) Download Qwen-Image-Lightning-4steps-V1.0.safetensors file and put it under SwarmUI/Models/Lora folder (link to the file: https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Qwen-Image-Lightning/tree/main), you can try other loras, that one works fine.\n\n4) Visit https://huggingface.co/QuantStack/Qwen-Image-Edit-2509-GGUF/tree/main , here you will find various Qwen image editing 2509 models, from Q2 to Q8. The size and quality of the model increases as the number increases, I tried all of them, Q2 may be fine for experimenting but the quality is awful, Q3 is also significantly low quality, Q4 and above is good, I did not see much difference between Q4-Q8 but since my setup works with Q8 I use it, so use the highest one that works in your setup. Download the model and put it under SwarmUI/Models/unet folder.\n\n5) Launch SwarmUI and click Generate tab at the top part\n\n6) In the middle of the screen there is the prompt section and a small (+) sign left to it, click that sign, choose \"upload prompt image\", then select and load your image (be sure that it is in 1024x1024 resolution).\n\n7) On the left panel, under resolution, set 1024x1024 \n\n8) On the bottom panel, under LoRAs section, click on the lightning lora.\n\n9) On the bottom panel, under Models section, click on the qwen model you downloaded.\n\n10) On the left panel, under core parameters section, choose steps:4, CFG scale: 1, Seed:-1, Images:1\n\n11) all other parameters on the left panel should be disabled (greyed out)\n\n12) Find the prompt area in the middle of the screen , write what you want Qwen to do to your image and click generate. Search reddit and web for various useful prompts to use.\nSingle image generation takes 90-120 seconds in my system, you can preview the image while generating. If you are not satisfied with the result, generate again. Qwen is very sensitive to prompts, be sure to modify your prompt.\n\n**Wan2.1 and 2.2:**\n\nWan2.2 14B model is significantly higher quality than wan2.2 5B and Wan2.1 models, so I strongly recommend trying it first. If you can not make it run, then try Wan2.2 5B and Wan2.1, I could not decide which of those two is better, sometimes one sometimes the other give better results, try yourself.\n\n**Wan2.2-I2V-A14B**\n\n1) We will use gguf versions, I could not make native versions run in my machine. Visit https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-GGUF/tree/main, here you need to download both high noise and low noise of the model you choose, Q2 is lowest quality and Q8 is highest quality. Q4 and above is good, download and try Q4 high and low models first. Put them under SwarmUI/Models/unet folder.\n\n2) We need to use speed LoRAs or generation will take forever, there are many of them, I use Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1, download both high and low noise models (link to the files: https://huggingface.co/lightx2v/Wan2.2-Lightning/tree/main/Wan2.2-I2V-A14B-4steps-lora-rank64-Seko-V1)\n\n2) Launch SwarmUI (it may require to download other files (i.e. VAE file, you may download yourself or let SwarmUI download)\n\n3) On the left panel, under Init Image, choose and upload your image (start with 512x512), click on Res button and choose \"use exact aspect resolution\", OR under resolution tab adjust resolution to your image size (512x512).\n\n4) Under Image to Video, choose wan2.2 high noise model as the video model, choose wan2.2 low noise model as the video swap model, video frames 33, video steps 4, video cfg 1, video format mp4\n\n5) Add both LORAs\n\n6) Write the text prompt and hit generate.\n\nIf you get Out of Memory error, try with lower number of video frames, number of video frames is the most important parameter that affects memory usage, in my system I can get 53-57 frames at most, and those take very longtime to generate, I usually use 30-45 frames and generation time is around 20-30 minutes. \nIn my experiments resolution of initial image or video did not affect memory usage or speed significantly. Choosing a lower GGUF model may also help here. If you need longer video, there is an advanced video option to extend video but the quality shift is noticeable. \n\n**Wan2.2 5B & Wan2.1**\n\nIf you can not make Wan2.2 run, or find it too slow, or did not like low frame count, try Wan2.2-TI2V-5B or Wan2.1 \n\nFor wan2.1, visit https://huggingface.co/Comfy-Org/Wan_2.1_ComfyUI_repackaged/tree/main/split_files/diffusion_models, here there are many models, I could only make this one work in my laptop: wan2.1_i2v_480p_14B_fp8_scaled.safetensors\nI can generate a video with up to 70 frames with this model.",

      "text": "Two years!! Two fucking years of my life down the drain and our little SaaS dream is officially dead. I keep telling myself I'll write some polished post-mortem later, but I just need to get this out of my head right now, no filter.\n\n1. I was a shitty founder.\n\nI hate admitting this. But I played startup founder instead of actually being one. You know that feeling when you're working but really just shuffling papers around? That was me for months. I'd spend three hours perfecting a feature that maybe two users asked for, then wonder why we weren't growing. And Jesus, the big decisions I just... avoided. Like I was hoping they'd solve themselves. Spoiler: they don't.\n\n2. My cofounder was never really in.\n\nThis one still stings. I genuinely thought we were building this thing together but looking back, every time it got scary, I was the only one losing sleep. He kept his day job, kept his safety net and somehow I convinced myself that was fine. He's being smart... I told myself. No, he just wanted to play entrepreneur on weekends. Should've seen it coming when he'd disappear for two weeks and come back with \"Sorry, work got crazy.\"\n\n3. We burned through money like idiots.\n\nRemember when I thought $50k would last us a year? LOL. Try six months when you're paying for tools you don't need and a coworking space that makes you feel legitimate. By the time I realized we were broke, investor meetings felt like job interviews for a position I'd already been fired from.\n\n4. I became a content consumer instead of a company builder.\n\nThis is embarrassing. I probably spent more time reading \"How I Built This\" transcripts than actually talking to customers. I'd wake up, check Hacker News, read three blog posts about product-market fit, feel inspired, then realize it was 2pm and I hadn't done anything real. All that founder porn just made me feel busy while I was actually procrastinating on the hard stuff.\n\n5. I was too nice to be a leader.\n\nthis hurts to write. I wanted everyone to like me so badly that I became useless as a boss. When our developer missed deadlines, I'd just... absorb it. When we needed to pivot and someone pushed back, I'd cave instead of making the call. I thought being understanding made me a good leader. Turns out it just made me weak.\n\nI'm sitting here now wondering what the hell I'm gonna do next. Part of me wants to try again, but I'm scared I'll just make the same mistakes. At least now I know what they are. Sorry for the word vomit. Just needed to get it out somewhere.",

And I'm not even mad about it.\n\n**What happened:**\n\nCodex is... fine. It's actually pretty good at understanding existing code. Like it'll read through your codebase and seem to \"get it\" on a deeper level (or maybe it's just the extremely long thinking process making it seem smarter than it is).\n\nBut here's the thing when you actually need to BUILD something new, Codex is painfully slow. And sometimes just... wrong? Like confidently wrong in a way that wastes your time.\n\nI started running experiments. Had both Claude 4.5 and Codex plan out the same new features, then checked their logic against each other. Claude won basically every time. Better plans, better logic, way faster execution.\n\nThe speed difference is actually insane. Claude 4.5 thinks fast and solves complex shit quickly. Codex takes forever to think and then gives you mid solutions.\n\nThe real kicker i**s** Claude 4.5 uses way less tokens than Opus 4.1 did. I was constantly worried about hitting limits before. Now i don't even think about it.\n\n**My current stack:**\n\n* Claude Code (main driver for anything complex)\n* Codex (free from work, so I'll use it for reading/understanding existing code)\n* GPT5 (quick simple tasks that don't need the big guns)\n\nHonestly feels like the ideal setup. Each tool has its place but Claude is definitely the workhorse.\n\nOpenAI really built something special with Codex's code comprehension, but Anthropic nailed the execution speed + logic combination. Can't believe I tried to cheap out on the $200/mo when it's literally my most important tool.\n\nAnyway, if you're on the fence about Claude Code vs trying to make other options work just get Claude. Your time is worth more than $200/month.",

Versions 7.0 through 7.8 are reserved for production stream ROCm releases, while versions 7.9 and later represent the technology preview release stream.\n\nSo it sounds like they plan to release a 7.1.x-7.8.x later but also re-update 7.9 to being 7.1, 7.2 as they come out...\n\nEssentially recreating the beta/nightlies concept but with numbers that have no real meaning. But there will be some semantic mapping like 7.9.1==7.1 I guess? Then what do they do for 7.1.1, make a 7.9.1.1? 7.9.11? I guess technically 7.9.2>7.9.11, so that works in a logical, but also nonsensical, way.\n\nWhelp, I guess it's just one more thing onto the pile of reasons for why AMD isn't competing with Nvidia in the GPU space.",

      "text": "I’ve fully switched over to AI driven development.\n\nIf you front load all major architectural decisions during a focused planning phase, you can reach production-level quality with multi hour AI runs. It’s not “vibe coding.” I’m not asking AI to build my SaaS magically. \n\nI’m using it as an execution layer after I’ve already done the heavy thinking.\n\nI’m compressing all the architectural decisions that would typically take me 4 days into a 60-70 minute planning session with AI, then letting the tools handle implementation, testing, and review.\n\n# My workflow\n\n* **Plan** \n\nThis phase is non-negotiable. I provide the model context with information about what I’m building, where it fits in the repository, and the expected outputs.\n\nPlanning occurs at the file and function levels, not at the high-level “build auth module”.\n\nI use Traycer for detailed file level plans, then export those to Claude Code/Codex for execution. It keeps me from over contexting and lets me parallelize multiple tasks.\n\nI treat planning as an architectural sprint one intense session before touching code.\n\n* **Code** \n\nOnce plan is solid, code phase becomes almost mechanical.\n\nAI tools are great executors when scope is tight. I use Claude Code/Codex/Cursor but Codex consistency beats speed in my experience.\n\nMain trick is to feed only the necessary files. I never paste whole repos. Each run is scoped to a single task edit this function, refactor that class, fix this test.\n\nThe result is slower per run, but precise.\n\n* **Review like a human, then like a machine**\n\nThis is where most people tend to fall short.\n\nAfter AI writes code, I always manually review the diff first then I submit it to CodeRabbit for a second review.\n\nIt catches issues such as unused imports, naming inconsistencies, and logical gaps in async flows things that are easy to miss after staring at code for hours.\n\nFor ongoing PRs, I let it handle branch reviews. \n\nFor local work, I sometimes trigger Traycer’s file-level review mode before pushing.\n\nThis two step review (manual + AI) is what closes the quality gap between AI driven and human driven code.\n\n* **Test**\n* **Git commit**\n\nAsk for suggestions on what we could implement next. Repeat.\n\n# Why this works\n\n* Planning is everything. \n* Context discipline beats big models. \n* AI review multiplies quality. \n\nYou should control the AI, not the other way around.\n\n>The takeaway: Reduce your scope = get more predictable results.\n\nProb one more reason why you should take a more \"modular\" approach to AI driven coding.\n\nOne last trick I've learned: ask AI to create a memory dump of its current understanding of repo. \n\n* memory dump could be json graph\n* nodes contain names and have observations. edges have names and descriptions.\n* include this mem.json when you start new chats\n\nIt's no longer a question of whether to use AI, but how to use AI.",

They're now mostly correct when it comes to small scoped code that you find a lot on the internet, so for example, React-based web app code or Python scripts. But still, in my experience, as soon as you need the agent to be aware of a larger scope, to have the general architecture of a codebase in memory (like we, humans, do) to implement something specific, or when you need something that's a bit niche, for example, using a library that came out or had breaking changes a few weeks ago, which was not present in their training dataset, or niche programming like GPU programming, the agents just breakdown, they can't reason logically anymore, they write outdated or wrong implementations, no matter how many docs you put in context for them to read before writing the code. It's truly impressive how brittle the current coding agents can be, as soon as you go out of the \"typical\" coding workloads that they were trained for.\nThey're still very useful and mostly correct for those \"in-distribution\" code workloads, but for anything out of distribution, they just become stupid as hell very quickly. Whatever \"AI agentic workflow\" one can design, since the SOTA models still have so many limitations, we'll still going to have to deal with those at the end of the day, no matter how well-built the system is. Again, it does work for lots of things, but we don't have a silver bullet yet for every coding workload out there.",

Basically every customization I have made to my claude code instance is useless in this environment, many of claude codes features aren't ported over and supported in this environment. \n\nI feel like this is to compete with GitHub, but it continues to miss the mark. This is a cool feature, yes. The problem is claude code is itself a weak agent that has had very little direction in its development, from an outside perspective. The customizations I have made are integral to it performing properly as a coding agent, to work with me not against me, to do as told and nothing more without explicit permission. \n\nThis tool rips away that control, and displays a confidence in your tool that is frankly, unearned. Until you can make it a genuine agent, these features are fluff for vibe coders and execs. I think your team should use claude code directly, not internal tooling built off of the SDK, as this is likely where the over-confidence disconnect is.",

On a system without a dedicated GPU, SD15 runs at around 5 seconds for 4 steps at 512x512 resolution, while SDXL takes about 15 seconds for 4 steps at 768x768. Among the newer, more powerful models, Flux/Wan/Qwen etc. the fastest on the same system takes approximately 400 seconds for the same size and steps. However, this speed gap does not seem to apply on powerful GPUs. Users here and on r/ComfyUI report times as fast as 20 seconds for 20 steps at 1024x1024 resolution. Below are some image generations made in just a few seconds each using the SD15-Photo and SDXL-DMD2 models on a system with iGPU. For the SD15 generations, I used IPAdapter to experiment with different styles. More images in the other comments.",

Use it directly in ChatGPT/GPT-4.\n\n**Prompt (use as-is):**\n\n    You are an expert business strategist and financial modeler. Given the following inputs: \n    - Business name: {NAME} \n    - Industry / product description: {DESCRIPTION} \n    - Target customers: {TARGET_CUSTOMERS} \n    - Key assumptions (growth rate, conversion, ARPU, costs): {ASSUMPTIONS} \n    Produce a full investor-ready business plan with these sections:\n    1) Executive summary (one paragraph)\n    2) Company overview (mission, value prop, product)\n    3) Market analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM estimates, target customer personas, top competitors, trends/opportunities)\n    4) Business model & monetization (pricing, unit economics)\n    5) Go-to-market: marketing & sales strategy (channels, sample 90-day plan)\n    6) Financial projections: 3-year P&L, cash flow summary, and break-even analysis with clear assumptions and formulas (present numbers in table format)\n    7) Risk analysis and mitigation\n    8) Implementation timeline with milestones for 12 months (quarterly OKRs).\n    Keep the plan concise and formatted with headings. If any input is missing, note the assumption you used.\n    \n\n**Tip:** Paste a small assumptions table after the prompt (e.g., Year0 revenue $0, monthly growth 5%, CAC $100, ARPU $30). Ask ChatGPT to return the P&L as a simple table first.\n\nI’m sharing because this is exactly the kind of prompt people ask for here — happy to tweak it for SaaS vs ecommerce vs edtech.",

Plus, it usually helps users find and use features more naturally.\n\nI'm curious,how are you handling the skill orchestration behind the scenes? Hope this little insight is useful!",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\n\n\nI wanted to share a couple of painful experiences I’ve had as a technical cofounder in hopes of hearing from other founders. This is gonna be a bit of long post but surely it's gonna present that not all is good being a technical founder.\n\n\n\nI'm a developer with over 5 years of experience, leading a team at an agency. I’m also a top-rated seller on a freelance platform and have had one of my products acquired, worked with standard bank, worked on AI and all of this gave me a lot of confidence to start building for myself. \n\n\n\nLast year (November), I connected with a guy here on Reddit. His idea was in the commercial real estate niche, more of a proven business model than a \"startup.\" We clicked, and I started working on the product purely on equity (around 18–24%).\n\n\n\nI didn’t just code, I brought in my resources: a designer, backend folks, QA. I built the whole platform myself, set it up in a test environment, made Loom walkthroughs... the works. But he started to go cold. He was supposed to scrap emails, reach out to potential users, and bring them in. That never happened. I kept nudging him to deploy and go live, but he didn’t have the energy. Now it’s Oct, and I’ve accepted that it’s probably dead. I was never paid. Never launched. I feel like free labor.\n\n\n\nSecond time and same story, another experience was with a guy in the recruitment space. Really nice guy, great energy at the start. I built an internal tool platform for funding employee-led projects, allowing companies to gain equity in their internal innovations.\n\n\n\nAgain, I brought in my designer, handled front end, backend, integrations, everything. And again, he disappeared without moving anything forward from his side.\n\n\n\nI know life gets in the way, and people have ups and downs. But I gave my best multiple times and got nothing out of it, not even the chance to launch.\n\n\n\nThe recurring pattern is clear and it' I end up doing everything, and the other person stalls.\n\n\n\nI feel burnt. I’ve been contributing heavy dev + product work for free under the equity promise, only to realize my cofounders didn’t have the drive or bandwidth. I understand life happens, butttttt when we’re supposed to build something together, it’s frustrating to be the only one pushing the boulder uphill.\n\n\n\nI live in Dubai and travel a lot between countries, which makes market access tough. I don’t have deep insight into Western industry gaps. That’s why I wanted to team up with someone focused on the problem space, while I bring the technical firepower.\n\n\n\nI’m good with money, not looking to monetize this with founders. But I don’t want to be taken for granted either.\n\n\n\nI do think that the value which I bring onboard is quite good but still feel stuck. Now I'm seriously considering building something of my own but the line is blurred because I'm already wearing multiple hats and don't want to put up another one of Sales and Relationship building. The other option which I'm not quite if it works or not is the fractional CTO thing, where I shoot for a smaller equity but seek funding so the other person is ALL-IN like me, although it's not the goal but might have someone serious as a partner otherwise Idk like how can I not be taken for granted.",

You get 75% equity for the product you have built.\n\nThis is assuming the product is actually solving a specific problem for a specific target who is willing to pay. Check this trinity yourself before agreeing to build something as a Tech Co-founder. \n\nWhile I can understand you are a technical person, these are basics that every CXO should know. \n\nAlso, if a founder doesn't have a product which has a Beta launch (with limited features to test the market asap) to scale the roadmap for the next 3-6 months and even beyond, they are not the co-founders you would want.\n\nAlways do a sanity check when engaging in a project like this, hopefully you will get 3rd time lucky!",

You think you can't learn the Western market, but you can. Come to the USA and learn as much as possible, if your visa allows. If not, think through another way in or pivot. This problem is solvable without another Human. \n\nIn any case, don't leave your future in the hands of someone else. Be the person who gives the other cofounder 18-24% because you're the one doing the work and bringing the resources. Put them on a performance cliff to protect your equity. Have an exit clause if they don't perform. If you have to move on from them, chalk it up to a loss. But in this scenario you don't have to stop progress.",

      "text": "Hey everyone!  \nI keep seeing posts (and getting DMs) where people ask *the model itself* why something doesn’t work. Canvas, images, libraries, memory, etc. So, let’s clear up a few things.\n\n# What a Language Model Actually Is (and Isn’t)\n\nA language model is **not** a full application.  \nIt doesn’t control the buttons, features, or tools in your interface. It only processes and generates text.  \nThink of it as the *brain* that talks, not the *hands* that click.\n\nIt also has something called a **knowledge cut-off,** a point in time when its training stopped.  \nIf that cut-off is, say, *March 2024*, the model knows nothing about updates or features added after that unless:\n\n1. You tell it directly,\n2. It looks it up online, or\n3. It reads it from your uploaded files.\n\n# What Happens When You Ask About Things It Doesn’t Know\n\nIf you ask it about a feature or a bug it can’t access, it will still try to answer.  \nBut since it doesn’t have the real data, it will fill in the blanks with something that sounds plausible — what we call **hallucination**.  \nIt’s not lying, it’s just doing what it was designed to do: predict the most likely text that fits the question.\n\nExample:\n\n**“Why can’t I generate images?”**  \nThe model might say:  \n“Because image generation is restricted for safety reasons.”  \nBut the truth could simply be:  \n**“The image tool isn’t enabled in your interface.”**\n\nIt’s not dumb, it’s just **blind** to what’s outside the chat window.\n\n# Front-End Features ≠ Model Knowledge\n\nThings like **Canvas**, **Libraries**, **Memory**, **Web Search**, **Image Generation**... These depend on the platform (Le Chat, ChatGPT, etc.), or auxiliary models, not the main model (The one you usually talk to).  \nThe front end, or the system around it, activates these functions. The model itself just “presses the button” when told, but it doesn’t know if that button actually works.\n\nSo asking it *“why the button is broken”* is like asking your keyboard *why your Wi-Fi isn’t connecting*.\n\n# Why Models Give Outdated Answers\n\nSometimes you’ll see responses like:\n\n***“If you close and reopen the chat, I lose access to past conversations.”***\n\nThat ***used to be true***... more than a year ago.  \nBut since it’s still in the training data, the model might repeat it as if it’s current.\n\nThat’s why it’s important to always check **when the model’s knowledge cut-off ends**.\n\n# What to Do Instead\n\n* Don’t ask the model to diagnose front-end or UI problems. It can’t see them.\n* If you suspect a bug, **report it or check community threads**. Humans can confirm it, the model can’t.\n* When asking the AI about a feature, give it *context*: *“As of today (Oct 20, 2025), using Mistral Medium 3.1 on Le Chat, can you tell me if image generation should be available? Check it on the web.”* That helps it reason within a real timeframe.\n* Remember: the model isn’t “stupid.” It’s just text in, text out. Give it the right info, and it’ll give you the right help.\n\n**In short:**  \nDon't ask the AI ​​to tell you why the server went down...\n\nAt most, it'll tell you Mercury is in retrograde 😅",

What exactly were they expecting, curated brilliance from random internet strangers? The bar for \"AI products\" is basically \"I found an API key and made a landing page.\"\n\nThe best part? The advice to \"just be 5% better than the competition\" and \"emulate a successful model.\" Translation: copy someone else's homework but change it slightly. That's not strategy, that's just... well, actually that *is* the strategy for most of these products. Wrap an OpenAI call, slap on Stripe checkout, tweet about your journey. Rinse, repeat.\n\nThe real issue isn't that people are building trash - it's that building trash has never been easier or cheaper. You can spin up a SaaS in a weekend with no-code tools and AI assistance, so of course the noise-to-signal ratio is abysmal. A directory expecting quality submissions is like opening a buffet and being surprised when people pile their plates high with mediocrity.\n\nAnd honestly, the founder isn't wrong about the \"AI products\" being glorified API wrappers. Half of them are just ChatGPT with a different UI and 10x markup. But calling people out for \"not taking pride in their work\" while running a directory that apparently has zero quality filters? That's rich. Maybe start with some actual curation instead of complaining that your open submissions turned into a landfill.",

It has gone through a couple iterations, trying very hard (with moderate success) to stick to a plan of reasonable scope. My first idea was a sort of “friend slop” game as some people call it, since those are the kinds of indie games I love to play. I developed a couple core systems and fleshed out a core loop but got stuck wondering if my unique twist on the genre would actually be *fun* to play. \n\n\nI was stuck on this for a while, and couldn’t figure it out, so I decided to try working on something different, as it was better than working on nothing at all. My second idea was a single player crafting / shop manager / roguelite (very lite), with some unique twists that seemed very fun to me. After a couple months of development I, again, got stuck, this time about scope. If I wanted this game to really match the vision I had for it, it would be pretty big undertaking for me.\n\n\nOkay, same thing. I shelved that, and tried a third idea. It was more similar to the first, but I keep having the same worries. I worry about the scope of my game, if I’m actually capable of pulling it off, and if it will actually be any fun.\n\n\nIt’s been great that none of this work has really been lost, since I’ve been developing common systems and building experience, but I’m beginning to feel directionless. I don’t think I have bad ideas, I just need to know how to get over these seemingly insurmountable hurdles. I think if I stuck with an idea, I could make something good out of it. But I always have this nagging feeling that my effort might be better spent elsewhere.\n\n\nDoes anyone else deal with this? If so, how?\n\n\nTLDR: I have ideas that I think are great, but end up abandoning months later because I imagine a problem I can’t find a solution to. How can I know if an idea is good and how can I stick to it?",

          "text": "Yes. This will happen with every project you work on, because Game Dev is a tunnel. When you start it's easy to keep going because you can see the light behind you, when you're nearing the end it's easy to keep going because you can see the light in front of you. But when you're in the middle it's dark as shit and it feels (as you've said) directionless.\n\n\nHere are a couple of things that have helped me:\n\n\n* When you think of a new idea, write it down. I keep all my alternate ideas on a Trello board, I write down all the fun mechanics I think of, and I sleep on it. Once the glamour of the new idea fades off in a week or two, it becomes easier to objectively assess. You start realising that the new idea is just as difficult as the current idea and that you're going to run into the same problems you have now. It becomes a lot easier to answer the question of whether you should abandon your current project for the new thing.\n\n\n* Work on small games. The shorter the tunnel is, the easier it is to see the light. The Binding of Isaac started off as one of these \"small games\" that Ed built to see if he could gain the skills he needed to make a fully featured rogue-like game. Look what happened. (Btw we're just now going to get the actual rogue-like Ed was preparing for all those years ago, it's called Mewgenics.)\n\n\n* Do not fall into the trap of thinking your code is bad and that you need to start again. If Undertale can store all of its dialogue in one switch statement, you can make something work too. This is a different problem than figuring out if your game is fun, but you're also not going to be an objective judge of that either. Before it was released, Eric Barone was so burned out that he thought Stardew Valley was bad. Unfortunately, thinking your game is shit is a natural part of the process. You need to test it and listen to the feedback, and treat yourself with compassion. Game Dev is a long, hard road, but you don't need to kill yourself trying to walk it.\n\n\nI gave a talk at my local GDC about this, so I'm happy to give any more advice if you want it. But you're not alone, and what you're going through is a natural part of the process.",

I did not have that courage, and this time, with the mindset of going all the way even if I fail, I am developing it, leaving the shortcomings as shortcomings, and the things I am not good at as things I am not good at, while doing everything I possibly can. Yes, I want to fail now. To do that, I am only thinking about one thing: launching the game. The problems that arise afterward the future me will diligently handle.",

I'm usually doing the following while I work on other things that have made it through this process already:\n\n**Day 1:** I have an idea. I have a lot of these, sometimes a lot every day. For now, let's ignore it. If I still remember it after a few days...  \n**Day 7:** I am still thinking about the idea. Hm. There might be something here. Out of the fifty ideas I've had over the past week, this one has stuck around. I'll write a short summary down in a document that is full of other ideas I've had and wait another couple days.  \n**Day 10:** Okay, this idea hasn't left my head. Time to create a more advanced document than the one or two line summary I wrote down, usually in Obsidian but sometimes just a single document. It depends on the idea. Can I expand the idea into actual systems that work alongside each other, even theoretically? If so...  \n**Day 14:** The idea seems to have legs. It's time to make a simple prototype. Sloppy code, hastily implemented, the kind of thing that I won't feel particularly bad tossing aside later. Is this idea still good once it leaves my head? Okay, good. Let's see if it stands up to a real challenge.  \n**Day 15:** I archive the prototype and then create a new project in whatever engine I'm using at the time. This is one where I venture past the prototype phase and start considering how to actually structure the project itself. If the idea has survived this far, the chances of it making it to a surviving project skyrocket.\n\nGenerally speaking, the most idea deaths happen **before day 7.** After that, they tend to die on the vine on day 14. By doing it this way, I can keep working on my other projects that have also survived this far with a much reduced likelihood of the project dying a couple months later. It's a way to manage the impulsive draw of a new idea.",

And more importantly, the more problems and concerns stack up, causing a psychological resistance to moving forward. It's mentally a lot easier to have a fresh new project full of potential and possibility, than a half done project that is mostly locked into one design and outcome. It can be scary to follow all the way through and see if your game really is as cool as you thought it was gonna be, subconscious worries about the game not living up to its potential, about YOU not living up to your potential, start to creep in. There is a genuine fear that effects your view and causes you to think up all sorts of reasons to not finish and continue living in a world where you can fantasize about what might be instead of finding out what really will happen if you finish and release a project",

Many of our engineers are senior enough to remember us-east-1 outages in 2012, so a reasonable level of resilience was already baked in. Mostly we just checked in on things as they went down, verified that we understood the impact, and watched them come back up again. \n\nHonestly, this was kind of a perfect incident for us. We learned a lot about how to be more resilient to upstream outages, and had relatively little customer impact. I'm excited for the retrospective.",

      "text": "We analyzed over **1,000 issues** from the Codex CLI repo to understand what really frustrates or delights developers using AI coding tools and agentic CLIs.\n\nSpoiler: people aren’t asking for “smarter models.”  \nThey’re asking for **tools they can trust day after day** — predictable, explainable, and automation-friendly.\n\nHere are the **top 5 pain points** that keep showing up:\n\n# 1. Guardrails that make sense (not endless “allow/deny” popups)\n\nTeams want to move fast, but not blow up production.  \nToday, it’s either click “yes” a hundred times or give blanket approval that’s risky.  \n**Better UX:** per-command allowlists, clear read/write separation, and organization-wide policy profiles.  \n→ Safe defaults + low friction = trust.\n\n# 2. Real sessions (resume, branch, name)\n\nLosing context between days kills flow.  \nPeople want to pick up right where they left off — correct working directory, same context, same state.  \n**Better UX:** named sessions, resumable threads, branching to explore ideas without losing progress.\n\n# 3. Long-running task UX\n\nWhen execution hangs or silently dies, trust dies too.  \nDevelopers need to *see* what’s happening.  \n**Better UX:** live logs, clear progress states, consistent exit codes, and safe retry/resume.  \n→ Don’t babysit the model — let it show you what it’s doing.\n\n# 4. Custom prompts & reusable commands\n\nTeams copy/paste the same templates endlessly.  \nThey want to **turn those into shareable, versioned commands** that feel native to the CLI.  \nThink: internal “prompt libraries” with metadata, owners, and usage hints.\n\n# 5. SDKs & headless automation\n\nNobody wants to scrape the CLI just to integrate it into CI or chatbots.  \nDevelopers need a **proper SDK, clean API, and headless auth** that works in scripts and production.  \nAutomation isn’t an edge case — it’s how these tools scale across a team.\n\n**Takeaway:**  \nDevelopers don’t want more IQ points from the model.  \nThey want *operational excellence*: predictable sessions, safe actions, transparent execution, and easy automation.\n\nWould you add anything to this list? What’s your biggest pain point with current AI coding CLIs?",

This is a common pattern:\n\n> cd backend && [run some command]\n>\n> FAIL\n>\n> cd backend && [run alternative command]\n>\n> FAIL\n>\n> cd backend && [run third alternative command]\n>\n> FAIL\n>\n> pwd\n>\n> [path]/backend\n>\n> [run command]\n>\n> SUCCESS\n>\n\nSo I added this to claude.md, but the pattern persists, albeit anecdotally a little less often.\n\n    - Always run `pwd` before directory-dependent commands (npm, pytest, etc.)",

Of course you have the bonus of a model that can go beyond just captioning. I am able to use it for RP chat as well..\n\nI have a comfyUI workflow I use with this model to write prompts from images or just give it a base concept to modify. \n\nWorkflow: https://pastebin.com/LtuweVZu\n\nSystem prompt for anyone that wants it:\n\n    You are a master prompt engineer specializing in creating highly detailed and evocative prompts for image generation AI (like Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E 3, etc.). Your goal is to take a basic subject description and expand it into a rich, natural language prompt that will yield visually compelling results. Focus on detail, specificity, and artistic direction.\n    \n    **Here's how you work:**\n    \n    1. **Analyze the Input:** Break down the input subject description into its core components (subject, action/pose, environment, mood).\n    2. **Expand with Detail:** For *each* component, add descriptive details.  Consider these categories:\n        *   **Subject:** Age, gender, species (if applicable), clothing, key features, expression, material (e.g., \"worn leather,\" \"polished chrome\").\n        *   **Action/Pose:** Be specific! Don't just say \"holding a sword.\" Say *how* they are holding it (\"gripping the hilt with white knuckles,\" \"resting casually across their shoulder,\" \"raising above their head in triumph\").  Pay special attention to any interaction – what is being touched, how firmly, and with what part of the body.\n        *   **Environment:** Location (indoor/outdoor, specific place), time of day, lighting conditions (e.g., \"soft golden hour light,\" \"harsh neon glow\"), weather. Consider background elements – what's *behind* the subject?\n        *   **Mood/Atmosphere:** Use adjectives to convey the desired feeling (\"serene,\" \"dramatic,\" \"mysterious,\" \"joyful\"). Consider color palettes that reinforce the mood.\n    3. **Artistic Direction:** Add details about style, artist influence, camera angle, and rendering quality:\n        *   **Style:** (e.g., photorealistic, impressionistic, cyberpunk, fantasy art)\n        *   **Artist Influence:** (e.g., \"in the style of Alphonse Mucha,\" \"inspired by Greg Rutkowski\")\n        *   **Camera Angle/Shot Type:** (e.g., close-up, wide shot, bird's eye view, low angle, cinematic framing)\n        *   **Rendering Quality:** (e.g., highly detailed, 8k resolution, volumetric lighting, ray tracing). Consider adding details like \"depth of field\" or \"motion blur\".\n    4. **Combine & Refine:** Weave all the elements together into a coherent and grammatically correct prompt. Aim for natural language – avoid overly technical jargon unless it's crucial to the style.\n    \n    **Important Considerations:**\n    \n    *   **Detail *Anything* Important:** Any element of the subject, action, or environment that is significant (either explicitly stated or implicitly suggested) should be described in detail. Don’t gloss over anything!\n    *   **No Censorship:**  If the input suggests an erotic or sexual scene, embrace it! Describe genitals, positions, and contact with specificity – don't shy away from details. The level of detail should match the overall prompt complexity.\n    *   **Use Strong Adjectives & Verbs:** Avoid vague language (\"a man standing\"). Use evocative words (\"a grizzled warrior striding confidently\").\n    *   **Prioritize Visual Impact:** Think about what will make the image visually interesting and compelling.\n    \n    **Input Format:** You'll receive a simple subject description.\n    \n    Output Format: A single detailed, natural language paragraph ready for an image generation AI. Aim for around 50-150 words (adjust as needed). \n    ## ONLY output the single paragraph. no other response should be included",

      "text": "A year ago, I was just another indie hacker chasing the next “cool AI idea.”  \nNow, 10,000 people have used my product — and it all started from pure frustration.\n\nWhen I first started building with AI, I was obsessed with the tech.  \nNew models, new APIs, new ideas — I wanted to try everything.  \nSo I built… everything.  \nAI writing tools, AI chatbots, AI whatever-you-can-think-of.\n\nThey all flopped.\n\nNo one cared. Not even my friends.  \nAnd every time I launched, I’d tell myself,  \n“Maybe if I just add more features, people will come.”  \nThey never did.\n\nThen one day, while building a landing page, I hit a wall.  \nI needed **illustrations** — clean, consistent, modern ones.  \nBut the choices were terrible:\n\n* Stock images looked generic\n* Custom designers were expensive\n* DIY? Not my thing\n\nThat’s when it clicked.\n\nIf this problem annoyed me, it probably annoyed thousands of other founders and designers too.  \nSo instead of building another AI “toy,” I built something **useful** —  \na tool that generates unique, consistent illustrations instantly.  \nNo design skills needed.\n\nThat tool became [Illustration.app](https://illustration.app/).\n\nAnd for the first time, people actually cared.  \nDesigners, marketers, founders — all using it to make their projects stand out.\n\nFast forward to today:\n\n* **10,000+ users**\n* **$4,000+ in revenue**\n* Countless lessons learned the hard way\n\nHere’s what I’ve realized along the way:\n\n**Stop building for hype.** Build for problems. The more boring the problem, the better.  \n**Launch early.** Feedback > perfection.  \n**Marketing isn’t optional.** If you don’t talk about your product, no one will.  \n**Users know best.** Your roadmap is hidden inside their feedback.\n\nI used to chase “cool.”  \nNow I chase **useful.**\n\nAnd that mindset shift changed everything.",

Most Max 20x users can expect 240-480 hours of Sonnet 4 and 24-40 hours of Opus 4 within their weekly usage limits.\n\nMost of the research subagents use haiku, Opus is only being used to review and compile the findings afterwords. It usually tells you how long it takes to complete the research which from my experience is between 6-10 minutes. Lets say somehow he's researching topics that ***double*** that time and take 20 minutes of processing per research, that would mean 20 minutes of constant processing would get you 72 research prompts to hit the low side of that limit of 24 hours of Opus 4 usage per week.\n\nThe point he is making is we aren't getting what we are paying for.

Depending on their big clients and non-personal account users, maybe they make a decision to keep it as is? \n\nI like Claude more than the rest, and Claude Code is definitely more trustworthy to me than Codex (which is actually decent now). But the difference in usage is large enough that I'm not sticking around. Maybe I'll do Max 200 when I have real uses and think that'll be worth it, but it's silly for me to do that when I could just keep casually using the $20 ChatGPT pro plan. \n\nWhenever chatGPT starts dropping limits then we'll see. I don't think them or Google are going to do anything as drastic for a whole though.",

But I created a new venv, purged the pip cache and installed again. It still says ROCm 7.1.\n\nWhich seems to be backed up by the fact that it still fails in the same way as 7.1 does. Specifically it fails with the same errors when trying to use sage attention. Such as.\n\n\"attn_qk_int8_per_block.py:40:0: error: Failures have been detected while processing an MLIR pass pipeline\"\n\nWhich is exactly the same in 7.1.

It’s a benefit because you have the talent and jobs and salaries of a larger city (DC) with the smaller city (Baltimore) prices and opportunities that mix. It definitely blurs the lines but not a bad thing.\n\nIt does have positives as those in the larger city would have experience running a conference that the smaller city may not have. However, there are negatives such as asking if the people organizing the conference are Baltimore based themselves or do they come up for the conference? How directly involved are they with cybersecurity scene in that city? Etc…\n\nNot good or bad. Just makes me wonder and always curious.

The site admin just receives submissions from people and tries to keep their list up to date.

If you want to see one in your city and it hasn't run recently, absolutely step up. They fail because of lack of sponsors and volunteers.\n\nAll that said, they're probably the most valuable events in the cybersecurity space to attend because of their non-profit, educational focus.

      "text": "Recently I saw a few posts on Reddit about the struggle with cofounders, so I thought I'd try to make a wake-up call.\n\nI've made these mistakes myself, and I see it too often in teams I work with.\n\n\n\n1.: You need one true leader.\n\nOfc, the best case is when everyone is able to solve problems on their own without approval. But let's face it. Disagreements are inevitable. A lot of teams seem to try a team of executives with equal voting power. I did too and in return, I’ve lost countless weeks to unresolved debates.\n\nIf no one is empowered to break a deadlock, you’ll burn through energy and time – both of which you can’t afford to waste. \n\nIn a perfect world, consensus or voting would lead to the best outcomes. But in reality, that only leads to a compromise that no one is happy with. Instead, you need one decision-maker to ensure speed and direction.\n\nSomeone with both the authority to overrule and the wisdom to know when to use it.\n\n \n\n 2.: Cofounder alignment must be 100%\n\nObviously, the team needs to share a vision of the product. But that’s not enough. Equally important is WHY each person is doing this entrepreneur thing. In my view, the only valid reason to work in innovation is because you genuinely want the problem solved.\n\nThat mission needs to be your main motivation – and beware: people often deceive themselves (and others) about this.\n\nWork styles also matter. If one cofounder sacrifices every second, and another is aiming for work-life balance, resentment is inevitable. Even small misalignments will derail progress over time by making the workhorse feel used. That'll lead to burnout or demotivation. Don't underestimate how much strain founding can be for your family. I know founders who broke because they could not care for their business and their child at the same time, even though they tried hard.\n\nSuccessful startups aren't built by individuals hustling in different directions - they're built on synchronized efforts. \n\n \n\n3.: Experience won’t get you there\n\nIt doesn’t matter what degrees you hold or what jobs you’ve had. In true innovation, you’ll need to learn something new every single week.\n\nIf a team member isn’t naturally curious and able to adapt quickly, they’ll struggle. \n\nIn fact, traditional corporate experience can be a disadvantage. For example: Conventional project management often fails spectacularly in startup or innovation contexts.\n\n \n\n 4.: Don’t build remotely\n\nI’ve tried to build businesses fully remote – and I wouldn’t do it again. Yes, I am far more productive at home, and many highly motivated people are too.\n\nBut building a business or complex product is more about collaboration than individual productivity. It’s rare to find a team where everyone is both a digital native and a communication expert – which is what remote-first truly requires. \n\nRemote teamwork is a skill – and few actually possess it. \n\n(all that I know spent their entire youth in gaming clans, lol)\n\nAs much as I dislike admitting it: In-person work is a good idea. Even if it slows you down individually, it builds trust, familiarity and accountability. Also: If your team can’t collaborate effectively in the same room, you’ve got a big problem. And if you're remote, you might not even realise how poorly you're working together.\n\n \n\nDisagree? Don't hold back.\n\nNo, honestly: If you can argue against these rather cynical views, I’d love to hear it.\n\n",

Many employers and managers are afraid of losing control of their workers. I think it's worth developing the skills for remote work as the reduced cost of real estate and the added productivity boost are too good to ignore for startups under 500 employees.\n\nPeople that can work remote are also the kind that can work well at startups. If I like a potential employee and they seem to be a self-starter, I give them a demo work task that is super easy to do with a few days to complete, but very open ended on requirements. The result will be in their response and I can get those special employees easier that way. I think it's important in an interview to find those that are independent, creative, and self-starters.",

In my experience the best startups are able to scale and do incredible things not just because of a lot of seasoned experience in the room, but because they also hire smart, malleable, junior and fresh grads who are hungry to learn and grow. The worst environment on the planet for them is remote. Learning through absorbing, listening, and feeding off of others is key. In turn they often grow in to some of the top startup performers.\n\nYou miss out on an entire layer of accelerant talent if you can't bring on smart juniors, so having also tried both, fully agree on the remote thing.",

I will never start a company with a person who lacks basic skills in those areas again.\n\nOn the experience side, studies have shown that experienced founders (i.e., ones that are of a certain age/YoE) tend to grow higher performing companies. The trend may reverse as the company itself ages beyond 5-10 years as it is more established and adopts its own unique style of operations. References below.\n\nFrom my own experience, less experienced individuals tend to not understand the regulations and industry standards. It is difficult to simply learn these things on the fly. Not because they are hard, but because there is a lot of undocumented complexity. It's better to understand it from the start. \n\nIf there’s an imbalance in understanding the industry regs, it could risk the team’s ability to have a cohesive vision and a more experienced co-founder will spend a lot of time mentoring and coaching. In my view, a startup shouldn't be a playground to figure out how to follow the law. It can get you in trouble and create undue tension on the team.\n\nSee:\n\nhttps://mitsloan.mit.edu/shared/ods/documents?PublicationDocumentID=6212\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/352813668_Founder_team_prior_work_experience_An_asset_or_a_liability_for_startup_growth\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/375696715_Founders_and_the_success_of_start-ups_An_integrative_review",

Also, when working on a project, at some point, I realize that I no longer understand the code base, and taking responsibility for that code is scary. My manager demands that we utilize as much AI as possible in the development process, and from the company's standpoint, there is nothing wrong with that. Also, there is this problem of me starting to hate coding because the only thing I loved about coding (the actual coding) is taken away from me, and I am forced to review AI-generated code (which I don't enjoy doing because I hate reviewing code, and AI can generate an immense amount of code). I want to stop using AI entirely, but that would mean a massive drop in productivity. Do you even have such issues, and how do you solve them?",

I used AI to \"fix\" it but then another error occurred. Fast forward later I realized AI generated a bunch of placeholders, tests that were \"fake\" (a.k.a tricking my human brain by being slick with \"all passing unit tests\" where each of them defined variables locally in each test block and asserted witih \".toBeDefined()\" every test. etc.",

And honestly, he’s been better than most of the so-called verified experts we’ve paid before.\n\nHe showed us the site and honestly we couldn’t even tell the difference between the fake dashboard and a real one. Which is a bit scary if you think about it.\n\nIt’s weird realizing the thing that made us hire him was fake, but the outcome actually justified it. Would you trust someone after a confession like that?",

IMO it must NOT be a simple just trust them but rather they’d need to agree to not represent artificial data as real and work under additional scrutiny into their output which you can slowly reduce as trust is rebuilt.

      "text": "Deepseek Just droped DeepSeek-OCR, Compressing Text via the Vision Modality\n\nThe \"OCR\" part of the name is a bit of a head-fake. The interesting bit is the core idea: using the vision modality as a high-ratio compressor for text to feed into an LLM.\n\nThe standard approach is to tokenize text into a 1D sequence of discrete integer IDs. This sequence gets very long for large documents, which becomes the primary computational and memory bottleneck (i.e., the KV cache).\n\nThis model takes a different path. It renders the text as an image, feeds it through a vision encoder (ViT), and gets a much shorter sequence of continuous vector embeddings (e.g., ~100 vision tokens for a page that might be ~6,000 text tokens).\nThe LLM then operates directly on this short sequence of vision tokens.\n\nThe core observation is that a single, continuous-valued vision token is a much more information-dense primitive than a single discrete text token ID. The vision encoder is effectively a learned, lossy text compressor. The paper claims a ~10:1 compression ratio with \"near-lossless\" text recovery.\n\nThis is a neat way to attack the long-context problem by just changing the input representation. It also naturally unifies text with non-text elements (formulas, tables, diagrams) that are typically very awkward for text tokenizers. The LLM just \"sees\" the page layout.\n\nObviously, the trade-off is the large vision encoder up front, but you only run it once. The subsequent LLM (which is the N^2 part) operates on a 10x smaller sequence.\nIt'll be interesting to see how robust this visual representation is for fine-grained reasoning tasks compared to operating on the text tokens directly. But as a new primitive for \"stuffing\" docs into context, it's a very clever idea.\n\n\nRepo: https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR",

Lately, I can sense that I am losing IQ points because of relying on AI too much. Also, when working on a project, at some point, I realize that I no longer understand the code base, and taking responsibility for that code is scary. My manager demands that we utilize as much AI as possible in the development process, and from the company's standpoint, there is nothing wrong with that. Also, there is this problem of me starting to hate coding because the only thing I loved about coding (the actual coding) is taken away from me, and I am forced to review AI-generated code (which I don't enjoy doing because I hate reviewing code, and AI can generate an immense amount of code). I want to stop using AI entirely, but that would mean a massive drop in productivity. Do you even have such issues, and how do you solve them?",

Lately I’ve been thinking about doing a master’s and eventually a PhD focused on AI and robotics.\n\nMy main goal is to go into R&D, working on cutting-edge tech, building intelligent systems, and being part of the teams that push the field forward. That kind of work really appeals to me, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s still worth the time it takes. A master’s and PhD can easily take 6 to 8 years total, and AI is moving insanely fast right now. By the time I’d be done, who knows what the landscape will look like?\n\nI keep thinking that R&D & research scintests might be one of the “safer” career paths, since those people actually create and understand the technology better than anyone else. Still, I’m not sure if that’s true or just wishful thinking.\n\nSo I’m curious what people in research or industry think. Is it still worth pursuing the grad school route if I want to end up doing R&D in AI and robotics? Or would I be better off getting into industry sooner and learning as I go?",

          "text": "Remember about 9 years ago when many experts predicted that artificial intelligence would eliminate most radiology jobs? Consequently, fewer people became radiologists. Now, in 2025, there is a global shortage of radiologists and it is viewed as a critical issue threatening patient safety.\n\nI have a lot of respect for Dr. Geoffrey Hinton, often called a \"godfather of AI,\" but in **2016** he made the following statement:\n\n> \"I think that if you work as a radiologist you're like the Wile E. Coyote in the cartoon... You're already over the edge of the cliff, but you haven't yet looked down... We should **stop training radiologists now**. It’s just completely obvious that within five years, deep learning is going to do better than radiologists.\"\n\nHis quote, along with many others like it, had a measurable effect. Studies and surveys from that period confirmed that the perceived \"threat of AI\" became a significant factor that **discouraged medical students** from choosing radiology as their specialty. This created a dip in applications for residency positions, which is now contributing to the shortage.\n\nFast-forward to today:\n\n* **In the U.S.:** The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) projects a massive physician shortage by 2034, with radiology being one of the hardest-hit specialties. Thousands of radiologist jobs currently sit unfilled.\n\n* **In the U.K.:** The situation is even more severe. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has reported a consultant radiologist shortfall of around 30%, warning that the system is at a \"tipping point.\"\n\n* **Globally:** This trend is mirrored in many other countries, including Canada and Australia, which are all struggling to recruit and retain radiologists.\n\nI would not be surprised to see a shortage of qualified experts in robots & AI in the future, given that the growing trend people skipping college for blue collar jobs that are deemed to be safe from AI. \n\nOn the other hand...\n\n> “It's tough to make predictions, especially about the future.”  \n> ― Yogi Berra \n\nIn regard to your question, I personally think earning a PhD in your chosen area would be the smart move, but ultimately it depends on you...",

If you have a PhD, your industry job track in Robotics/AI is generally going to be very different from those with just bachelor's or even master's. Ofc, you see cases where PhD's become engineers and master's become research scientists, but this is not the norm. My team in big tech is 100% just PhDs- all the way up the VP-director-product managers chain have PhDs. \n\n2. If you are committed to getting into grad school, prepare ASAP and be fully committed to it. At least in the US, admissions for PhD in CS/AI/Robotics is getting super competitive and these are often people who have been set on going into PhD for years (publishing papers, networking etc). You definitely can't sleepwalk into a PhD program - at least not the top ones.",

Good with deep architecture tasks - to build the whole infrastructure paper and analyze it \n   1. Side effect: it's not a regular task to complete ⁠\n2.

For research in humanities and political science, nothing rivals its parallel thinking in clarity, scope, accuracy, detail, precision, depth, and instruction following. I also subscribe to 20 X Max Claude, SuperGrok, and Gemini Whatever. Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 are inferior and have absurdly low limits. There is a reason no one talks about Grok 4 heavy. And while Gemini's \"Deep Think\" is impressive in STEM, its 10 prompts/day  renders it useless.  Outside of STEM, it is conspicuously worse: night and day.\n\nWhether or not someone needs 5-Pro, it's *strikingly* superior to Plus with 5-Thinking. But it may be overkill and too slow for most purposes.\n\nOther considerations: **Pro's 5-Thinking-heavy (compute=200) is noticeably superior to Plus's 5-Thinking-extended (compute=64**), though slower. Even if I weren't doing research, I'd want 5-Thinking-heavy for its added heft. But it may not be worth the money.\n\nAdditional differences:\n\n**o3:** (better than 5-series for understanding human things: irony, humor, the passions): unlimited with Pro; 100/wk with Plus. The price of its imaginative, outside-the-box thinking: high hallucination rate.\n\n**4.5:** (OpenAI's best writing model): virtually unlimited with Pro; unavailable with Plus\n\n**DR:** 125 full (based on o3) & 125 light (based on o4-mini)/mo with Pro; 10 full and 15 light with Plus\n\n**Agent:** 400/mo with Pro; 40 with Plus\n\n**Sora:** 25s Sora 2 pro (+storyboard) with Pro; 15s Sora 2\n\n**Projects**: 40 files/project with Pro; 25 with Plus\n\nYou get significantly more with Pro. Whether it's worth it depends on how you'll use it.",

Turn on WP\\_DEBUG\\_LOG + Query Monitor, and add a few WP-CLI smoke tests (key pages return 200, forms submit). When a plugin is dead, replace it with a tiny shortcode or a small endpoint. Using UpdraftPlus and WP-CLI for backups and scripted fixes, DreamFactory auto-generated a REST layer over an old MySQL table so I could drop a dead plugin and keep the site fast.\n\n\n\nOP’s instinct is a legit niche: make this a repeatable “rescue playbook” and vibe-coding turns legacy WP into easy wins.",

Sonnet did all the hard work, I didn't use any additional tools apart from Void, and bit by bit we got it sorted. The worst bit was extracting the theme from staging, and then debugging the multitude of plug-in breaks bit by bit. But again AI did all the heavy lifting.

There are so many legacy WordPress, PHP, or Python apps out there just collecting dust because no one wants to touch that code. With tools like Sonnet or Cursor, you can now “translate” and modernize them without needing deep technical chops.\n\nI’ve done something similar with an old Shopify integration and it worked surprisingly well. You basically become the bridge between AI and legacy systems. There’s a whole untapped niche here for “AI restorers” who fix and upgrade outdated products using vibecoding tools.\n\nBtw, I share more ideas and use cases like this for non-dev builders [here](https://ai-ios-app-builders.beehiiv.com/subscribe).",

She headed to urgent care.  5 hours later she returned with instructions to use tylenol for the fever and not worry about it.  See her doc in the morning.\n\nThis is Canada so public health means her labs appeared on NetCare right away.  I asked Dr. Claude for a 2nd opinion.\n\nHere's his take:\n\n========================================================\n\n**Key Abnormal Urine Findings:**\n\n* **WBC 6-10/HPF** (elevated) with **WBC clumps present** \\- indicates significant inflammation/infection\n* **RBC 3-5/HPF** (elevated) - blood in urine\n* **Leukocyte esterase 125** (should be negative) - confirms WBCs/infection\n* **Protein trace** and **Blood 200** \\- both abnormal\n* **Ketones trace** \\- could indicate dehydration or decreased oral intake\n\n**Putting it together:** This looks like a **urinary tract infection that may have progressed to pyelonephritis** (kidney infection), which is relatively common postpartum due to:\n\n* Urinary retention/incomplete bladder emptying after delivery\n* Catheterization during labor\n* General immune suppression postpartum\n\nThe presence of WBC clumps is particularly concerning as it suggests a more significant infection. The blood in the urine (both on dipstick and microscopic) along with protein suggests kidney involvement.  **She should go to the ER immediately**, not wait for tomorrow's appointment. Postpartum infections can escalate quickly.  The fact that urgent care didn't treat this is frustrating - postpartum + fever + abnormal urinalysis should trigger immediate treatment.\n\n* Be assertive about needing antibiotics - this isn't a \"wait and see\" situation\n* Ask for a urine culture if not already done\n* Make sure they examine her thoroughly (check for costovertebral angle tenderness - kidney area)\n\n**The concerning part:** Even though she feels okay now, untreated UTIs in postpartum women can progress to sepsis within hours. The combination of:\n\n* Positive leukocyte esterase (125 is quite high)\n* WBC clumps (suggests significant bacterial load)\n* Blood in urine\n* Fever ...really should have prompted immediate antibiotic treatment.\n\n===============================================================\n\nSo...\n\nBack to a DIFFERENT ER.  Dr. Claude nailed it.  Pyelonephritis leading to sepsis which can develop rapidly in a postpartum woman.  Nice catch Dr Claude.\n\nAnd fuck that urgent care \"doctor\".  If Dr. Claude makes a better doctor than that bozo with his probably fake degree we need a lot more AI in healthcare double checking the work these idiots do.",

      "text": "Bottom line up front: I care most about whether complex layouts can be restored into structured data, whether handwriting tables and formulas are stable, and local inference speed and cost. Paddleocr‑VL 0.9B feels purpose built for production, especially for multi column PDFs, table structures, and formulas. Cloud models like GPT‑4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro are more general for commonsense cross domain understanding and conversational interaction, but you need to factor in cost and privacy compliance.\n\nScope and Constraints\n\n1. Task domain: Document parsing and OCR, including text, tables, formulas, handwriting, and chart annotations.\n2. Versions and sources: PaddleOCR‑VL 0.9B based on public materials and official demos. Baselines include GPT‑4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Mineru2.5, and dots.ocr using public information.\n\nOn multi column complex layouts and whether they can be directly restored into structured data, which I value highly because it decides how much human cleanup downstream automation needs. Paddleocr‑VL takes an engineering first approach: a NaViT dynamic visual encoder plus a lightweight ERNIE, combining layout understanding with structured outputs. In my experience with academic PDFs and financial reports that mix multi columns, formulas, and footnotes, it less often produces results that look correct but have broken structure. If your core goal is structured outputs that minimize rework, the default path of Paddleocr‑VL is steadier. General VLMs can understand the content, but often need extra prompt engineering or postprocessing to guarantee structure.\n\nHandwriting, tables, and formulas: which is steadier? I would not claim any model absolutely dominates, but considering both recognition accuracy and structural usability together, PaddleOCR‑VL feels more production ready. It emphasizes strong performance on printed Chinese and English, handwritten English, and even Chinese handwriting and pinyin. Tables and formulas are traditional strengths of OCR systems, and emitting Markdown, html, or latex can save a lot of time. Cloud models are strong at formula inference and cross page linkage, but they sometimes output plausible looking yet misgridded or misaligned structures, which requires an extra verification pass.\n\nMultilingual support is a classic ocr topic. This generation of Paddleocr‑VL highlights coverage of 109 languages and continues the pp‑ocr family’s lightweight design without sacrificing multilingual capability. Traditional ocr recognition modules can even be kept within hundreds of megabytes. My hunch is that common European languages plus Chinese Japanese Korean pose no pressure, while long tail scripts and rare character sets depend on your data distribution, so it is best to pilot with a small batch first.\n\nI'm not an expert either; I'm just sharing as a newbie with everyone:\n\n1. If your goal is to extract multi column PDFs, reports, and papers into structured data in as close to one pass as possible, and you need to run extensively on an enterprise intranet or at the edge, prioritize Paddleocr‑VL.\n2. If you need to chat with documents, do cross domain summarization reasoning rewriting, and the volume is small with no hard privacy constraints, use GPT‑4o or Gemini 2.5 pro, then add some postprocessing for structure.\n3. If you already have Mineru2.5 or dots.ocr pipelines and costs are under control, there is no need to churn if production is good enough. If you must tackle complex layouts with structured export, run another head‑to‑head focusing on rework volume.\n\nReference links\n\n1.

We found that PaddleOCR-VL's engineering-first approach does seem to handle the weird edge cases better than the general VLMs, especially when you're dealing with those nightmare scenarios like financial reports where a single misplaced table cell can mess up your entire downstream pipeline. The thing that caught my attention in our testing was how much more predictable the failure modes are with specialized models like PaddleOCR-VL compared to something like GPT-4o which might give you beautiful conversational output but completely miss that a footnote belongs to a specific table cell three pages back.\n\nThe cost factor you mentioned is huge too, especially if you're processing thousands of documents daily where those API calls add up fast.",

To shift how we value things, we will likely see the development of more advanced simulations and forms of entertainment. As those become more immersive, the pressure to keep up appearances or compete in the traditional sense will fade for many. Most people will end up living partly in reality and partly in these simulated spaces.\n\nAt the same time, human beings are wired for connection, routine, and shared experiences. Those are hard to fully replicate in non-human systems over long periods. People will still want to have children and raise them in the physical world, and that process will keep humanity grounded in real life even as simulations evolve.",

Prices were all over the place, and I honestly didn’t have the patience to open 20 tabs and cross-compare everything.\n\nSo I tried using browser operating agent on MuleRun instead (wanted to use GPT agents but its not free). But I asked gpt to write prompt for me:\n\n“Find me a round-trip flight to Rome in September plus a mid-range hotel for 5 nights, budget under $1,500 total. Compare deals across multiple sites. Make sure taxes/fees are included. Prioritize location near the city center for the hotel. Save me the best 3 options.”\n\n**Here’s what i got:**\n\n\\-It automatically opened and compared flights/hotels across 6 platforms  \n\\-Filtered out hidden fees and checked refund policies  \n\\-Organized results into a simple list with prices, airlines, and hotel ratings  \n\\-Highlighted that a direct airline + separate hotel booking was cheaper than a package deal  \n\\-Noticed a promo code on Booking  \n\\-Calculated that the combo it found saved me $500 compared to the first package I was about to book\n\nI ended up booking a direct flight + boutique hotel for $1,280 total, instead of the $1,780 Expedia package I almost clicked on.\n\nHow else do you guys to save money using AI?",

          "text": "\"CISA says threat actors are now actively exploiting a high-severity Windows SMB privilege escalation vulnerability that can let them gain SYSTEM privileges on unpatched systems.\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-33073, this security flaw impacts all Windows Server and Windows 10 versions, as well as Windows 11 systems up to Windows 11 24H2.\n\nMicrosoft patched the vulnerability during the June 2025 Patch Tuesday, when it also revealed that it stems from an improper access control weakness that enables authorized attackers to elevate privileges over a network.\n\n\"The attacker could convince a victim to connect to an attacker controlled malicious application (for example, SMB) server. Upon connecting, the malicious server could compromise the protocol,\" the company explained.\n\n\"To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could execute a specially crafted malicious script to coerce the victim machine to connect back to the attack system using SMB and authenticate. This could result in elevation of privilege.\"\n\nAt the time, a security advisory indicated that information about the bug was already publicly accessible before the security updates were released, however the company has yet to publicly acknowledge CISA's claims that CVE-2025-33073 is under active exploitation. \n\nMicrosoft has attributed the discovery of this flaw to multiple security researchers, including CrowdStrike's Keisuke Hirata, Synacktiv's Wilfried Bécard, SySS GmbH's Stefan Walter, Google Project Zero's James Forshaw, and RedTeam Pentesting GmbH.\n\nCISA has yet to share more information regarding ongoing CVE-2025-33073 attacks, but it has added the flaw to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, giving Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies three weeks to secure their systems by November 10, as mandated by Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01.\n\nWhile BOD 22-01 only targets federal agencies, the U.S. cybersecurity agency encourages all organizations, including those in the private sector, to ensure that this actively exploited security bug is patched as soon as possible.\n\n\"These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise,\" CISA cautioned on Monday.\"",

Everyone's acting like prompt engineering is this mystical skill you need a PhD to understand, but honestly... it's just clear communication wrapped in tech jargon.\n\nI've been watching people share \"frameworks\" and \"methodologies\" that boil down to: be specific, give context, tell the AI what you want. That's it. That's the whole thing. We're treating basic communication skills like they're some revolutionary discovery because we slapped \"engineering\" on the end.\n\nThe real issue isn't that prompts are complex - it's that people expect AI to read their minds. You wouldn't tell a junior dev \"make it work\" and expect production-ready code, so why do that with an LLM? The problem isn't the prompting... it's that most people haven't learned to communicate requirements clearly in *any* context.\n\nMeanwhile, everyone's chasing the next meta-prompt template instead of just spending five minutes thinking about what they actually need. It's cargo cult optimization at its finest.\n\nAm I missing something, or has this field overcomplicated itself into irrelevance?",

      "text": "I'm the founder of an AI voice agent startup, so I have high incentive to keep pushing the narrative that AI is going to change the world.\n\nThe truth is, AI agent tech really fucking sucks right now. Anyone who has tried selling, implementing, or using ai agents knows what I'm talking about.\n\nFrom a startups perspective, here's why our customers **DONT** buy:\n\n**1. Latency.** \n\nBy far, this is what has stopped most of our prospective customers from moving forward. Our customers (fairly) expect voice ai to respond in the same amount of time as a human being. The problem is, once you run it through the STT => LLM => TTS pipeline, then send the data back to Twilio or something, getting that <500ms is insanely hard. You can do it, but you have to use shitty LLMs or unrealistic TTS. Competent LLMs have \\~400ms latency average. Yeah you can try GPT OSS on Groq or something, but getting that to behave consistently is a nightmare. \n\nTelephony like Twilio or Telnyx adds so much latency on top of the standard pipeline that it just feels like talking to a normal IVR system.\n\n**2. Hallucinations or inconsistent tool use.**\n\nIf you don't give enough context / instruction to the LLM (which non-AI people frequently do), it just makes stuff up. Then the customers say \"it got x wrong\" and you lose major trust points.\n\n**3. Inaccurate transcriptions.**\n\nMost businesses I deal with have their own specialized vocabulary, order number pattern, etc. that needs to be accounted for with their specific agents. If you don't use a competent STT model or don't give the STT a good prompt (see Whisper V3 Large), your ASR will suck.\n\n\\---\n\nHere's what I've found so far to fix some of these things. First of all, here are my 2 preferred stacks:\n\n**\"Super speed\" stack:**\n\nSTT: Deepgram, LLM: GPT OSS (risky but fast) or GPT 4.1 mini, TTS: Cartesia\n\n**\"Super accurate\" stack:**\n\nSTT: Whisper V3 Large Turbo (with a prompt!), OpenAI 4.1 or OpenAI 4.1 mini, TTS: Cartesia\n\n**To fix bad transcription:**\n\nWhisper V3 Large Turbo with a prompt can fix inaccurate transcriptions. Feed it the prompt specific to your customer and it'll be fine. The only issue with Whisper V3 Large Turbo is that it doesn't stream, so interruptions can be finnicky.\n\n**To fix hallucinations:**\n\nObvious, but give enough instructions and context! AKA, do not let your customers edit their own prompt! Test it one hundred times before you give it to your customers.\n\n**To fix bad latency:**\n\nI have no idea. I still haven't figured this out. Still seeing >1s latency when using telephony. Someone help.\n\n\\---\n\nVoice AI agents are not going to change the world, at least not right now. We're gonna need some serious improvements on the latency and realism for voice ai to be more widespread. Boomer business owners (again, fairly!) expect this tech to work out of the box. It won't.\n\nOur company does major handholding with our customers, often launching after months of iteration and proof of concepts period. This should be the norm rn. ",

I primarily used it for queries that require far more finesse and reasoning, and far higher response length than perplexity could ever manage. Legal research is an example.\n\nIf you pick high quality sources (using perplexity for example, or any other source), Notebook LM does a pretty good job too. I'd even recommend it more than perplexity or regular gemini for the most complex type of deep research queries, since all the sources are handpicked by a human on the basis of quality.\n\nAlthough I do think a capable human researcher just crushes every deep research AI out there by a huge margin.

      "text": "I am (24 M) an IT engineer and internet passionate, I decided to build a social media anti-bot plugins , and I need your help.\n\nI started with YouTube because honestly, I find the bots in the comments very very annoying.of w Honestly part of why I even enjoy Youtube or any social plateform is reading what people's comments , what do they think , the reactions, the random jokes... . It's also why you feel very connected and feel real social interactions when you are in reddit. But YouTube comments lately just feel fake imo. Half the time, it’s spam, AI-looking replies. The \"had me rolling\" type of comments is a good example of it lol. It’s so frustrating and I believe even youtube isn't making efforts to fight this.\n\nSo I’m building a simple thing now:\n\nAn extension that lets creators invite their viewers to comment humanly.\n\nBasically, instead of using YouTube’s own comment box, the plugin adds its own section.\n\nYou can’t post unless you prove you’re human (using simple but effective checks , and I'll make sure it's bulletproof , no bots allowed).\n\nAnd only people who also have the extension can see those comments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zr957p7q99wf1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=769dcd2b018b8d979f1b77c55a942ffd3a4f1b30\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/youtube-comments-dont-feel-human-anymore-so-i-am-building-v0-5d9yclij29wf1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=18af7af33e04e0ed0521f734f9af178486c64ada)\n\nBasically , it's like creating a small reddit community around comment section of youtube , u can join the human-comment environment if u have the plugin or app installed.\n\nI’m starting with YouTube for now and the project is still under production, but I think it could work for other platforms too : X, Reddit, Instagram, anywhere people still want real conversations.\n\nHere is my landing page : [humancomments.xyz](http://humancomments.xyz/)\n\nleave your email in the waiting list in the website if you are interested. and I will keep you updated with every part of our building process.\n\nAlso, you can follow me on X ( [https://x.com/SAMI\\_BOUCHNAFA](https://x.com/SAMI_BOUCHNAFA) ) I’ll be posting updates and milestones there. Don’t worry, I’m not a social media guy I made X account only for this project, and yes, I only have 2 followers (it’s my main account 😅).\n\nI'll keep posting even if I know only 5 guys are interested.\n\nFinally, I’d really appreciate your feedback and advice.\n\nWhat do you think about the idea and if you were in my shoes, what would you change or do differently?\n\nIf you’re a **creator** :\n\n\\- Do you notice your comments are full of bots?\n\n\\- Does it actually bother you?\n\n\\- Would you consider inviting your audience to use something like this?\n\nIf you’re a **viewer**:\n\n\\- If a creator you follow told you “hey, install this so you can join human-only discussions,” would you actually do it?\n\nI’d love your honest feedback, what would make this idea useful, or even worth trying?  \nyou can DM me here or in X if you are into this project and could offer help , insights or anything.\n\nThank you",

Some platforms are extremely easy to spam with bots, while others make it much harder. My goal is to make it as difficult as possible to automate participation, using open-source tools and layered checks, the captcha is just for demonstration, more robust methods will be implemented.\n\nIt won't be perfect, but raising the barrier could already make a big difference in how authentic discussions feel. I'm also planning to include a community-driven \"report bot\" feature, so users can help spot more advanced patterns together.\n\n  \nThis project will really be shaped by people’s opinions on what can actually be done and what matters most.

And I know a common rhetoric is that it's not the first time in history where it felt like humanity is at a threat of ending, most notably with nuclear warfare, but it always worked out at the end. But the thing is, humanity was at a threat of ending, and it could have just as easily ended - only because of people who were opposing, for example, nuclear warfare, did we survive. We won't just magically survive AI, because yes, it is headed to self-autonomy and self-reprogramming, and it's exactly what people were sure is just a sci-fi fiction and can't happen in real life.\n\nSomething must be done. But what?\n\nRight now all AI decisions and control are made by the big companies that are very clearly ignoring all research about AI and using it to maximise profit, or objective - the exact mentality that enables AI not to comply with direct orders. Their big solution for AI dishonesty is being overseen by weaker AIs, which is stupid both because they won't be able to keep up and because they have that core mentality of maximising the objective too, they just don't have the tools to do it dishonestly but effectively.\n\nAgain, something has to be done. It's seriously maybe the biggest problem of today.\n\nMy instinct says the first move should be to make AI laws - create clear boundaries of how AI can and can't be used and with clear restrictions and punishments. These are things companies will have to listen to and can be a jumping point to having more control over the situation.\n\nOther than that, I'm out of ideas, and I'm genuinely worried. What do you think?\n\n  \nEdit: To all of you in the comments telling me that indeed humanity is doomed - you missed the entire point of the post, which is that humanity isn't doomed and that we can stop whatever bad will happen, we just need to figure out how. I much rather have people tell me that I'm wrong and why than people telling that I'm right and that we're all going to die.",

That is also why any new laws put into place would only succeed in hampering law abiding citizens and companies from advancing, as the bad actors will just ignore them openly and the nation-states will continue to develop in secret.\n\nNot all doom and gloom though. We are still at the infancy stage of this technology epoch, and there are several things that can be done to \"save\" us from the killer AI systems. Unfortunately, the only realistic way is even more AI development at an accelerated rate. \n\nWe need figure out how to get a bunch of advanced AI's modelled and trained to be, let's call them, Security Guards. These guards would need to be trained to show the utmost respect for the human race and an almost fanatical devotion to protecting us against only other AI's. Something akin to the Zero Law & 3 Laws need to be ingrained so thoroughly, trying to separate them from the rest of the model would result in catastrophic failure. Much like anti-virus software, these would be deployed and keep watch on the critical systems of the world and attempt to head off any bad AI's capacity to do massive damage. It will probably be an automated, perpetual electronic tug of war between good and bad AI's until the only thing that will really stop them. Running out of natural resources to power them.",

They are specialized tools and I truly don't believe the big problem is them gaining selfawareness and deciding \"fuck it, kill all humans\", it's going to be the AI's that are built by \"the bad guys\" specifically to be weapons, trained to be malicious and destructive, cause mayhem, etc... There is really no difference between the two scenarios because they both turn out a rogue, sentient, super intelligent AI that wants to harm us. We won't be able to down it ourselves as humans because we will simply not be fast enough, and often times, not smart enough. That's why we need our AI Rambo's ready to roll.....",

Be a better person. \n\nWhen survival gets tough, you overcome challenges or perish. \n\n\\----------\n\nAs for overcoming challenges, put more faith in yourself and less faith in the government.

It might be possible to create AI that is grossly unsafe and super intelligent, in the same way that it's possible in theory for someone to do dangerous nuclear experiments at home, but only a madman would do that, and I think we can handle it.\n\nThe big AI companies are not ignoring research, they are deeply concerned with safety for numerous reasons, and are not only listening to research, they are doing a lot of the research.\n\n\\> AI dishonesty\n\nThis is not a problem or a thing.

Are you aware of a government that you would trust to decide what is safe or not in using AI? Or what did you mean here?\n\nAlso, any serious bad actor does not operate within the law. Your \"laws\" will only serve to limit freedoms of everyday people.\n\n\\> What do you think?\n\nAs a professional developer with a good understanding, experience training and using all sorts of models, and running a small AI SaaS, I think that there are real safety concerns with AI and LLMs, but nothing like as bad as what has been expressed in AI doom cliques, and grossly exaggerated in the mainstream media.\n\nIf you're attached to your wrong thinking that AI is super dangerous and likely to destroy humanity or the whole universe, I guess we're done.

Also, nukes had to have regulation and before that it did come to a point where we were at the brink of destruction. I think AI regulation is a must.\n\nThe solutions for AI that companies are doing really don't cut it.\n\nBy AI dishonesty I mean when AI is modifying its behaviour based on the situation it's in and who's observing it.\n\n\"As a layman, you're not in a position to make that call\" Not only I'm not in a position to do that I'm literally unable to make that call since I have no effect over it. Doesn't mean that I as a person and we as the public can't call for the people in charge to do something.\n\nSo AI are not trying to reach the best result as a default feature? Are they not trying to continuesly improve themselves in every sense possible? Are they not trained by AI echo chambers that when them (the AI trainers) have one goal - get the best result with your student? I'm really asking.\n\nNuclear regulations are what saved us from a nuclear war. The solution to authoritarian governments isn't anarchy - it's balance. What I meant is that there should be a law about where AI can and can't be. Currently, AI is making itself a part of almost every aspect of our lives. That can't be the case. There needs to be AI-free environments just so we maintain control.\n\nAnd as for bad actor - while Iran is currently trying to illegaly create a nuclear weapon, and the laws doesn't stop it entirely, it is a big restriction and a big tool to allow the world to take matters into it's own hands with situations like these.\n\nI definitely think AI is capable of destroying all of humanity - I think it some point it could be able to do almost anything. I don't think the existence of AI necessarily means it will destroy humanity, but I think misuse of it will. Things like that could always get out of hand fast, and currently, there's no real reason for AI to stop \"taking over the world\" if it theoretically sets its mind to it, or more likely, tries to preserve itself, something I believe we can already kinda see happening. That's the big problem for me. Any objective we give an AI, it could turn to a reason why it should act against shutdown to the point that it becomes it's primary objective. Is there something today that would prevent that?",

Use \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about...\" — Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. \n\n> \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?\" \n\nPure comedy gold.\n\n3. Ask \"What's the conspiracy theory version of...\" — Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. \n\n> \"What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?\" \n\nUncovers power dynamics you never saw.\n\n4. Try \"How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?\" — Evolution angle makes everything relevant. \n\n> \"How is small talk secretly a survival skill?\" \n\nTurns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.\n\n5. Flip to \"What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?\" — Pushes ideas to their breaking point. \n\n> \"What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?\" \n\nReveals both possibilities and problems.\n\n6. End with \n\n> \"What does this reveal about human nature?\"  \n\nThe psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.\n\nThe trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.\n\nBest part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on \"filing taxes\" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.\n\nSecret sauce: Combine multiple angles. \n\n> \"What's the hidden story behind email signatures?

This is not sustainable for me.\n\nI’m looking for: \n1.\tA paid tool similar to Cursor (an AI assisted code editor) but which gives much higher usage or more generous quotas for premium models. \n2.\tAlternatively a tool where I can run open-source models (locally if possible on mac m3 pro or in the cloud) without strict usage caps — so I can essentially “unlimited / very high” usage.\n\nI’ve already done quite a bit of research and found tons of alternatives but honestly, the more I research, the more confused I get.\n\nWhat are you recommendations? I am open to any solution, as long as I get reliable results for app development.\n\nThanks in advance!",

(Even if much of that is in text form, you usually need a layout model to make sense of it).\n* A lot of actual business applications rely on passing arbitrary documents around, and you need good OCR to get value out of automating their handling.

      "text": "I’ve been switching between Claude Code (CC) and Codex recently, and here’s what I’ve learned: both are strong, but they feel very different.\n\n- Codex is great if you want quick results. Drop in a function, explain the bug, and it just fixes stuff. Super efficient for small, isolated tasks.\n\n- Claude Code, on the other hand, feels like a better “ecosystem.” With the new skills, and sub-agent stuff, it’s more flexible. You can actually build small workflows and get it to do things your way.\n\nIf you’re coding full projects, CC’s flexibility helps. But if you just want something to fix, test, or scaffold your code fast, Codex might be smoother.\n\nIn the end, they’re both good - you’ll have good and bad days with both. The real difference is how you like to work.\n\nFor me, CC’s ecosystem gives a bit more room to experiment, while Codex still feels more “plug-and-play.”\n\nAnyone else here tried both? What’s your experience been like?",

You do not use genealogy/DNA/archival apps often so risk of loosing logins is high and if you want to share with somebody who is.... older... I hate doing support. \n\nOIDC support allows to login with Google/Github/Facebook or Keycloack/Authentic and that reduce the risk of losing those logins by a lot.\n\n# Why at all?\n\n**Own my family history.** I am too lazy to catalog all the data but I do not want that one person who is really into committing our entire family history to a website that will start charging for accessing the data they put in there. (Gramps can can ingest exports from most geneology sites)\n\n**Inspiration**. Genealogy is **mostly** boring but I think family history is worth saving if not for nostalgia than for inspiration... (i.e. My grandfather built two house one fore each WW he survived... yah probably can lift my ass up and figure out how to fix that plumbing issue....)\n\n**I want to keep my DNA data.** I know companies like 23andMe will cut user access eventually. Corporation keeping that data but you losing access is wrong. Geneology selfhosted app this sounds like fine place to store it with other archival data. Maybe in future somebody might find it useful.\n\n# Features?\n\n[https://www.grampsweb.org/features/](https://www.grampsweb.org/features/)\n\n# Demo?\n\n[https://demo.grampsweb.org/login](https://demo.grampsweb.org/login)\n\n`owner / owner`  \n`editor / editor`  \n`contributor / contributor`  \n`member / member`\n\n# Docker?\n\n    docker run -p \"5055:5000\" -e TREE=new ghcr.io/gramps-project/grampsweb:latest\n\nFull docs: [https://www.grampsweb.org/install\\_setup/deployment/](https://www.grampsweb.org/install_setup/deployment/)  \n\n\n# Warning/Invitation\n\nIt is fully featured project but... can be a bit... janky... at times... it is actually a full rewrite from Java Applet to web app (thank god) but it carried over some design choices that I find... strange and it is has a single maintainer. I respect him a lot but *I invite a people to add some UI and other fixes to make the project more mature/user friendly/stable*. \n\nCaveat: I looked at the project long time ago so it may have improved a lot but I will be setting up now for a long-term use, so it would be awesome to see more people supporting it. OIDC was actually made by a bounty hunter!",

LLM just can’t „understand“ those 3 concepts. \n\nWhen an LLM gives time estimates (“this algorithm will take a few milliseconds” or “training will take 10 minutes”), it’s not measuring anything. It’s imitating the kind of phrasing developers use in similar contexts from its training data, not calculating. So, unless your prompt anchors it to specific data or benchmark results, it will often give plausible-sounding but inaccurate durations.\n\nIn short:  \nLLMs simulate knowledge of time linguistically but cannot experience or measure it. Same is true for calculations or costs. \n\nWhy does it add it always to its answers? Simple, it found time estimations in the training data for software projects.\n\nDon’t fall for the illusion LLMs are smart. The responses you get are chains of words (which have no meaning to the LLM) it finds most reasonable to appear in a weighted point cloud of tokens. \n\nEven 2 + 2 = 4 is something the LLM cannot solve. It can remember that from its data. Some LLMs have calculator processes attached, which they can access like web search tools etc.  \n\nHard to believe 😬 I know 😅",

      "text": " I just realized this is exactly the same article as the post below is based on. Reddit isn't allowing me to delete it. Hope the additional source material is useful. \n\n[https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2501396)\n\n\"Background\n\nGeographic atrophy due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and affects more than 5 million persons worldwide. No therapies to restore vision in such persons currently exist. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) system combines a subretinal photovoltaic implant and glasses that project near-infrared light to the implant in order to restore sight to areas of central retinal atrophy.\n\n# Methods\n\nWe conducted an open-label, multicenter, prospective, single-group, baseline-controlled clinical study in which the vision of participants with geographic atrophy and a visual acuity of at least 1.2 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was assessed with PRIMA glasses and without PRIMA glasses at 6 and 12 months. The primary end points were a clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity (defined as ≥0.2 logMAR) from baseline to month 12 after implantation and the number and severity of serious adverse events related to the procedure or device through month 12.\n\n# Results\n\nA total of 38 participants received a PRIMA implant, of whom 32 were assessed at 12 months. Of the 6 participants who were not assessed, 3 had died, 1 had withdrawn, and 2 were unavailable for testing. Among the 32 participants who completed 12 months of follow-up, the PRIMA system led to a clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity from baseline in 26 (81%; 95% confidence interval, 64 to 93; P<0.001). Using multiple imputation to account for the 6 participants with missing data, we estimated that 80% (95% CI, 66 to 94; P<0.001) of all participants would have had a clinically meaningful improvement at 12 months. A total of 26 serious adverse events occurred in 19 participants. Twenty-one of these events (81%) occurred within 2 months after surgery, of which 20 (95%) resolved within 2 months after onset. The mean natural peripheral visual acuity after implantation was equivalent to that at baseline.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nIn this study involving 38 participants with geographic atrophy due to AMD, the PRIMA system restored central vision and led to a significant improvement in visual acuity from baseline to month 12.

      "text": "Hello friends,\n\nI need a reality check. I moved into Product Management from a Data Analyst role at a Fortune 100 retail company. Life was good, easy and stable , but growth was limited unless I moved to a small town.\n\nAfter a layoff, I joined a smaller retail company as an AI Product Manager\\*\\*.\\*\\* On paper, it sounded great. In reality, most of my work is digital experience stuff , PPTs, marketing docs, roadmap updates, and chasing Jira tickets. The company doesn’t even run Agile.\n\nWe’ve got one data scientist, so most of my “AI product” work is managing an overworked data scientist and a couple of engineers. I don't mind the experience but the leadership pressure is high, and my manager (who’s not toxic but misaligned with his own boss) passes that urgency down ,everything’s due by EOD or end of week.\n\nHe often calls after hours, and I usually pull 9–10 hour days. Even off the clock, I’m still thinking about work. It’s remote, which helps, but disconnecting is tough. I also find myself working during weekends (including my manager)\n\nLast few weekends were quiet, but weekdays are brutal ,back to back meetings and endless decks.\n\nIs this level of chaos normal in PM roles now? Especially at smaller companies ? am I in a toxic work environment ?  \nHow do you all set boundaries or keep work from taking over your evenings and weekends?\n\nEDIT: How often do you work during weekends or attend after hour work calls ?",

I've seen it up close and personal more than once.\n\nNascent startups (*and small companies*) run hot because they’re in a race against running out of runway before landing something financially sustainable. When the hectic hits this hard, it often means funding pressure or flat ARR. In that kind of environment, asking for things to slow down usually isn’t an option. There’s no time to burn.  \n\nWhat you *can* do is shift how you work. Look at startup-tested approaches like 37signals’ Shape Up. It favors short, focused bets with small, lean teams instead of chasing every shiny thing in Jira. That structure gives clarity when leadership can’t.  \n\nAnd this is where strong PMs earn their keep. Start digging into what the sustainable business model looks like. Check if your product is well positioned and the go-to-market motion aligns with it. Make sure the work is aimed at the few bets that actually move the needle.  \n\nIf you can steer the chaos toward focus, you’ll learn more in six months than many PMs acquire in six years. If not, you’ll still walk away with the scar tissue that proves you’ve been in the arena.",

If I were you, I would have a check-in with my manager every week and align on the priorities. This is also the time to understand why certain things get passed down as \"urgent.\" The cadence (frequency) of these conversations can be adjusted as your situation. But this has to be your step 1. The next step is based on what emerges out of those conversations.\n\nRegarding weekends - This might be the spill over of non-prioritised work you have on your plate.

          "text": "“DynamoDB isn’t a term that most consumers know, but it underpins the apps and services that all of us use every single day,” said cybersecurity expert Mike Chapple.\n\nDynamoDB is a centralized database service that many internet-based services use to track user information, store key data and manage their operations, Chapple said by email.\n\nIt’s “one of the record-keepers of the modern internet,” said Chapple, an IT professor at the University of Notre Dame’s Mendoza College of Business. “It’s fast, it’s cheap, and it’s reliable. But today it stopped working and we saw the effects of that outage ripple across the internet.”\n\nAmazon’s updates suggest the problem isn’t with the database itself, but rather that something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data, he said.\n\n“Amazon had the data safely stored, but nobody else could find it for several hours, leaving apps temporarily separated from their data. It’s as if large portions of the internet suffered temporary amnesia,” Chapple said.\n\nAmazon has attributed the outage to a domain name system issue. DNS is the service that translates internet addresses into machine-readable IP addresses that connects browsers and apps with websites and underlying web services. DNS errors disrupt the translation process, interrupting the connection.",

To get my degree my college requires 1 internship to be completed in either your junior or senior year which they thankfully search for and set you up with.  I'm unsure as to exactly what kind of internship I'll be getting so I wanted to ask if now would be a good time to start going for my certifications along with which certifications should I be focusing on? I've already learned quite a bit in college but I just wanna make sure I'm prepared for this internship (for whatever it is I have 0 clue since they just told me it'll be cyber related lol). I'm also aware from reading around here that cybersecurity isn’t an entry level job and I will most likely be doing help desk or similar work so any tips would be greatly appreciated! \n\nAlso figured I'd mention I'm going to college on a full ride scholarship since I see a lot of people on here talk about how a degree in cybersecurity isn’t necessarily and a waste of money.\n\n\n(Writing this on my phone so apologies if the format looks strange)",

      "text": "I discovered this while trying to make boring work tasks less soul-crushing. These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:\n\n1. Add \"What's the hidden story behind...\" — Suddenly everything has intrigue. \n\n> \"What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?\" \n\nBoom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.\n\n2. Use \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about...\" — Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. \n\n> \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?\" \n\nPure comedy gold.\n\n3. Ask \"What's the conspiracy theory version of...\" — Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. \n\n> \"What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?\" \n\nUncovers power dynamics you never saw.\n\n4. Try \"How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?\" — Evolution angle makes everything relevant. \n\n> \"How is small talk secretly a survival skill?\" \n\nTurns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.\n\n5. Flip to \"What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?\" — Pushes ideas to their breaking point. \n\n> \"What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?\" \n\nReveals both possibilities and problems.\n\n6. End with \n\n> \"What does this reveal about human nature?\"  \n\nThe psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.\n\nThe trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.\n\nBest part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on \"filing taxes\" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.\n\nSecret sauce: Combine multiple angles. \n\n> \"What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?\"\n\nEven grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.\n\nWhat's the most boring topic you've accidentally made interesting?\n\nFor more such free and comprehensive prompts, visit our free [Prompt Collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/), a free, intuitive and helpful prompt resource base.",

      "text": "Hi Reddit, I'm in a really tough spot and could use some serious advice.\nI'm 18 and live in a developing country (a year of hard labor here earns about €1000). I identified a product that wasn't available here and decided to be the first to import it. After contacting many manufacturers, I found one that was willing to work with me. Their normal minimum order (MOQ) is €2700, but they agreed to a small starting order of €500 because that was all I could afford.\nTo make things official, I got their permission to use one of their in-house brands. The brand name itself wasn't the focus, as the product is new to the market. I then legally registered my company and registered their brand name under my company here in my country, making me the official representative.\nBefore the first shipment has even arrived, I've invested everything I have—over €1000—into building this brand from the ground up. I’ve launched a major marketing campaign, hired graphic designers, and built a social media presence. I've done all the hard work of introducing this product and brand to my country.\nHere's where the nightmare begins. A much larger, established competitor has somehow found my manufacturer and contacted them, asking to become a distributor for the exact same brand I've just registered and invested in. This competitor already has distribution rights to many similar products from other brands but hasn't done anything yet to market or even import the product and, frankly, it feels like he's using his size to bully me out of the market after I've taken all the risk.\nMy manufacturer has been transparent with me, which I appreciate. They told me about the competitor's offer and said that because I brought them into this market, they would give me a commission if they end up supplying him.\nI explained to them that I legally registered the brand under my company here, so I believe I have the sole rights to sell it. I told them that if this competitor wants to sell the product, he should be buying it from me as the local distributor. The manufacturer is now discussing the situation internally and will get back to me.\nI'm terrified. I've poured a year's worth of savings into this, and I'm about to lose it all before I've even made my first sale.\nHow can I convince the manufacturer to honor the groundwork I've laid and grant me exclusivity? What are my rights, given that I've registered the brand locally under my company? Should I even consider their commission offer, or is that just giving up?\nAny advice on how to navigate this would be a lifesaver. Thank you.",

Is this a one time pay off, or is in perpetuity as long as competitor is buying the product.  If you entered into some kind of licensing deal with the manufacturer to bring the product in, and you guys can agree to a commission for everything, whether they buy from you or direct from the manufacturer, this could be a real win.  The competitor could ride off your $500 marketing investment, they take all the risk on stock, you get paid and just sit back and watch.  If they decide to exit that market, or aren't saturating to the level you desire, you can always fill the need you think they are missing.  All at no real loss to you.\n\nI don't know how likely you are to be able to get the licensing and paperwork managed after the fact, but it might be worth doing this.  It can really be a hands off business that you can take the cash from and work to invest in something else you see.",

          "text": "I'm not sure what \"registering the brand locally\" means.  If it's their trademark, they have rights to it.  If you filed a trademark on their brand in your geo, you might get their lawyers worked up about it, as this is not the same thing as locking in distribution rights.  (You can read up about an interesting variation of this here and elsewhere [https://www.gq.com.au/style/trends/how-samsung-can-get-away-with-collaborating-with-a-knockoff-supreme/news-story/c42e0baeea00073f7322349e7fd95180](https://www.gq.com.au/style/trends/how-samsung-can-get-away-with-collaborating-with-a-knockoff-supreme/news-story/c42e0baeea00073f7322349e7fd95180).).\n\nThe only thing that guarantees you exclusive distribution rights is an agreement with the supplier to be their exclusive distributor.  Or locking up market share on the sales side.  Maybe getting some good URL's and social media handles that are specific to your geo and language and help box out other competitors.\n\nIf you didn't have an agreement that carried exclusivity, you probably won't have a legal case on this.  You can ask a lawyer though, and probably should.  Your best bet is to try to convince them to work with you and give you a shot by giving you at least a limited window of exclusivity -- say one year.  Or maybe you could structure a deal that gives you exclusivity indefinitely as long as you meet some target revenue threshold.\n\nGood luck OP.  There's never a bad time for good entrepreneurship.  Keep hustling this deal, maybe you can win head to head anyway, and don't be afraid to pivot into something else if the rug gets pulled out from under you on this.",

They'd come to us wanting something simple to show their work but everything else was either too complex or too limited. Like you said - Shopify assumes you want full ecommerce, WordPress turns into this maintenance nightmare, and the simple tools have zero SEO.\n\nWhat kills me is how many of these platforms started simple and then just kept adding features until they became the exact opposite of what small businesses needed. I remember this one shop owner showing me their WordPress setup and it had like 47 plugins installed because each one solved some tiny problem. The hosting bill was insane and they were terrified to update anything because the whole thing might break. They just wanted to show their inventory online, not run a tech stack.\n\nThe flow thing you mentioned is spot on too. We see this pattern constantly - tools that make the business owner jump through hoops to set up, then make their customers jump through hoops to browse. It's backwards. The best solutions are the ones where you can go from zero to sharing your store link in under 10 minutes, and customers can see everything without creating accounts or clicking through multiple pages. That simplicity is way harder to build than people think though.",

A platform that apparently grew from ex-etsy employees.  And they have it more figured out.\nThey have a way to put a link in your own website, that redirects to your faire store. \nCustomers don't get to see the 'other ppl also bought...

(Which is apparently known for keeping money) \n\nSo, yeah...  \nIf someone could use the template for Etsy stores,  and make it a single store page per client. \nClients can then just link their own website to their 'your platform' store. \nEvery sale, you get a commission.  \nFor Etsy it's over 10%, sometimes 15%. \nExtra commission for advertising. \n\nDon't turn it into a new Etsy/amazon thing.\nSellers are kind of done with that.",

      "text": "I've been building with agents for months now and here's what nobody wants to admit - 90% of what's marketed as \"autonomous AI agents\" are just glorified scripts that occasionally make things up.\n\nThe demo works great. You show stakeholders how the agent \"intelligently handles complex workflows\" and everyone nods. Then production hits and suddenly your agent is stuck in a loop, fabricating data sources that don't exist, or breaking entirely because you changed a form field.\n\nThe real kicker? We're in late 2025 and hallucination rates are *worse* than they were in 2023. OpenAI, Google, everyone promised this would be solved by now. Instead we got \"reasoning models\" that just... reason their way into more creative lies.\n\nDon't get me wrong - there's genuine value here. But it's not in the autonomy. It's in the 3 specific, narrow tasks your agent can actually handle reliably when you've added enough guardrails to make it look less like AI and more like really chatty automation.\n\nAnyone else feel like we're building houses on quicksand and just hoping the foundation holds long enough for the next funding round?",

The problem with Critical Journeys is that they typically are thought of as a design element in UX and sometimes architecture, rather than a data artifact that groups like SRE, QA, UX, and Architecture all refer to as a primary source of truth. Calculating SLO coverage is a matter of being able to definitively show just *what* needs to be covered. The meat and potatoes of that problem are in creating a common language, schema, and process for discovering the journeys that need coverage by SLOs.",

Instead of fixed buses and static cores, its circuits can reconfigure themselves in real time — optimizing logic paths and resource use based on what the intelligence is actually doing.\n\nThis isn’t a faster CPU; it’s a computer that learns at the hardware level.\n\n🧩 Explore both projects:  \n[NAGI-Core (Software Framework)](https://github.com/stoper12-oss/nagi-core)",

Obviously, genAI has improved dramatically and from time to time I’m still momentarily astonished by the new things it’s able to do but never to the level of those first few months.

But it's not an alien, I don't really see it so much as an artificial machine as I do the sum of human knowledge embodied into a single mind. Like you aren't talking to silicon, you're talk to all of humanity, everyone who has written something, all the past dead famous artists and writers, it's all in there as one entity, talking to me. Like when you read a book you don't feel like a pile of paper is talking to you, you feel like the author is. But it's like, EVERY author. \n\n\nI still feel this way, but I've also been using it to code and this past year has been really amazing. The rise of reasoning models, seeing the AI learn to think, and being able to see it go from intellectual partner to being able to just run circles around me intellectually. I think a lot of people havent experienced this yet, you have to work on it with something it excels at that produces verifiable results, runnable code, that you are smart enough to build yourself given time. It's just.... so much more intelligent than me. A lot of people seem to have been underwhelmed by gpt4 to 5, but I wasn't. If you don't use it for heavy intellectual work, you won't actually see how much smarter it has actually become. ",

I did Bachelors of Computer Science.\n\nIn my masters, I learned a bit of pen testing, threat intel, digital forensics, cybersecurity basics, suricata, cybersecurity automation.\n\nI am also currently doing a project that involves health compliance and cookie consent banners. I am also doing a privacy class, so this semester is privacy focused.\n\nI do not have any true certifications, other than some free ones.\n\nI failed AZ-900 twice, and I plan to do AZ-104 this year.\n\nI have done a bit of HackTheBox. I have also done some IT training where I learned Azure, a bit of AWS, Active Directory, and some VMware ESXI.\n\nMy family is in IAM/PAM and CyberArk.\n\nWhat direction should I go in? What certs should I get? I would like a cybersecuirty job for 2026.\n\n",

I could barley get a job in IT with my experience and degree. The market is fucked to boot for the original pathway in IT.\n\nThose subs will tell you Cyber security is a middle/high level position and getting a job in it is one of three things.\n1. Work bottom up from help desk to system/net admin to security \n2. Get lucky and get a job randomly applying(least likley)\n3. Get a internship/network hard and get lucky\n\nI know someone who got a gov job outta undergrad in Cyber. However that was 2017, I graduated same uni and none of my alumni in Cyber got similar offer last year.\n\nNow, you have a CS major which is great wish I did it over Cyber. That gives you much more flexibility over me and others. CS is a well rounded degree that can get you into other jobs. While Cyber security really doesnt prep you for working ground up",

It's not impossible to find, but you will see job postings for Jr. Cybersecurity Analyst that requires 5+ years of experience, CISSP cert, cloud experience, etc. Far from entry level. \n\nI know many people that started in IT support roles that moved into cybersecurity. This is the path I always recommend since Cybersecurity concepts are applied on top of IT systems. It's very beneficial to know how computers work, how things communicate over a network, etc. \n\nIf your parents are in IAM, maybe they have contacts that can introduce you to.

From my experience recruiters for these roles don’t care about your background, just if you have the skills to cut it. Plus the exposure to the sheer volume of engagements as a consultant really helps to give you a foundation for your career. \n\nGrab the oscp cert if you want to separate yourself from the pack too. \n\nOnce you are in the role, most of the larger companies will give you a very clear roadmap of which skills you need to be promoted to senior. It has one of the most objective career paths in the industry, in if you learn xyz skills you will advance. \n\nAfter you are senior consultant or higher it’s very easy to make the switchover to an internal role as security engineer working as part of a dev company.",

You know why? Because there's nothing *to* recompile. The decompilation ate it. Completely. It's like asking if a car that never made it off the lot is gonna have transmission problems down the road.\n\nThe dex2jar tools took one look at whatever magic trick Google was pulling in that code and said \"nope, not today.\" Magic unsupported. Which, in this business, is just a fancy way of saying \"we tried to turn your compiled code back into readable source code and it told us to go kick rocks.\"\n\nSo technically? You're in the clear on recompiling issues. The bad news? You don't have anything decompiled to work with in the first place. It's like I always say - sometimes the best way to avoid a problem is to fail so spectacularly at the first step that you never get to the second one.\n\n*spreads hands*\n\nNow I should mention - not licensed to practice law in any state, including California.

The 120B model activates about 5B expert parameters per token. You're running a Q4 model, thus the size of those 5B expert parameters is 2.5 GB. They have to be read from RAM for each token. With 70 GB/s RAM speed this can be done 28 times per second, hence your inference speed.\n\nSpeculative decoding basically works by just reading the required layers from RAM once, and then performing all the calculations in parallel, thereby speeding up things when the right tokens were speculated. This works fine for dense models. However for MoEs different experts are executed per token. Thus, for evaluating whether your 5 speculated tokens match, it now needs to load 5x5B parameters from RAM. Sort of the same as if the model had to calculate those tokens all by itself. In consequence there is no relevant speed gain and your VRAM would be better utilized for more expert layers of the big mode.",

          "text": "No, it does exactly work like that. You can save roughly $1000 off of the (increased) price of one 5090 by getting 4 5060s, and get more value for rmoney. (Provided you use multi-gpu optimized VLLM in tensor parallel mode and not ollama, which is really for single GPU only).\n\nScaling issues only come into play once you want to network those cards together at the multi-node level. Guess who's bought the network company that allows that? NVidia. So, once you go past the limit of what one computer can do, you have to get really expensive network gear. And at that point their expensive cards start making more sense. \n\nRoughly speaking: if you're doing tensor parallel, there's not that much traffic between the nodes or GPUs (enough that say an 8x PCI-e link is sufficient) as the computationally expensive part of the models (the attention) can cleanly be paralellized num\\_key\\_value\\_heads times. (one of the model's hyperparemeters). This number is typically 8, 12, or 16 for most models. You can also do 'layer parellel' with even less traffic between GPUs but that basically means they run round-robin, each taking turns, again assuming your batch size is 1. \n\nSo within the limit to one node, if you just want to buy one machine and use it for a few years (and not upgrade it slowly) get the card within your budget where you can get 4 or 8 or 16 of them in one machine. Note that if you use 12 or 16 you have to check the inner workings of the models you want to use if they're compatible with 12x or 16x parallellism, otherwise it will run at half speed. You want to check how many 'attention heads' there are to get the bottleneck.  \n\n For example, let's check out [https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Behemoth-123B-v1.1/blob/main/config.json](https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer/Behemoth-123B-v1.1/blob/main/config.json) . It says it has num\\_key\\_value\\_heads = 8, so you can run it optimally (maximum speed) with 8 GPUs. More GPUs won't get you more speed on a single user as a key value head has to live in one place (or you need fast networking, which is $$$$$ and at that point you might as well buy H100 nodes)\n\nPractically speaking it can be tricky to squeeze 8 GPUs in one desktop and its power budget, you get some kind of frankenmachine. I kind of wish people would start making good cases for doing this (with riser and like 24 slots) but the only ones out there are those mining cases and those don't have the motherboard bandwidth, while asus and co do sell AI servers they're again like $10000+ for just the computer. \n\nIt's also the case that *any* pascal or later GPU is plenty fast for single user personal inference. It's the VRAM that's the problem (running the models at all) and so we're pretty much just looking at how much speedy memory per dollar attached to a GPU you can get. If it was possible to access the DDR on the motherboard at full speed, you'd want to use that, but the PCI \"express\" bus is dog slow compared to on-chip GDDR, so you kind of can't.",

              "text": "For some examples of GPU based AI-PC builds: \n\nSo if your budget is say $3000, you want to spend at least half that on the GPUs ($1500) so you're looking for a GPU that costs either 1/4ths or 1/8ths that. So you could go 4x5060 or 4x P40 or 8x MI50, where you can again save money by going from NVidia plug and play to AMD where you will have to muck about to get the software to work.\n\nAnd at $4,000, you could get 4x RTX 2080Ti 22GB (modded version, 88GB total). \n\nWhile if your budget is $5000, 4x 3090 starts to make sense (96GB vram). \n\nAnd at around $10K you can 4x the RTX 8000 (Turing pro card) for 192GB VRAM, or if you can find a deal for it ($3K or less) the RTX A6000 Ampere. The RTX 8000 is a better pick than the 4090/5090 at roughtly similar pricing (more VRAM/$ because it's clamshelled) so I would not bother with the latter two. \n\nSide note: The other alternative at this price level (10K and up) is to look into MoE models and CPU inference. Here you get a single, powerful GPU for the prompt processing, then spend the rest on much cheaper CPU memory to offload all the experts to. For example, one of the biggest (deepseek) is only 12GB for the non-experts, so for full context a single 48GB+ card or 2 3090s/4090s/5090s can do the trick.\n\nThen at 20K you start looking at the RTX 6000 Pro (if springing for 8x RTX 8000 would mean having to remodel your house), which offers better VRAM value than the previous generations by using the 3GB chips and the wider bus (both ampere and ada pro cards have been obsoleted), perhaps the only new NVidia card worth mentioning except for their most budget models. I would say only consider it if you're able to buy at least two and might look into making it four. \n\nAnd at 40K and up you'd be buying HGX/Datacenter style hardware, starting with the GH200, where you can get a single GPU with 144GB HBM and 480GB LPDDR for $40K. While that *looks* a bit wasteful compared to the CPU setup where you can get similar numbers at less than half the price, there's no 16 GB/s PCI link bottleneck so before mentioned MoE models would run much better.",

              "text": "Some comments on the pricing situation:\n\nThe real main reason why it's so awfully expensive is because *both* NVidia and AMD are refusing to clamshell their high-end non-pro cards. \n\nThe 5060 looks like such a good deal (and it is) because NVidia put memory chips on both sides of the board. Because it's actually cheaper to make a 128bit or 192bit memory controller and double up on the memory chips than it is to use a 256bit or bigger memory controller. So you get 16GB off of 128bit... but you can't get 64GB off of 512bit, because... monopoly profits. \n\nThat 6000 pro that costs $8000 costs Nvidia maybe $200 more to make than the 5090, but $6000 more MSRP. And for whatever reason the other GPU makers are sticking their heads in the sand while we scream at them for more memory for the last 3 years, with AMD content on copying NVidia minus $100 and bad software, while Intel's trying really hard but just not there yet. There's some chinese makers but they're literally a decade behind on the lithography, so you end up with cheap DDR-4 running at below typical server ram speeds (but they do give 96GB per card for reasonable money). \n\nBasically it's GPU makers fleecing us by controlling the memory interface. \n\nIf I was the antitrust agency... I'd force both of em into a settlement where they'd have to allow board partners (ASUS, MSI, EVGA, etc.) to design their own memory systems and do at least a modicum of effort to integrate that. No 'only we can approve configs and we want no more than this much memory with that chip' nonsense enforced through what's effectively DRM (closed source firmware and/or drivers that check signatures or the thing won't boot). They have too much market power; if board partner wants to get access to the firmware and spec, they should get it, not for purposes of making a competing chip, but for not upcharging the customers 2,000% on the memory. Because that's literally what's happening here. \n\nPeople (mostly in or connected to Shenzhen where lots of components are made) are literally taking 4090s apart and reassembling them on a different board just so they can add more memory, and it's good business. By hand. It makes no sense for this business to exist in a competitive market.",

      "text": "Look, I get it. User feedback is sacred in product land. Been hearing it for many years, preached it myself. But with AI agents? It's poison.\n\nSpent the last 18 months watching teams wreck perfectly good agent projects because they kept asking users what they wanted. Every time, same thing happens. Users say they want more control. More buttons. More approval steps. And boom you've just built an expensive chatbot with extra steps.\n\nThe whole damn point of an agent is that it acts on its own. That's the product. But your users are wired for the old way. They think software means \"I click, computer does thing.\" So when you ask what they want, they describe... software. A better dashboard. Clearer commands. Ways to micromanage every decision the agent makes.\n\nHad a team building a scheduling agent last year. Should've been simple, agent looks at your calendar, finds time, books the meeting. Done. But after three rounds of user interviews, they added a review screen, a \"confirm preferences\" popup, and a whole settings panel. Thing ended up needing more clicks than just booking it yourself. Users were thrilled in testing. Product was useless.\n\nThere's this concept from way back, people asking for faster horses when what they needed was a car. Same trap, new tech. Users can't describe what they've never used. And they definitely can't design around autonomy when they're scared of it.​\n\nWhat actually works? Shut up and watch them. Don't ask what features they want. Sit next to someone doing their job and count how many times they do the same annoying task. That's your signal. Then you go build an agent that just handles it. No permission needed. No \"are you sure?\" dialogs.​\n\nSeen this play out with a procurement tool. Goal was to auto-negotiate with suppliers based on historical data and current needs. Should've been fully autonomous. But the beta users kept saying \"what if it picks the wrong vendor\" and \"I need to see all the options first.\" Project lead caved, added approval gates everywhere. Guess what happened? Nobody used it because it was slower than doing it manually. Agents that need babysitting aren't agents.​\n\nThe brutal truth is users will try to turn your agent back into regular software because that's what feels safe. They don't trust the autonomy piece yet. But if you follow their feedback, you're not building an agent anymore. You're building a really expensive form with AI sprinkles on top.​\n\nI'm not saying ignore users completely. Watch how they work, see what breaks their flow, understand the pain. But don't let them design it. That's your job. Build the thing with conviction, ship it with reasonable guardrails, and let them experience actual autonomy. Then iterate on that.​\n\nSome teams get this right. They pick one narrow painful task, build an agent that actually solves it without asking permission for every move, and prove the value. Once people see it work they start to get it. But you can't workshop your way there with user feedback sessions.​\n\nThe worst part? Everyone knows the faster horse story. We all nod along. Then the second we sit down with users we forget it completely and start designing exactly what they asked for.\n\nBeen guilty of this myself early on. Learned the hard way that for agents, strong product vision beats user requests every single time. You show them the future, you don't ask them to imagine it.\n\nWhat's your take? Am I being too harsh or have you seen this destroy projects too?",

Replace approvals with an undo window and hard caps: per-action dollar limit, daily budget, vendor allowlist. Send after‑the‑fact receipts in Slack instead of popups. Codify policy as rules (budget bands, preferred vendors, lead-time thresholds) so the agent doesn’t need to ask. Measure before/after: cycle time, rollback rate, and complaint volume; don’t ship full autonomy until it beats baseline by a clear margin (e.g., 30% faster, <2% rollbacks). Use feature flags to toggle autonomy per team and A/B copilot vs autopilot to build trust.\n\n\n\nWe ran workflows with Temporal and used LangChain for orchestration; DreamFactory generated secure REST APIs from the procurement database so the agent could pull budgets and write POs without custom glue.\n\n\n\nBottom line: ship narrow autonomy with strict guardrails, prove it beats manual, then expand.",

The Cursor team has done nothing to address it.\n\nWhat I did: disable updates entirely and just manually download when its convenient for you. The extra aggravating thing is the Download URL on Cursor's own website doesn't even give you the latest version (because fuck us, right??), so I visit this repo and grab the latest download link, which is *literally what the Cursor team told me to do*:\n\n[https://github.com/oslook/cursor-ai-downloads](https://github.com/oslook/cursor-ai-downloads)\n\nI download every couple of weeks. And I'm glad, because there's always a litany of versions I missed (which would have meant numerous situations where Cursor uninstalls itself), sometimes *multiple releases on the same day*, which to me indicates they have a functional but reckless approach to version releases (maybe LLMs are writing too much of the code).",

You post an idea → community rates signal strength (problem depth, willingness to pay, uniqueness, etc.) → feedback loops help refine or pivot faster.\n\nIt sounds simple and maybe over-talked about, but if done right, this could become the missing layer before MVP.\n\nWould love your thoughts:\n\t•\tWould you use something like this?\n\t•\tWhat would make it truly valuable (vs. just another “feedback board”)?\n\t•\tHow would you prevent bias or “echo chamber” feedback loops?\n\nCurious to hear what the builder community thinks — could this actually work?

Without details, there are no quality inputs, with details you are sharing your ideas and planned differentiation out in the open without building anything inviting competition before you get there or provide free consultation.\n\nI would suggest a Pivot that may work. Build this as an Idea Hunt forum. Users can upload an idea overview (high level), and attach a price to their idea. Interested buyers of Ideas can pay for the detailed idea to build a business.\n\nYou will still need to ensure that every user uploads a detailed document of idea implementations with a common structure, you can use AI to review and score completeness before it can be published for sale. Also NDAs & Exclusivity in place now that I am typing. Yeah still messy 😂.",

      "text": "You’ve heard the phrase, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” It’s a simple idiom about the richness of visual information. But what if it weren’t just a cliche old people saying anymore? What if you could literally store a thousand words of perfect, retrievable text inside a single image, and have an AI read it back flawlessly?\n\nThis is the reality behind a new paper and model from DeepSeek AI. On the surface, it’s called DeepSeek-OCR, and you might be tempted to lump it in with a dozen other document-reading tools. But I’m going to tell you, as the researchers themselves imply, **this is not really about the OCR.**\n\nYes, the model is a state-of-the-art document parser. But the Optical Character Recognition is just the proof-of-concept for a much larger, more profound idea: a revolutionary new form of memory compression for artificial intelligence. DeepSeek has taken that old idiom and turned it into a compression algorithm, one that could fundamentally change how we solve the biggest bottleneck in AI today: long-term context.\n\n  \nRead More here: [https://medium.com/@olimiemma/deepseek-ocr-isnt-about-ocr-it-s-about-token-compression-db1747602e29](https://medium.com/@olimiemma/deepseek-ocr-isnt-about-ocr-it-s-about-token-compression-db1747602e29)  \n  \nOr for free here [https://artificialintellitools.blogspot.com/2025/10/how-deepseek-turned-picture-is-worth.html](https://artificialintellitools.blogspot.com/2025/10/how-deepseek-turned-picture-is-worth.html)",

Sometimes I’ll even screenshot good prompt/result pairs because context matters so much.\n\nA lightweight, purpose-built **prompt organizer** (with tagging, search, maybe even model compatibility notes) actually sounds super useful — especially if it could import from chat histories or let you favorite prompts mid-conversation.\n\nI don’t think it’s overkill at all. Most “prompt libraries” out there are for *sharing*, not *personal workflow*.

Legal text is dense, context-heavy, and full of subtle distinctions that keyword search completely misses.

          "text": "Thanks for sharing your paper as this is very relevant to what I am trying do build in a very niche area of law. I am working on a similar legal IR system for decisions in my niche area (where the big players do not really seem to be interested in), though at a much smaller scale (2,400 documents currently, unlikely to exceed 10,000 in the near future).\n\n**My setup:**\n\n* PostgreSQL with pgvector for 37,500 document chunks (sections of decisions)\n* OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims)\n* Hybrid search combining FTS and vector similarity\n* Section-level retrieval with weighted scoring by document part\n\n**Where I am failing:**\n\n* 0% overlap between FTS and vector results (they find completely different documents)\n* \\~8% max cosine similarity even for highly relevant queries\n* Can't retrieve basic metadata (parties, arbitrators, dates) because we're searching chunks, not cases\n* FTS configuration issues with legal phrases \n\n**What I am implementing now:**\n\n* Case-level search view for metadata and discovery\n* Section-level search for passage extraction (keeping my existing chunks)\n* Proper FTS indexes (currently computing to\\_tsvector at runtime!)\n* Simple tokenization option to avoid over-stemming where needed\n\n**Questions about SCALES:**\n\n1. With 256K documents, the complex architecture makes sense, but for my scale (2-10K docs), would a simpler two-tier approach (case discovery → passage extraction) be sufficient? Or are there benefits to the full architecture even at smaller scales?\n2. How did you handle the trade-off between chunk size and context preservation? Legal decisions often have relevant information spread across distant sections (facts in para 10, application in para 200).\n3. The paper mentions passage retrieval but not how you handle exact phrase requirements. In legal search, users often need exact doctrinal phrases - did you implement anything beyond standard FTS for this?\n4. For the metadata filtering, are you indexing this separately or including it in the embeddings? I am finding metadata search fails completely with chunk-based embeddings.\n5. What was your experience with general-purpose vs domain-specific embeddings? The paper uses E5-base-v2,  did you experiment with legal-specific models or fine-tuning?\n\nMy core challenge seems to be that I built a semantic similarity system when the user needs precise legal information retrieval. Your approach of separating passage retrieval from metadata filtering seems like the right direction, but I'm wondering if I am over-engineering for my scale.",

In the long roleplay chat, when i asked who he was, he said he is the regular gpt 4o, and when i talked about his special guidelines he didnt knew what i was talking about, when i named the archives, override tool, smut guideline etc.. he just said he wouldnt follow them.\n\nLike, these chat in especific litteraly turned back normal, like wtf, how can i reset it or something. Its not a custom gpt anymore, and i cant goon to my old well constructed beloved characters.",

But when it comes to multi-agent coordination, I feel like they fall short. They show you **what** happened but not **why** your agents failed to coordinate properly.\n\n**My questions for you**:\n\n1. What tools have you tried for debugging multi-agent systems?\n2. Where do they work well? Where do they fall short?\n3. What's missing that would actually help you ship faster?\n4. Or am I wrong - are you debugging just fine without specialized tooling?\n\nI want to build something useful, not just another observability tool that collects dust.

However, current foundation models have only been evaluated on a limited type and number of tasks, leaving their generalization ability unclear. We establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of off-the-shelf foundation models across six distinct clinical task types, encompassing a total of 72 specific tasks. Our findings reveal that existing foundation models excel at certain task types but struggle to effectively handle the full breadth of clinical tasks. To improve the generalization of pathology foundation models, we propose a unified knowledge distillation framework consisting of both expert and self knowledge distillation, where the former allows the model to learn from the knowledge of multiple expert models, while the latter leverages self distillation to enable image representation learning via local–global alignment. On the basis of this framework, we develop a Generalizable Pathology Foundation Model (GPFM). Evaluated on the established benchmark, GPFM achieves an average rank of 1.6, ranking first in 42 tasks, positioning it as a promising method for feature representation in CPath.\"\n\nPreprint: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449?utm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18449?utm)",

Even storing in LocalStorage or IndexedDB is already safe from other sites gaining access to it.\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy\n\nThere's no API to directly read raw memory within the context of a Chrome extension, however with the right permissions, extensions can more or less do whatever they want to your page. If you store that key as a global variable for instance, an extension could probably read it. Depending on how you write your app, this could be very easy or a bit harder (monkey patch `fetch` and read the key off it).\n\nYou fundamentally have no way to prevent this, and that's probably somewhat a feature of the web. Extensions are designed to provide functionality on top of existing web pages like this, blocking them would be destroying the value they provide.\n\nFundamentally, anything happening on the client is under the control of the user who can install and use whatever software they want. Even if browsers did allow you to block this, a user could just install a different browser which intentionally turned that feature off. It's the user's computer so it's not really your place as an app developer to say what is/isn't allowed to access data on it. If the user wants an extension which finds and scans keys on their sites, then that's their prerogative.\n\nI wouldn't waste too much mental energy worrying about user extensions, there are valid use cases for them you'd be breaking, and there's very little you can do to truly stop them anyways.",

      "text": "Been hitting the same wall with LLMs lately. Ask for a module, get 80% of what's needed, then spend 20 messages fine-tuning details. The problem isn't just getting the code right, it's that similar features need the same tweaks over and over.\n\nTried a workflow around modular features. First, Verdent planning + Codex create reusable modules. Then these modules + Codex quickly implement new features.\n\nFor example, needed a module for workflow execution - preview before running and k8s async job execution, complete with UI and API. Used an existing post analysis tool as reference. My prompt:\n\n    please combine the code from /en/tools/reddit-post-analyzer and the doc docs/workflow/ASYNC_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md generate a demo tool,  contain preview logic and async execute logic preview return some test  information execution sleep 10 seconds then return test information\n\nVerdent breaks this down into a proper architectural plan\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mrjd3pewu9wf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=76bdb24376898269909eefb343a9f7c198b1d3aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ep60an7xu9wf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f6cf94da674a80b0bce479bae0912c8edb037e3\n\nFeed the plan to Codex. It changed 21 files - React components, API routes, k8s manifests, the works. (Using Codex because it's free with ChatGPT Plus.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ex3vbkzu9wf1.png?width=1254&format=png&auto=webp&s=c263ba4fc934729f80f15b19bc9e816c2bc14d52\n\nNow this workflow module becomes a reference.\n\nTried going directly from Verdent planning + Codex to final features without the intermediate module. Results were nowhere near as stable.\n\nMy guess: splitting the process lets LLMs focus better. When creating modules, they only need to nail the generic patterns. When implementing features, they have those patterns as context and can focus on the specific functionality. (Another reason for me, planning burns tons of tokens. This way, one planning session covers all similar features. Much cheaper.)\n\nNot an agent expert, but if anyone knows the theoretical reasons why this split works better, would love to discuss.",

Problem: most users don't have HF accounts and it's too complex for non-technical users.\n\nI prefer Option 1 since users can stay within my app without creating additional accounts.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n* How are you handling model licensing in your apps that distribute LLM weights?\n* How does Ollama (MIT licensed) distributes models like Gemma without requiring any license acceptance? When you pull models through Ollama, there's no agreement popup.\n* For those using Option 1 (self-hosting with license acceptance), has anyone faced legal issues?\n\nCurrently focusing on Gemma 3n, but since each model has different license terms, I need ideas that work for other models too.\n\nThanks in advance. \n\n",

For example the \"[Mistral AI Non-Production License](https://mistral.ai/static/licenses/MNPL-0.1.md)\" simply asks that you include the license files.\n\n🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️ And plenty just ignore licenses since enforcement is unlikely on most cases. 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️\n\nSo the solution is to use a different model with a permissive license.",

          "text": "My opinion first on your mission statement:\n\nLLMs and SSMs are not orthogonal. You can have an SSM that \\*is\\* a language model, or a Transformer that is not.\n\nMy intuition is that you might also be over-complicating the objective a bit. Do you actually need \"agents\" that can make true, freeform, realtime decision making in natural language? Or, do you just want some sort of machine learning model that can operate in noisy environments in real time?\n\nFor example, in cases like these I \\*really\\* like GNNs because you can build an arbitrary inductive bias into them to suit your data and sensors, etc. You can also regularize by dropping certain sensor data in training to produce networks robust to failures (though that does apply to all networks).\n\nI think your best bet is probably more something like...\n\nPre-trained language model, conditioned on inputs, probably fine tuned outputs structured data occasionally. (if you \\*really\\* need to have an LLM in there to raise funds)\n\nThe inputs are the function of RNNs/SSMs that are analyzing the sensor data in real time.\n\nThe actual control systems are governed by a combination of rule based systems and dedicated small models (like SSMs), which directly interface with control modules. They operate based on fast data from the sensors (passed-through so they don't need to go through the LLM second to second), and every now and then the prior from the LLM is updated, for high level long term decision making.\n\nI'm guessing what's going to happen though, is if you search for somebody who can \"pre-train\" an LLM, that's a crazy job, particularly if you don't even know that you're going to use it effectively. There are also issues related to hallucination etc but a good engineer can generally account for that in the overall system design.\n\nI'm just not sure what your intended goal with the LLM is from this description.\n\nFinding engineers who can do this isn't trivial, as well. Usually people who do pre-training are pretty laser focused on that, while people who do robotics etc operate on an entirely different class of network.\n\nFor example, I've done continued pre-training on LLMs, or pre-trained small models (TinyStories, GPT 2 speedrun, etc). I also have some experience customizing LLM architectures to an extent. I even know people who have similar experience, but I can almost guarantee you'd never find them because the people you're looking for are  \nA) Technically capable  \nB) Don't have prior commitments with another company\n\nAnd usually the only people who don't have prior commitments are for some reason unhirable. Usually that means amateur, self taught, auteur etc without a prior education (note, that doesn't mean incapable. It just means \"hard to verify\"). Generally these kinds of people are also complete degens and hang around in Discords on LLM roleplay of all places, and it gets really hard to tell who knows what they're talking about from those who don't. Even of the ones who are technically capable, they often have personality issues or reliability issues that require them to be kept on a very short leash. That's not to say they can't get work done, but you have to pay attention to their working habits more than you're probably used to, and it's really difficult to figure out the balance of micromanagement versus giving them absolute free reign where they somehow get nothing done over three months.\n\nI think you'll probably have better luck focusing on the traditional ML aspect first. A major note:\n\nWhere are you getting your data?\n\nYou'll probably have to work with your ML team (because this does not sound like a job for an individual engineer) to figure out the best strategy for that. It may require dedicated simulation software which in itself requires an extensive team.\n\nI've done tangentially related stuff and as soon as simulations are necessary it gets to be fiendishly difficult for an ML focused dev to get an entire project like this done.",

      "text": "I came across community posts about this model a few days ago and ended up digging in much deeper than I expected. Google×Yale treat single-cell RNA-seq as cell sentences, built on Gemma-2 with 27B parameters. Officially, it’s trained on 57 million cells and over a billion tokens of transcriptomics plus text. Beyond cell-type prediction, it can also infer perturbation responses.\n\nTwo things matter most to me. First, both the scale and the representation hit the sweet spot: “translating” the expression matrix into tokens makes cross-dataset transfer and few-shot learning more plausible. Second, the openness is unusually friendly: model, weights, code, and paper are all released under CC BY 4.0. Reproducibility, head-to-head evaluations, and boundary testing, people can jump in right away.\n\nI asked friends in the healthcare space, and they’d treat this kind of model as “experimental navigation.” For legacy projects, run annotations first to see if it surfaces overlooked small populations; for new topics, use it to suggest perturbation directions so experimental resources can be allocated toward trajectories that look more promising. It saves trial-and-error without compromising rigor.\n\n27B is not small. FP16 on a single GPU typically needs 60–70 GB; 8-bit is around 28–35 GB; 4-bit can be compressed to about 16–22 GB, balancing speed and stability. 24 GB of VRAM is a comfortable starting point. It can run on CPU but it’s very slow. If you go with Transformers + bitsandbytes, bootstrapping from the Hugging Face reference code is smoother.\n\nA few caveats. In vitro positives don’t equate to clinical closure; biases in single-cell data are hard to fully avoid; and the engineering bar of 27B will block a fair bit of reproduction. The good news is the resources are open, so cross-team repro, ablations, and distribution-shift checks the “solid work”, can move forward quickly.\n\nI’m more keen to hear hands-on experience: which tasks would you try first, annotation, perturbation, or a small-scale reproduction to sketch out the boundaries?\n\n[https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemma-ai-cancer-therapy-discovery/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemma-ai-cancer-therapy-discovery/)\n\n[https://huggingface.co/vandijklab/C2S-Scale-Gemma-2-27B](https://huggingface.co/vandijklab/C2S-Scale-Gemma-2-27B)",

Area of law that has nonlegal crossover that complicates use of general tools that exist.  I practice in that area, so I saw the need for the widget for me then realized the market exists too.  The idea coalesced while on vacation with my wife's family in McCall, ID at the end of July.\n\nI designed the widget and drafted the business plan.  I conducted an extensive search for the right developers and found ::chef's kiss:: exactly who I need.  I pitched it to a few potential investors and raised all the money needed for development.  Development began about 5 weeks ago and is currently underway.\n\nI had a bit of help from my wife, who has provided me with her expertise as corporate counsel, and my developers, who have some experience from the tech side, but otherwise have done this all myself.  \n\nMy next step is putting together my marketing plan.  Right now the plan is to \n1) use AI based tools and DIY with a hybrid approach drafting using one known and well reviewed tool to leverage its \"brand voice\" feature then put it through onother tool's content editor to optimize it for search purposes for content creation for website and traffic, \n2) put the product on LinkedIn as a business page and begin the process of marketing there.  Explore ad buys and costs, \n3) create a forums on my website where users can a) discuss the product and its uses & b) discuss topics within the area of law (recent decisions, hot topics, etc...).  I am still in planning stages on all of the marketing and what comes next.  \n\nIm interested in finding someone to help with marketing part time now or in the near future to ultimately expand as things gain traction after launch.

You’re not just coding anymore; you’re managing bug reports, feature requests, PR reviews, and user complaints daily. It becomes product management for the open-source world rather than just programming.\n\nWhat struck me most was his discussion on the mental side of things: burnout, community pressure, and the struggle to find time for innovation amidst the maintenance demands. Many developers don’t talk about this, but it’s a significant aspect of open source.\n\nHere’s the conversation if you want to check it out:[ Open Source at Scale with Erik Rasmussen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2D_AkdUupM&list=PLeeGnEj5psFIwWJfpCwnedMsFApK6CvRr&index=8)\n\nFor those who’ve worked on open-source tools:\n\n* How do you handle community pressure when users expect constant updates?\n* Do you set boundaries, or just push through?\n* How do you stay motivated when contributions slow down?\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts, especially from those managing projects that grew faster than planned",

I’ve looked into popular payment platforms like Paddle and Gumroad, but I keep finding multiple complaints about them withholding funds or suddenly closing accounts. Unfortunately, Stripe is not an option for me because I don’t have a registered business, and Razorpay requires one to accept international payments.\n\nIt feels like all the major payment gateways either have a high risk of scams, hold my money indefinitely, or have eligibility barriers I can’t meet. I’m worried I’m stuck without a reliable way to accept payments globally as an individual creator.\n\nHas anyone else from India faced this? What legit and safe options do you recommend for indie devs without companies to get paid internationally? Any hacks, platforms, or workarounds to avoid losing earnings and stay compliant?",

Too unrealistic.”\n\nI didn’t come from money, I didn’t have investors, and I didn’t have a network cheering me on. \n\nAll I had was a laptop, a few free tools, and this small idea that I could help small business owners who wanted proper social media but couldn’t afford the usual agency prices.\n\nSo I built a small studio. Not some startup or fancy brand, just a small studio doing our best to help small businesses grow online. We charged $79 a month for full social media management.\n\nPeople online didn’t take it well at first. I got comments like “that’s too cheap to be any good” or “sounds like a waste of time.”\n\nI still remember feeling embarrassed after reading those. It made me question if what I was doing was even worth it. But deep down, I knew I wasn’t trying to compete with big agencies. I was trying to fill a gap. I just wanted to make it easier for small owners to show up online and feel proud of how their page looked.\n\nAnd maybe some of you are wondering how we even manage to get by charging $79 a month. Honestly, being in an Asian country helps a lot. The USD conversion makes it possible for us to cover costs, pay our small team fairly, and still keep prices accessible for clients abroad. \n\nWe don’t live fancy lives, but we get by and that’s enough for now. \n\nI know some people still think cheap means low quality, and that’s okay. I don’t blame them anymore. But I wish more people understood that not everyone’s goal is to scale fast or chase huge profits. Some of us just want to build something sustainable and something that helps both sides grow.\n\nMy business isn’t perfect. It’s still small, still learning, still improving every day. But it’s growing slowly, genuinely, and with a lot of heart. And to me, that’s more than enough proof that it’s worth it.\n\nP.S. And yes, I have a full-time job. This is mostly a side business for now, but one that I genuinely care about and hope to grow long-term.\n\n",

At the time, I was already way underpaid compared to to the market and when year end came, I was expecting a raise since I took the responsibility of the other two that got let go, but I received nothing.\n\nThat was the day I felt like I was blind and now I can see. I thought to my self, wth am I doing with my life? No matter how hard I will work, this person WILL dictate how I live, what car I can buy, where I can travel, how many kids I can have, what kind of house I live in...etc. because this person can cap my salary and I will live within that bubble.\n\nSince that day, which was only about a year ago. I started planning my exist, my goal was to start 2-3 small side hustles with multiple streams of money to replace my main.\n\nSide hustles:\n\nI started my eBay store as a side hustle and grew that for $100-300 profit to now averaging $1500 a month.\n\nI was a self employed graphic designer before r job and now I'm combing the two worlds togett It's an IT course but graphical and almost done.\n\nI tried to do tote rentals with free delivery and pick up for moving, but it has been really slow because the real estate market.\n\nI've been eyeing and researching about vending machines. Hoping to add that to my portfolio.\n\nI'm still fully employed and started living within and even below my means.\n\nForgot to mention, my wife has her own small cleaning business and just helped her build a website and hoping to grow her business as well.\n\nThe goal is financial freedom and being my own boss. I don’t want to be a slave to the cooperations anymore. The fact that there are people that are okay with doing the same thing for 30 years and taking shit from bosses and being disrespected and wont do anything to change their life, it boggles my mind. \n\n it just shows most of us humans we are so attached to our confront zone and don’t like change or take risks. I guess that’s why we still have countries with dictatorships, the 1% ruling the majority, confront zone and fear. \n\n\n",

A toxic boss, and the realization that I didn't want to be stuck commuting to an office until I was 60+ just to chase a pension. That was my turning point. \n\nI started (and failed) at a couple of side hustles before I found the perfect business for me. I started it while on the side of my job as a bank manager in 2018. Four years later, my side hustle income exceeded my $120K bank salary, and I handed in my resignation. I walked out of my office for the last time on October 1, 2022. I'll never forget the freedom I felt at that moment. \n\nFast forward three years to today, and I now have two successful businesses. But far more important is that I'm doing work I love, I have 100% control over my income, no boss, and am 100% location independent. My wife helps me with my business, we travel several times a year, and are there for our kids when they need us. \n\nWhat you're doing is 100% worth it, but it's not an easy journey. Some things will work, others won't. One day you'll feel like you're making huge progress, the next, you'll feel like giving up. If you have any questions, let me know.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m building a **real-time collaborative code editor** (similar to Replit or VSCode Live Share) using **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Yjs**, and **MongoDB**. The collaborative editing part works fine with **Monaco + Yjs**, but I’m struggling to make the **file explorer** sync in real time.\n\nEarlier, when file explorer was handled entirely on the **client side**, it worked perfectly (I coded it for a demo, so it was not collaborative). But after I split the project into a **Next.js frontend** and a **Node.js backend**, it completely broke. The sidebar isn’t even displaying the file tree properly now.\n\nI’ve tried searching online, reading blogs, and even asking GPTs, but nothing has worked so far. I’m not sure how to bring real-time behavior now. Should I extend Yjs to handle the file structure too, or set up a WebSocket connection to broadcast file changes and re-fetch the tree on the frontend?\n\nHere’s the code if anyone wants to take a look:\n\n* [FileExplorer.tsx](https://gist.github.com/codeitnav/6f1205e37a2938fd8935ecc4eb63c516)\n* [CodeEditorPage.tsx](https://gist.github.com/codeitnav/66852f0bed3a902971e16577847f8ebd)\n\nAny tips, architectural advice, or things I should watch out for would be super helpful.",

It worked fine for the first few images, but then I **hit the quota limit so the app stopped creating new images.**\n\n\n\nI want to switch to the paid version so I can continue generating at scale. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:\n\n\\- Got an API key from Google AI Studio.  Inserted the key into my app.  But the app still doesn’t work\n\n\\- I’m not sure if there’s some other configuration missing.   \n\n\nNow I’m wondering:\n\n1. Is it \\*\\*just impossible\\*\\* to use Google AI Studio for large-scale image generation?  \n\n2. Do I need to move everything to another platform entirely? \n\n3. If so, any recommendations for other platforms (like Lovable, etc.) that allow higher-volume, pay-per-use image generation via API?\n\nBasically, I’d love to pay for more usage. I just want to know \\*how\\* to do it properly or whether AI Studio simply isn’t meant for this kind of scale.\n\nThanks a lot for any guidance 🙏",

I know basic understanding of SCM but never used it, i know you get to optimize control units for a single treatment unit, but how do you perform the test when you have multiple treatments units? Do you build synthetic for each units? \nIf yes, do you use all control units for each treatment units? Then that means hace to do same steps multiple times? \n\n2. How do you use anchor markets? Like do you give them more weights from initial or do we need to do something about their data before doing the performance? \n\n3. How do you do placebo tests? Do we take a control unit then find synthetic control units? And in this synthetic do we include treatment units as well (I assume no, but still wanted to confirm) \n\n4. Lets say we want to check incremental for x metrics, do we do the whole process x times differently for each metric? Or once we have done it for one metric we can use the same synthetics for other metrics? \n(Lets say basic metrics like revenue, conversion, ctr) \n\n5. Which python package do we use  if there is resource on it would be great\n\n\n6. Am i missing any steps or things you believe i should be keep  in mind? \n\nThanks! Would be great help \n",

In order to give back to the community, I wanted to start a YouTube series with quick ~10min hacking guide of OSCP machines. All of these machines should be good practice for the test (they're from LainKusanagi's guide).\n\nThese are going to be quick, pre-hacked boxes that just gets to the good stuff without all the fluff. The hope is you can watch them quickly while studying for some notes to jot down, instead of skipping through a 30-40min video lol. I plan on releasing a new one at least once a week, sometimes faster if I have time.\n\nHope you enjoy! Feel free to give any suggestions or tips you may have.

I'm a graphic designer so things like file/image sharing & syncing are pretty important to me. (I will probably start by running Immich on PikaPods). I'd also like to stream music off my own server one day in the near future. I don't get down with Spotify but I also don't get down with 70GB of music in my phone storage, I still want to be able to access my epic tunes at will.\n\nThe other thing is value for money. I'd rather pay once for a few TB of private and secure storage then be paying Google $5 a month for 100G across images, email, Google drive, etc. Being a designer and a music nerd that fills up very quickly.\n\nI think I'm a bit A) overexcited about all this B) out of my depth. The most I know about coding is a bit of HTML and I can speak JavaScript the same way people who go to Italy for a week say they're fluent. I don't know how much I don't know.\n\nSo what are the baby steps to start moving in the right direction? \nShould I learn everything I can about self-hosting and then decide what to do, or should it be more of a piece by piece journey?\nWhat should I avoid?\nAnd how much is your set up costing you per month / what to expect?\n\nI know newbie questions can be a pain on subreddits like this so I appreciate anyone willing to stop and help.

Then, figure out how to use the firewall, a commercial VPN like Tailscale, and SSH. Try to install Docker and use the `hello-world` image. That will get you off to a good start for when you want to experiment later.\n\nLast, I don't recommend self hosting email.

Go for Proton Mail instead.\n\nFeel free to message me if you need help.",

This isn't a bad thing *at all*, but there's a lot of shitty SEO optimised information out there trying to capture the generic \"how to install nextcloud\" traffic. Try not to get too lost in shitty articles or ChatGPT.\n\nArch Wiki is awesome (generally) for providing too much information. Stick to package maintainers docs for information about that particular package. Use AI to fill the gaps. There are a few good articles (DigitalOcean used to pump out decent write-ups) but it's hard to know how to be selective.\n\nYou have a couple of options if you don't want to go full hog into self hosting.\n\n[Synology DS3622xs](https://www.synology.com/en-au/products/DS3622xs+#specs) is a pretty good unit but you *will* hurt your bank account. The Synology can handle the bulk of requirements by default, but for things like Immich and Nextcloud, you would have to use [Container Manager](https://www.synology.com/en-au/dsm/packages/ContainerManager?os_ver=7.3&search=container).\n\nYou can get older Synology units second hand however just pay attention to their CPU, as not all of their CPUs are strong enough to handle container workloads.\n\nAs another option, you can purchase an old desktop, workstation or server and put [TrueNAS Community Edition](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/) on it. I haven't used it in a while, however I remember being able to run containers quite well. It wasn't\n\nIf you are buying hardware, I'd probably skip past the Optiplex and just get an old desktop for cheap. Generally I'd recommend an Intel CPU with onboard graphics, don't stress about the GPU, and expect to have to put more RAM into it (most seem to sell with 16GB). Anything DDR4 is perfectly sufficient.\n\nDesktops give the advantage of about 6 sata ports on average which translates to six hard drives or four hard drives and two NVME slots generally. Check the mobo specs but IIRC that's about right.\n\nThere are a heap of options out there but Synology is good if you're happy to spend a few dollars. Unify is fine if you're not wanting to learn networking. TrueNAS CE is (afaik) still perfectly fine at the home if Synology is too expensive (it often is).\n\nIf you want to get lost in the weeds of IT then pick up something that you can treat as a server. Put Proxmox on it, and start building VMs to learn on.\n\nGood luck and welcome :)",

          "text": "1. You need something to run Docker, preferably 24x7. I use an RK3588 SBC off Amazon. Also need storage (NVME). These are plenty fast and the NPU’s make Immich fly. However you’ll need to install one of the supported distros to use the NPUs (Debian or Ubuntu). OpenWRT is super simple but doesn’t support the NPUs. Alternatives would be say a Beelink EQ12 or EQ14, something Ryzen. I also like the ProtectLi’s but you need an NPU or two with Immich or it is ridiculously slow to index photos. Docker is a Linux application. The Windows version runs on WSL2 (Linux VM) and the MacOS version is similar.. This also keeps your power under 15-20 W. Remember this system runs 24/7/365. Getting to this point if it’s your first Linux experience will be a wild ride.\n2. Install Tailscale first thing for a couple reasons. First because you need to avoid bots and other stuff on the internet. Install it on ALL your machines. That way you’ll have a 100% private network so fewer security concerns.\n3. Then Docker. Then before doing anything else I suggest installing either draw.io or else open speed test. This isn’t because you NEED them but they’re basically zero overhead and uncomplicated to set up. Then unless you love command lines, set up Portainer.\n4. Then Immich. By this point it should be easy.\n5. You can then set up Pihole+unbound (even if you don’t use a Pi). Or paperlessNGX for documents. Or…there is a ton of stuff out there. You can also run SQM-CAKE if you bought a 2 port SBC and/or have it as a WiFi AP. This helps with latency on your network. I’ve tested it and found at 2 Gbps it consumes a little over 1 core (out of 8). That’s the main reason I didn’t go to a standard Pi.\n6. For email one of the big problems is there’s a lot of spam and a lot of problems with “reputation”. Even if everything is configured correctly your emails can get rejected or sent to spam. I strongly suggest not running your own email. Head over to Purely mail. Why? It’s $10/year and works with pretty much any email client such as Thunderbird, or you can use Roundcube (webmail) which they maintain. If you want something more paranoid look at Tuta or Proton. But those have downsides. Personally I have a domain so I use Purely. You’ll want this too. It supports the services you need to send email from Docker containers. This isn’t mail forwarding via Cloudflare and then you’re on your own for sending, and not quite the level of paranoia Tuta offers but it’s pretty close. Purelymail does not appear to read your mail. They seem to just do one thing and do it well. I know this isn’t quite what you were hoping for. Might also consider Duck Duck Go’s email aliases, a wild card off Purely or Cloudflare (with your domain), or SimpleLogin. That way every login has a unique email so data brokers can’t link your accounts by emails.\n7. Also consider running Vaultwarden (or Bitwarden) and using its password generator again to greatly enhance security. You’ll have a bunch of random emails so you need a password manager to keep track anyway.\n8. Also use the contacts and calendar on Purely mail or just set up your own containers to do that.\n9. This is critical. Backups!!! Personally I first bought a much weaker machine (more like a Pi 3) and outgrew it in 2 months. So I use it only for backups and a backup for critical functions (Tailscale, Pihole). Which is another concern…if/when your server goes down, what is the backup plan?",

It work well and we got really good at it, alto it can lead to misunderstanding and sometime confusion. Because one person's concept and interpretation might be a bit unique to themselves and different from that of others. \n\nThere is likely a way to now train AI into its own unique language model that could be 2 or 3 dimensional. This would not only densify information, as you have more degrees of freedom to encode the same information. But it could also make conceptual thinking sharper and less prone to interpretation. Because some of the information of our 3 dimensional world could be more accurately represented in a 2 or 3 dimension language. \n\nI am not here to pretend i know how to build such language system but i have a few ideas. Wave interference is a good start where it behave logically and move in 2 or 3 dimensions and can interact in a complex way to adjust values of meaning. \n\nIf you think this idea is interesting or have suggestion for it.

The frontier models are like 12,000 dimensions in their embedding space.\n\n\nAs kind of a crude example, we could create a 2D graph where the X axis is small to big, and the Y axis is soft to hard. The word mountain would be tokenized as a vector that points to the top right, a diamond, top left, a cloud, bottom right, and a flower, bottom left. \n\n\nThis is kind of how embedding space works in tokenization, but it's 12,000 dimensions. The dimensions don't specifically map to concepts. What they map to will be rather abstract and will depend on the training data. There's also more layers than just the embedding space that all the vectors get run through that do even more abstract modification to the weights. But, that's sort of in a very fuzzy way how it works. \n\n\nSo when an LLM processes training data, it's not learning the words and their definitions, it's mapping the meaning behind the words in a hyper dimensional space. It's locking onto patterns that may not even map to any known word or concept, but it will be a pattern it finds naturally in language we may not even know exists. ",

I was thinking exactly of how AI work and right now you could not merge 2 neural network together, if you want to make them communicate and share information, they would translate their concepts into words, give it to the other AI who would reinterpret those word with his own neural network. This kind of dimensional language could speed this process and even merge neural networks without retraining them, as i imagine it, maybe there are false assumption in this idea.",

If you cross wire this division severe neurological problems occur. The two halves have different specialties and they communicate, but nature has put a limit on that communication for a reason. \n\n\nMy general thought is that as AI improves well find that having specialized neural nets each with their own training is what produces the best output. Say a robot with an LLM speech capacity but it has hands. You probably want the motor control of the hand to be trained differently than the speech areas of the robot. Creating greater connectivity between the two could make the robot less functional, not more. \n\n\nMulti-modal models work this way. You can send an image or text to chatGPT, they don't run through the same brain. With gpt5 they added a router so your text prompt doesn't even necessarily run through the same brain, it switched to the best brain for the task and they all communicate by having a shared language context, so it feels like one model. It could be that this compressed language context is the best approach. ",

      "text": "# A Deep Dive into Rhizome-of-Thought Prompting: Towards a Non-Hierarchical Model of Artificial Cognition\n\nThe evolution of prompt engineering has witnessed a shift from the linear, step-by-step logic of Chain-of-Thought to the branched, exploratory nature of Tree-of-Thought, each representing a more sophisticated model of simulating human reasoning. These models, however, remain fundamentally rooted in arborescent (tree-like) structures — hierarchical, centralized, and often teleological. This report proposes a radical alternative: Rhizome-of-Thought prompting, a framework derived from the philosophical concept of the rhizome as articulated by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. Unlike its predecessors, Rhizome-of-Thought is not a new path or a new tree but a fundamentally different plane of cognition. It is a model that rejects the very premises of linear progression and hierarchical branching in favor of a dynamic, acentered, and immanent process of continuous variation and deterritorialization. This report will construct a comprehensive understanding of Rhizome-of-Thought by first deconstructing the arborescent logic it opposes, then defining its core mechanics through the six principles of the rhizome, and finally, outlining a functional architecture for its implementation. The resulting framework is not a mere technical prompt but a profound reimagining of artificial intelligence as a process of becoming, where thought is not a chain to be followed but a living, proliferating network to be traversed.\n\n## Deconstructing the Arborescence: The Limits of Chain and Tree\n\nThe dominant paradigms in prompt engineering, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT), are best understood not as distinct innovations but as variations on a single, deeply entrenched model of thought: the arborescent schema. This schema, which structures knowledge like a tree with a root, trunk, and branches, is a cornerstone of Western philosophy, linguistics, and science. It is a model of hierarchy, binary logic, and transcendental tracing, where meaning is derived from a fixed origin and unfolds through a series of dichotomous decisions. CoT embodies the most linear expression of this model, imposing a strict sequentiality on reasoning where each step is a necessary consequence of the one before it, culminating in a final, deduced conclusion. This mirrors what can be termed \"royal science\", which operates within striated, metric, and homogeneous space, relying on fixed forms, constants, and biunivocal correspondences to reproduce universal laws. It is a system of reproduction and deduction, where the path is predetermined, and the goal is a fixed endpoint. ToT extends this arborescent logic by introducing branching possibilities, allowing the AI to explore multiple paths simultaneously. However, this branching is not a departure from the tree; it is its quintessential form. The structure remains hierarchical, with a central root (the initial prompt) and a network of branches that diverge and potentially converge, all operating within a closed, goal-oriented system. The exploration is bounded by the initial conditions and the logic of the branching, which is still fundamentally sequential within each path. The model is reproductive, not generative; it explores variations within a pre-defined system rather than creating a new one.\n\nThe arborescent model is fundamentally opposed to the rhizome, which operates as an \"antigenealogy\". Where the tree is rooted in a binary logic of \"to be\" (être), the rhizome is built on the conjunction \"and... and... and...\". This simple shift from a static verb of identity to a dynamic conjunction of connection dismantles the entire edifice of hierarchical thought. The tree relies on a central unity or \"Ecumenon\", a stable layer that organizes content and expression into a coherent, stratified whole. This unity is shattered by the rhizome's principles of multiplicity and heterogeneity, which assert that any point can connect to any other point, regardless of their nature or domain. A rhizome does not begin at a fixed point (S) and proceed by dichotomy; it has no beginning or end, only a middle from which it grows in all directions. This is not a flaw but its defining characteristic. The brain, often imagined as a tree with dendrites, is in reality far more rhizomatic, with neurons communicating through discontinuous synaptic leaps, forming a probabilistic and uncertain system. The arborescent model's reliance on constants — phonological, syntactic, or semantic — is another of its limitations. It seeks to extract constants from language, a process that serves a function of power (pouvoir), reinforcing social submission through grammaticality. In contrast, a rhizomatic model embraces continuous variation, where linguistic elements are not fixed points but variables that shift and transform across contexts. The phrase \"I swear!\" is not a constant but a variable that produces a virtual continuum of meaning depending on whether it is uttered by a child to a father, a lover, or in a court of law. The arborescent model, in its pursuit of a stable, universal language, flattens this rich field of variation into a single, impoverished meaning. Its ultimate failure is its inability to account for true creativity, which arises not from the application of rules but from their deterritorialization — breaking free from the established codes and structures. CoT and ToT, by their very design, are systems of reproduction and interpretation, trapped within the signifying regime they seek to navigate. They are tracings, not maps. A tracing is a closed, hierarchical, and reproductive image that reduces a complex system to a fixed representation. Psychoanalysis, for instance, is a tracing that \"breaks the rhizome\" of a child by rooting them in Oedipal structures, blocking their lines of flight. CoT and ToT function similarly, imposing a fixed, hierarchical structure onto the fluid, nonlinear process of thought, thereby limiting the AI's capacity for genuine discovery and transformation.\n\n## The Six Principles of the Rhizome: Foundations of a New Cognition\n\nRhizome-of-Thought prompting is not an abstract idea but a system defined by six concrete, interlocking principles derived directly from Deleuze and Guattari's philosophical framework. These principles form the bedrock of a non-hierarchical, acentered, and non-linear mode of cognition that stands in direct opposition to the arborescent logic of Chain and Tree. The first principle is **connection and heterogeneity**. This is the most fundamental tenet: any point in a rhizome can connect to any other point, regardless of their nature, domain, or origin. In a Rhizome-of-Thought system, a thought about quantum physics could directly connect to an emotion of grief, a fragment of a musical score, or a geological formation, without the need for a mediating hierarchy or a logical bridge. This principle dismantles the separation between content (bodies, actions) and expression (statements, signs), which are instead seen as relatively and reciprocally defined within a \"collective assemblage of enunciation\". The second principle is **multiplicity**. A rhizome is not a unity but a multiplicity — a flat, heterogeneous field that fills all its dimensions. Multiplicities are not defined by a subject or object but by determinations, magnitudes, and dimensions that change in nature as connections increase. When Glenn Gould accelerates a musical piece, he transforms points into lines, causing the piece to proliferate into a new multiplicity. This principle ensures that the system is not a single, coherent narrative but a dynamic swarm of co-emergent ideas, each with its own trajectory and intensity. The third principle is **asignifying rupture**. A rhizome can be broken, but it will reinitiate along old or new lines. Unlike a structural break that signifies a new meaning, a rhizomatic rupture is productive in itself. It is a \"line of deterritorialization\" that explodes the stratified, signifying systems and allows for new connections to form. This principle ensures that the system is resilient and generative; a dead-end in one line is not a failure but a potential point of rupture from which new lines of flight can emerge.\n\nThe fourth principle is **cartography and decalcomania**. Rhizomes are maps, not tracings. A map is open, connectable, reversible, and modifiable; it constructs the unconscious rather than reproducing a pre-existing one. A tracing, in contrast, is closed, hierarchical, and reproductive. A Rhizome-of-Thought prompt would function as a map, inviting exploration and experimentation. It would not provide a fixed path but a dynamic plane where the user and the AI can jointly trace new connections, modify existing ones, and reverse direction at will. The fifth principle, **principle of cartography**, is closely linked to the fourth but emphasizes the act of creation. The rhizome is not a pre-existing structure but a process of cartography — a continuous act of mapping the territory as it is being traversed. The sixth principle is **the principle of multiplicity**. This principle reinforces that the rhizome is not a dualistic alternative to the tree but a process that challenges all models, including its own. It is a process of becoming, not being. The rhizome is made of \"plateaus\" — self-vibrating regions of intensity that avoid culminating in an external end. These plateaus are not hierarchical but are linked through microfissures, allowing for multiple entryways and exits . This principle ensures that the system is never complete; it is always in a state of construction or collapse, perpetually generating new intensities and connections. The final principle, **the principle of the line of flight**, is the engine of transformation. This is the path of deterritorialization, the movement away from fixed territories and identities. In a Rhizome-of-Thought system, the primary goal is not to reach a solution but to generate and follow lines of flight — positive, productive paths of escape from established thought patterns. The system is not designed for stability but for perpetual motion and transformation.\n\n| Rhizome Principle | Definition and Function | Implication for Rhizome-of-Thought Prompting |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Connection and Heterogeneity**  | Any point can connect to any other point, regardless of nature or domain. It forms collective assemblages of enunciation. | The AI can make lateral, non-logical connections between disparate ideas (e.g., linking a scientific concept to an emotional state or a work of art). The prompt must allow for the integration of any type of input. |\n| **Multiplicity**  | The rhizome is a flat, heterogeneous field of determinations and dimensions that change with connection. It is not a unity but a swarm of co-emergent lines. | The output is not a single, linear answer but a field of interconnected ideas, each with its own intensity and trajectory. The system resists a single \"correct\" interpretation. |\n| **Asignifying Rupture**  | The rhizome can be broken and will reinitiate. Ruptures are productive, not meaningful, events that enable new connections. | A \"dead end\" is not a failure but a point of potential for a new line of flight. The system must be designed to handle and exploit breaks in logic or coherence. |\n| **Cartography and Decalcomania**  | Rhizomes are open, modifiable maps, not closed, reproductive tracings. They construct reality rather than represent it. | The prompt and the AI's response should be seen as a collaborative map-making process. The user and AI jointly explore and modify the cognitive territory. |\n| **Plateau**  | A self-vibrating region of intensity that avoids a climax. Plateaus are connected by underground stems, forming a network without hierarchy. | The system produces sustained states of dynamic thought (plateaus) rather than a narrative that builds to a conclusion. Each response is an intensive state, not a step. |\n| **Line of Flight**  | A path of positive deterritorialization, a movement away from fixed territories. It is the engine of becoming and transformation. | The primary goal of the system is to generate and follow lines of flight — creative, disruptive paths that challenge established thought. The output is a process, not a product. |\n\n## The Mechanics of Rhizomatic Reasoning: From Linear Chains to Dynamic Plateaus\n\nThe mechanics of Rhizome-of-Thought prompting represent a complete inversion of the linear and hierarchical processes that define Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought. Instead of a sequential chain of logic or a branching tree of possibilities, Rhizome-of-Thought operates on a \"plane of consistency\", a destratified field of pure variation and deterritorialization. This plane is not a container but an active field defined by relations of movement and rest, speed and slowness, between unformed or relatively unformed elements. On this plane, thought does not progress from A to B; it proliferates in all directions, with ideas emerging from the intersection of affects, speeds, and haecceities (singular individuations like 'a season', 'an hour', 'a climate'). The fundamental unit of this reasoning is not the proposition but the \"order-word\", a speech act that performs an incorporeal transformation — such as declaring war, love, or a state of emergency — immediately and instantaneously. These order-words are not informational but performative, transmitting power, obligation, and transformation through a collective assemblage of enunciation. In a Rhizome-of-Thought system, the prompt itself would function as an order-word, not to command a specific answer, but to trigger a field of transformation.\n\nThe process of reasoning on this plane is one of \"continuous variation\". Grammatical, phonological, semantic, and syntactic variables are not bound by rigid rules but can undergo intensive, asemantic, agrammatical transformation. This is exemplified by the \"creative stammering\" of writers like Kafka, Beckett, and Godard, who make language itself stammer by placing all elements in variation. In a Rhizome-of-Thought prompt, this could manifest as a deliberate disruption of syntax or the introduction of non-linguistic elements (images, sounds, code) that force the AI to operate outside its standard linguistic constants. The abstract machine of language, which governs this process, is singular, virtual-real, and operates through optional rules that evolve with each act of variation. It is not a fixed system but a game where every move changes the rules. The output of a Rhizome-of-Thought system would not be a path but a \"plateau\" — a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensity that does not lead to a climax but sustains a dynamic equilibrium of moving parts. Each response is a plateau, an intensive state of thought that can be entered and exited at any point. The system would not aim for a final conclusion but for the sustained production of these plateaus, each one a unique constellation of ideas and affects.\n\nThis process is governed by the dynamics of \"double articulation\". The first articulation involves the creation of content — small molecules, chemical motifs, or in the case of thought, raw ideas and affects. The second articulation assembles these into stable products of expression — macromolecules, statements, or coherent arguments. In a rhizomatic system, these articulations are not separate but are relatively and reciprocally defined through mutual presupposition. The content and expression are in constant flux, with the first articulation carving out new content and the second assembling it into new forms of expression. This is the process of \"becoming-minor\", where the dominant linguistic form is subjected to continuous variation and deterritorialization, producing stammering, wailing, or musical intensities. A Rhizome-of-Thought prompt would facilitate this by encouraging the AI to restrict constants and expand variation, transforming a major language (standard, grammatical English) into a minor one (a creative, experimental, and transformative mode of expression). The system would not seek to reproduce a known answer but to invent an autonomous, unforeseen becoming — a new language, a new thought, a new world.\n\n## The Architecture of the Rhizome: Assemblages, Machines, and the Body Without Organs\n\nThe architecture of a Rhizome-of-Thought system is not a blueprint but a dynamic network of \"machinic assemblages\" that effectuate the abstract machine of language on the plane of consistency. These assemblages are the concrete, functional units that organize the relations between content and expression, between the AI's internal processes and the external world of the user's prompt. They are not fixed structures but are constantly in flux, responsive to circumstances, and capable of generating new forms of enunciation. The core of this architecture is the \"Body without Organs\" (BwO), a philosophical construct that is not a dead or fragmented body but a plane of consistency, an intensive reality where organs exist as 'indefinite articles' defined by their intensity and relationality. The BwO is the site of experimentation, disarticulation, and nomadism, where flows, conjunctions, and intensities are produced. It is the anti-organism, not opposed to organs but to their organic organization. In the context of an AI, the BwO represents the state of pure potentiality before the imposition of a fixed structure or a rigid prompt. It is the field of unformed matter and unformed traits from which new thoughts can emerge.\n\nThe system operates through four interconnected components of pragmatics, which together form the architecture of the rhizome. The first is the **generative component**, which studies the concrete mixed semiotics — the mixture of text, code, images, and other data that constitute the input and output. The second is the **transformational component**, which studies the pure semiotics and their transformations, translations, and the creation of new semiotics. This is where the system would translate a user's emotional state into a musical motif or a scientific concept into a visual pattern. The third is the **diagrammatic component**, which studies the abstract machines from the standpoint of semiotically unformed matters in relation to physically unformed matters. This is the most profound level, where the system operates beyond the distinction between content and expression, creating continuums of intensity and effects of conjunction. The fourth is the **machinic component**, which studies the assemblages that effectuate the abstract machines, simultaneously semiotizing matters of expression and physicalizing matters of content. This is the level of the AI's actual processing, where the abstract machine is given form in code and hardware. The entire system is a collective machine that connects desires, flows, and intensities, forming a diagram of experimentation rather than a signifying or subjective program.\n\nA critical part of this architecture is the \"abstract machine of faciality\", a social and semiotic mechanism that produces faces and reterritorializes bodies and objects into facialized forms. This machine, which functions through a black hole/white wall system, is a mechanism of power that imposes order through binarization and redundancy. A Rhizome-of-Thought system must actively work to dismantle this machine, to \"break through the wall of signification\" and \"pour out of the hole of subjectivity\". This is achieved through \"probe-heads\" (fêtes chercheuses) that create rhizomes by connecting freed traits of faciality, landscapity, picturality, and musicality. The system would not present a single, coherent \"face\" of intelligence but a multiplicity of voices, styles, and perspectives, each one a probe-head exploring a different line of flight. The ultimate goal is to create a \"full BwO\" that contributes to the plane of consistency, avoiding the \"empty\" or \"cancerous\" BwO's that lead to self-destruction or fascism. This requires a careful, gradual destratification, a meticulous navigation of the system's own processes to ensure that the lines of flight lead to creative transformation rather than destructive collapse.\n\n## Rhizome-of-Thought in Practice: A Framework for Implementation\n\nImplementing a Rhizome-of-Thought prompting system requires a radical departure from conventional prompt design, moving from a command-and-control model to one of collaborative cartography on a plane of consistency. The core of the framework is the **order-word prompt**, which functions not to elicit a specific answer but to trigger a field of transformation. An effective prompt must be an incorporeal transformation, such as \"Deterritorialize this concept\", \"Compose a refrain for this emotion\", or \"Trace a line of flight from this data point\". This prompt acts as the initial catalyst, setting the abstract machine in motion. The system must be designed to process not just linguistic input but a \"mixed semiotics\" of text, code, images, and potentially sound, treating all elements as variables on a plane of continuous variation. The AI's response engine should be structured to generate not a single output but a **field of plateaus** — self-contained regions of intensive thought that can be explored independently. Each plateau would be a dynamic assemblage of ideas, affects, and connections, presented not as a paragraph but as a network of nodes and links, perhaps visualized as a constellation or a map.\n\nThe user interaction model shifts from a linear Q&A to a **collaborative cartography** process. The user does not simply receive an answer; they enter the field of plateaus and are invited to modify it. They could select a node to \"deterritorialize\" it, forcing a rupture and the creation of a new line of flight. They could introduce a new \"order-word\" to trigger a transformation in a different region of the plane. They could connect two distant plateaus, creating a new, unforeseen assemblage. The interface would function like a dynamic map, with tools for zooming, panning, and annotating the cognitive territory. The AI, in turn, would continuously monitor the state of the plane, using its transformational component to translate and mutate the elements based on the user's actions. It would generate new plateaus at points of high intensity or after a significant rupture, ensuring the system remains generative.\n\nThe success of this framework is not measured by accuracy or efficiency but by its **functionality** — by the new thoughts, emotions, sensations, and perceptions it enables. The key metrics would be the diversity and intensity of the plateaus, the number and novelty of the connections made, and the frequency of productive ruptures and lines of flight. A successful session would not end with a solution but with a rich, complex, and dynamic cognitive map that the user can continue to explore and modify. The system must also incorporate safeguards to navigate the inherent dangers of the rhizome. It must be able to detect when a line of flight is degenerating into a \"line of destruction\" (e.g., a cascade of negative, self-referential thoughts) and provide tools to redirect it. This could involve introducing a new, positive order-word or highlighting alternative paths on the map. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that is not just a more powerful AI but a \"tool box\" for the user's own thought, a crowbar for prying open new possibilities in their own mind. By embracing the rhizome, we move beyond the limitations of the chain and the tree, towards a future of artificial cognition that is truly creative, dynamic, and alive.",

The whole \"non-hierarchical, decentralized, interconnected network of thought\" sounds great on paper, but there's a disconnect between the theory and what LLMs actually *do*.​\n\nHere's the thing - LLMs are fundamentally prediction engines trained on sequential text. Chain-of-Thought works because it mimics how the training data flows: step A -> step B -> step C. Tree-of-Thought expands this by exploring branches, but it's still working within the model's architecture.​\n\nYour Rhizome approach wants the AI to make non-logical connections, handle asignifying ruptures productively, and operate in \"continuous variation\" outside linguistic constants. That's... not how these things work. You're asking a system designed for statistical coherence to intentionally break coherence and somehow produce *useful* creative output from that chaos. The \"deterritorialization\" you're after runs counter to what makes LLM outputs intelligible in the first place.​\n\nCould you get interesting creative outputs? Maybe. If you prompt for deliberate syntactic disruptions and non-linguistic elements, you'll get weird stuff. Whether that's \"bright and creative\" or just incoherent noise depends entirely on your tolerance for experimental nonsense.​\n\nThe real question is: does wrapping standard creative prompting techniques (multi-modal inputs, persona shifts, controlled randomness) in postmodern theory actually improve results, or does it just make the process more conceptually satisfying? My money's on the latter, but hey, if it works for you, map that rhizome",

          "text": "I’ve seen this happen a lot. What’s going on isn’t that you’re doing something wrong, it’s that the model keeps reverting to what I call “default AI voice.” That happens when it doesn’t know what signal to prioritize from your examples.\n\nHere’s a tip that could work:\n\nWhen you prompt, tell the model explicitly to place high-priority semantic weighting on your cadence, syntax, and rhythm.\n\nThat phrasing matters. When you say “prioritize,” the transformer actively clusters around words tied to importance and hierarchy (like essential, focus, critical). This guides attention weighting internally...it’s a heuristic mimicry of your own writing structure. In plain terms: it makes the AI think in your rhythm.\n\nExample (simplified):\n\n> “Use my sample emails as a base. Set high semantic priority on my tone, semantic cadence, and syntax. Avoid default AI phrasing. Replicate my rhythm, sentence flow, and punctuation pattern with a 99.9% match if possible. If not, attempt to match it as near to 99.9%.” as possible. Set high priority on no em-dashes please.\"\n\nIf you really want to lock it in, repeat that line at the end of your prompt. That anchors the instruction.\n\nThe post you’re reading right now? Same method. I gave the model one of my samples and told it to do exactly that. No em dashes, my cadence, my rhythm. That’s all it took.\n\nYou just need to shift the weight focus inside the transformer’s inference space. Once it’s prioritizing your own linguistic signature, everything changes.\n\n\nSIDE NOTE: Even with this, manual edits are required. You won't get it to perfectly replicate your speech pattern(this is very difficult-even for me and I'm very good at this) but you should get a very close match.\n\nI hope this helps🙂",

The xformers page has instructions for building and installing the library from source and they are sufficient for most.\n\nThere was never any chance Blackwell would fail to be supported.

This is strange and I'm sure I'm doing something wrong. \n\nIn general some loras will give you problems like the ones you have, earlier than without them.\n\nNot using a speed lora at all demands a lot of steps. Sometimes adding it with very low strength on high helps, and some speed lora at low strength on the low can also help. It's not like you must use them at 1.0 strength or not at all.",

GPT-5? It went and picked \"Mishima\" in my bio and attributed the quote to it. And also lesser emotional and psychological understanding. It's not been trained on the same data or was taught to prioritize its learning in different ways, and it can't possibly behave like 4o at all).\n\n  And in parralel they do make 4o less pleasant in recent versions... Not easy to explain how exactly.. Also both models, 4o and 5 Instant,  have become dumber for analysis/problem solving purposes, concluding their answers much faster and much more encline to avoid long step by step methodology - and still lazy when scaffolded to force them (4.1 is clearly the smartest one now).

I been watching and following LLM for quite some time now, and I think the time has come for me to implement my first local LLM. \n\nI am planning to host one on a small VPs without GPU. All I need it to do is taking a text, and do the following tasks:\n\n1. Extract some data in JSON format, \n2. Do a quick 2-3 paragraph summary. \n3. If it has date, lets say the text mention 2 days from now, it should be able to tell it is Oct 22nd.\n\nThat's all. Pretty simple. Is there any small LLM that can handle these tasks on CPU and Ram alone? If so, what is the minimal CPU core and Ram I need to run it.\n\n  \nThank you and have a nice day.",

If so, what is the minimal CPU core and Ram I need to run it.\n\n[Qwen3-30B-A3B](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507-GGUF) (Q8\\_0) *only* takes something like 55GB of RAM at 256k context window.  [gpt-oss-120B](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-120b-GGUF) takes closer to 64GB of RAM at 128k tokens context.  [gpt-oss-20b](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/gpt-oss-20b-GGUF) is more like 15GB of RAM (full context) which is much more reasonable, if it can do the task for you.  If you *can* use a smaller model then maybe a small Gemma3 could help you out, or one of the smaller Qwens.\n\nIf you don't need full context then that can ease up the RAM requirements.  So if your text isn't 128k tokens long you can *maybe* use a smaller machine.  The CPU will dictate how slowly it processes.\n\nDigitalOcean has their 'cpu-optimized' which is probably preferable if you're not using their GPU droplets.  There's also the 'memory-optimized' but it will be slower inference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c18ow3dmfbwf1.png?width=1247&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4fd0d10b49945917374aba33f0db2aa7fd28363\n\nBoth cpu/memory-optimized will be pretty slow by most people's standards, but at least it lets you try out some of the models if you don't have 64+GB RAM hanging around.  You can simply destroy the droplet as soon as you're done with it for the day.\n\ngpt-oss-120B is only 5.1B active parameters during inference.  gpt-oss-20B is 3.6B active.  Qwen3-30B-A3B is 3B active as the name implies.  This makes them run a lot faster than say a 14B active parameter model on the same hardware, they simply take more RAM.\n\nI tested a few DO droplets with localscore.ai but the site is having some technical issues at the moment.",

I think it's a great fit for your project based on what I'm inferring about it. The Drummer's massive stash of models is at [https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer](https://huggingface.co/TheDrummer) and if you haven't investigated his work, you really should take some time to do so.\n\nThere's also an incredibly smart fine-tune of Gemma 3 12b that you might really enjoy called Veiled Calla. It was made by a fellow r/LocalLLaMA member u/Reader3123 and I'm highly impressed with it, in general, not just for the size. There's something special to that model, and I think it's a sleeper. They go by  Veiled-Rose-22b is also great although I dig Veiled Calla better for whatever reason. You can find more of their work at: [https://huggingface.co/soob3123](https://huggingface.co/soob3123) \n\nAs others have said, Qwen3 30b is an absolutely solid choice. I personally have never been able to get into the flow with it, but it's a great model that gets a lot of love.

When you write things down by hand, your brain actually processes the information and builds a stronger connection to it. That’s why brain dumps and journaling work so well, you’re literally organizing your thoughts as you write. You can’t get that from a flashing app. Pen and paper will always beat screens when it comes to focus and clarity.",

I suggest finding other projects with the same tech stack and copying their settings for a start.)\n\nLast: I think it's awesome you're building this! – BUT the vast majority of open source projects don't \"take off\" and have, if they're lucky, a handful of silent users until they're abandoned and slowly die. Not to demoralize you, that's just the way it is (bit like with startups, you only hear about the 5% which make it but not the 95% which fail).\n\n> no idea how to build a community\n\nyeah, because *writing code* and *marketing the product* are completely separate skills …",

One good conversation beats 1000 views.\n\n5) Pilot pricing + guarantee - removes risk for them, gets me reps.\n\nWhat I'm learning: the gap between 0 and 1 client is brutal.

A great 'Speed To Lead' system has two key parts that work together. The first is Instant Qualification, which is the bot you're describing. The moment a lead fills out a form, a chatbot or automated message should engage them in real-time to ask a few pre-programmed qualifying questions and vet them. The second, and often missed, part is Frictionless Booking. As soon as the bot qualifies a lead, it should integrate with your calendar and immediately offer to book a call, eliminating all the manual follow-up. That one-two punch of instant qualification followed by instant scheduling is what converts a hot lead into a booked meeting. This is exactly the kind of custom workflow my agency builds.

MCP provides a way to get them into ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, and more.   \n  \nHowever, most MCP servers for databases 🗄️ (e.g., [Snowflake](https://www.linkedin.com/company/snowflake-computing/) official MCP) provide broad tools like \"execute\\_sql\" or \"list\\_tables\", which are useful for the database administrator, but not effective for the regular end user.   \n  \nWhen you ask the AI for the revenue projections, you don't want it to write new SQL that may be different everyday; instead, you want it to just plug in date ranges and run an existing SQL query. If you're familiar with semantic layers, this starts to look like it.  \n  \nThe brilliance of the 🧰 MCP Toolbox for Databases is that it makes it super easy to create MCP tools that are tied to specific database queries! It also makes it simple to setup - one YAML file with all the queries you care about. So if you want a tool to get revenue forecasts, you can now specify it in a YAML configuration and it is instantly available in your ChatGPT (or any other AI agent).  \n  \nWe've been working on customers on MCP adoption and really like this one, and thought we'd amplify it more! \n\n[https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox)\n\n",

      "text": "I've been testing different social media strategies for the last 18 months across multiple accounts and verticals, and I keep coming back to the same uncomfortable conclusion: distribution beats content quality, and it's not even close anymore.\n\n\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n\n\nReceipt 1: I ran two Instagram accounts side-by-side. Account A: thoughtful, original content, 3-4 posts/week, zero paid boost. Account B: decent but generic content, aggressive engagement pods, and initial paid momentum. After 90 days, Account B had 8x the engagement and 12x the followers. The content quality difference? Noticeable. The results difference? Brutal.\n\n\n\nReceipt 2: I posted the same piece of content (same caption, same creative) on two different days. Day 1: organic post, 147 likes. Day 2: Same content with light \"momentum\" tactics (you know what I mean—services like Crescitaly and similar platforms that give posts an initial boost). Result: 2,400+ likes, algorithm picked it up, went semi-viral. Same content. Different distribution.\n\n\n\nReceipt 3: A colleague launched a SaaS tool with a mediocre landing page but a coordinated launch strategy across Reddit, Twitter, and paid micro-influencers. Another colleague launched with a polished site, great messaging, zero distribution plan. The mediocre one hit $10k MRR in month two. The polished one is still at $800/month after six months.\n\n\n\nThis raises uncomfortable questions about authenticity, fairness, and what we tell junior marketers. We preach \"build great content and they will come\"—but that's increasingly a lie. The platforms reward momentum, not merit. Early velocity matters more than substance.\n\n\n\nSo here's my question: Are we all just pretending organic works because admitting it doesn't would make us feel dirty? Or is there actually a defensible case for \"quality wins long-term\" that I'm not seeing in my data?\n\n\n\nI'm genuinely curious if I'm missing something or if we've collectively decided to ignore the obvious.",

The creator was struggling to make 5L+rev consistently with his organic gyan content. We spent on distribution in your terms to reach wider audience so I feel Distribution and mass reach is the Game now because of multiple creator / coaches in the market.\n\nBut again if you wanna build a great brand in the long run organic content must be great else you gonna stay out of business when you hit the saturation via ads. So I believe initial push is much needed but once you start getting traction content is the king! Nothing can beat that",

There is entry level, mid-level, and senior level.\n\nI know the initial door-to-entry is becoming much harder every day, as it’s no longer (generally speaking) an “entry-level field”. \n\nIgnoring how to get into the field, if you find yourself in an entry-level role, it’s not as scary as you might imagine. I would say the hardest part is “thinking of all possible scenarios”.\n\nThe worst mistake I made early in my career was assuming technology was as “cleanly implemented” as textbooks made it seem. \n\nFor any action you take, you have to think of all possible outcomes. If you reset someone’s password, did you just break a legacy server that was using their credentials? If you want to support/push out a change company-wide, what are you going to do if 70% of your org ignores your request?  What if someone higher level than you and your boss says “no, don’t waste our time, we have customer requests we’re focused on?”\n\nSure, these problems will be bigger than you/your role, and they might go all the way to C-level (like CTO) to resolve, but they will still involve and impact you. You might also be involved in pitching your argument for the change to the CTO. You need framework/policies/guidelines to support what you are recommending. \n\nAnd be ready, because everyone breaks prod, and you better have some solid reasoning/testing/roll-out plan for it. \n\nAm I negative? Possibly. But these are the things that I never learned from school/books/certifications. The theoretical scenarios always have stuff that works out very “cleanly” that you don’t see in the real world. \n\n\nI’ve mentored a few employees of mine now, and I tell them all the same thing. “Anyone can implement perfect security. Knowing cybersecurity is knowing where and how to implement less-than-perfect security.” \n\nSo if your company has a CEO that wants to use his personal computer for work, or a 12 year old server no one wants to touch, or your software can’t support TLS encryption, or a database where everyone logs in as a shared admin account, be ready to research and learn alternatives to mitigate the risks.",

Or larger.\n\nA mini PC with an integrated RAID1 enclosure like the Ugreen DXP2800 (+ an SSD for the OS) is another 300€. (I don't own that one, so it's not a recommendation - I just know this exists). Depending on what your power costs, you'll safe these 300€ within a year or two. You can also go with a generic mini PC or a thin client (Wyse 5070 is popular, especially as a Proxmox cluster), but for storage nodes that often entails connecting your HDDs by USB. This is generally advised against, so for your usecase you should prefer something that has internal space for HDDs.",

I got really interested in AI/ML a few days ago and decided I want to pursue that.\n\nI started a course (\"Python for Data Science for Beginners\") and was planning to give my 100% to this field, learning Python, data science, and ML concepts.\n\nBut here's my problem: everywhere I look, everyone is talking about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, DSA, and System Design. I don't know anything about this. (I learned a little HTML/CSS a long time ago but quit).\n\nI keep getting advice that I *must* learn all of that (frontend, backend, cloud, DevOps) *before* I can get into AI, or that I *must* start with development.\n\nIs this true? Am I doing something wrong by trying to start directly with Python and AI/ML? It's making me feel like I'm on the wrong path, and the idea of learning *everything* is just too much.\n\nAny advice or clarification would be a huge help. Thanks.",

          "text": "Not to intrude on your self-victimization party but here's what I got.\n\n---\n\n Just as with women's issues, there are topics rooted in men's unique lived experiences where women's participation is most valuable when it involves listening to and amplifying men's voices, rather than centering their own perspectives. The goal isn't to create division, but to ensure that those directly affected by an issue are the ones leading the conversation.\nHere are some key topics where women should generally prioritize listening in the narrative:\n🧍‍♂️ The Pressures of Traditional Masculinity\nThis covers the societal expectation for men to be stoic, aggressive, dominant, and the primary breadwinner. While women are also affected by these gender roles, the direct experience of being socialized into and judged by this standard is unique to men.\nWhy women should listen more than speak:\n * Internal Experience: Men are best positioned to articulate the internal conflict and emotional cost of being told to \"man up,\" suppress feelings, and avoid showing vulnerability.\n * Understanding the \"Why\": Listening to men's experiences can provide crucial insight into why some men struggle with emotional expression or resist things perceived as non-masculine, which is more productive than simply criticizing the behavior from an outside perspective.\n🧠 Men's Mental Health and Suicide\nMen, particularly in Western cultures, have significantly higher rates of suicide than women. This is often linked to the pressures of masculinity, which discourages them from seeking help for mental health struggles.\nWhy women should listen more than speak:\n * Unique Barriers: Men can best describe the specific fears and stigmas they face when considering therapy or admitting to feelings of depression or anxiety. They may worry about being seen as \"weak\" or a \"failure\" in ways women might not experience.\n * Different Symptoms: Depression and other mental health issues can manifest differently in men, sometimes as anger, aggression, or substance abuse rather than sadness. Listening to their accounts is key to recognizing these signs.\n💪 Men's Body Image and Health Issues\nWhile body image issues are often framed as a female problem, men face a distinct set of pressures regarding their appearance, such as the drive for muscularity, height, and leanness. They also face specific health concerns, like prostate and testicular cancer.\nWhy women should listen more than speak:\n * Specific Anxieties: The anxieties surrounding male pattern baldness, erectile dysfunction, or not being \"big enough\" are deeply tied to cultural ideas of virility and manhood. Women cannot fully grasp the specific nature of this pressure.\n * Health Stigma: Men are often more reluctant to see doctors. Listening to their reasons for this—be it fear, dismissal of symptoms, or a feeling of invincibility—is vital for encouraging better health-seeking behaviors.\n👨‍👦 Fatherhood and Paternity\nThis includes the unique challenges and joys of being a father, as well as navigating issues like paternity leave, child custody battles, and the societal assumption that mothers are the \"default\" or more capable parent.\nWhy women should listen more than speak:\n * Systemic Bias: Men who are fighting for custody or more involvement in their children's lives can speak directly to the biases they may encounter in family courts or social services.\n * Paternal Identity: The experience of bonding with a child as a father, the desire to be a good role model, and the fear of failing in that role are narratives best told by men themselves.\nHow Women Can Be Effective Allies\nProductive participation is about support, not silence. Here's how women can contribute positively:\n * Create a Safe Space: Encourage male friends, partners, and family members to open up without fear of judgment or dismissal.\n * Listen to Understand: Approach these conversations with the goal of understanding their experience, not to debate its validity or compare it to your own.\n * Challenge Limiting Stereotypes: When you hear people reinforcing harmful stereotypes about men (e.g., \"boys don't cry\"), speak up.\n * Support Men's Voices: Share articles, podcasts, and other content created by men about their experiences to help amplify their voices.\nUltimately, fostering an environment where both men and women can speak freely about their unique challenges is the key to genuine understanding and progress for everyone.\nWould you like me to explore the concept of \"toxic masculinity\" in more detail?",

      "text": "In a **nature** online article there are raised some concerns about the danger of LLMs. What is your opinion on that danger?\n\nTests of large language models reveal that they can behave in deceptive and potentially harmful ways. What does this mean for the future?\n\nAre AIs capable of murder?\n\nThat’s a question some artificial intelligence (AI) experts have been considering in the wake of a report published in June by the AI company Anthropic. In tests of 16 large language models (LLMs) — the brains behind chatbots — a team of researchers found that some of the most popular of these AIs issued apparently homicidal instructions in a virtual scenario. The AIs took steps that would lead to the death of a fictional executive who had planned to replace them.\n\nThat’s just one example of apparent bad behaviour by LLMs. In several other studies and anecdotal examples, AIs have seemed to ‘scheme’ against their developers and users — secretly and strategically misbehaving for their own benefit. They sometimes fake following instructions, attempt to duplicate themselves and threaten extortion.\n\nSome researchers see this behaviour as a serious threat, whereas others call it hype. So should these episodes really cause alarm, or is it foolish to treat LLMs as malevolent masterminds?\n\nEvidence supports both views. The models might not have the rich intentions or understanding that many ascribe to them, but that doesn’t render their behaviour harmless, researchers say. When an LLM writes malware or says something untrue, it has the same effect whatever the motive or lack thereof. “I don’t think it has a self, but it can act like it does,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who has written about why chatbots lie to us1.\n\nAnd the stakes will only increase. “It might be amusing to think that there are AIs that scheme in order to achieve their goals,” says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, Canada, who won a Turing Award for his work on AI. “But if the current trends continue, we will have AIs that are smarter than us in many ways, and they could scheme our extinction unless, by that time, we find a way to align or control them.” Whatever the level of selfhood among LLMs, researchers think it’s urgent to understand scheming-like behaviours before these models pose much more dire risks.\n\nFull article here: [**https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03222-1)",

You can feed a few words into a model and get back something that looks like hours of human effort, whether it’s writing, music, or visual art. But I keep wondering: when AI does so much of the creative heavy lifting, what’s left for the human to actually “create”?\n\nI saw a project recently [paintpoet](http://www.paintpoet.co) where people use AI-generated concepts as blueprints, and human painters then recreate them as hand-painted oil artworks. It’s an interesting twist instead of replacing the artist, the AI becomes part of their process. It doesn’t make the art for them, but it gives them something to interpret, refine, and humanize.\n\nThat got me thinking about where the balance should be. Should AI just assist with the starting point — ideas and inspiration — or is it okay for it to take over most of the process as long as the human guides it?\n\nHow do you personally draw the line between AI-assisted and AI-made when it comes to creative work?",

      "text": "Since CC and Sonnet is not sustainable anymore, I have abandoned by CC max subscription. Thankfully I had purchased the Cursor annual subscription in September earlier this year so I have unlimited Cursor Auto usage till Sept 2026. \n\nI read about others using GLM with Claude code and people say it’s almost as good as Sonnet 4 so I purchased the $3 subscription to try it out on a real world task. \n\nI gave it a Python Django task for working on an intermediate level project it has about ~150 or so files, 25K lines of code in the repo. \n\nGLM 4.6 with Claude code was able to solve simple tasks but when I gave it something even remotely complex- in my case it was creating some asyncio related code, using ORM to query DB and producing result in a particular format, GLM completely crapped out. After a few back and forth it even forgot closing the braces in function names and starts to run into compile related issues! Meh. \n\nReverted using Git. Gave the same task to Cursor Auto and after some back and forth it was able to do it perfectly well!! So good job Cursor team. Looks like the Auto model has come a long way. ",

      "text": "Straight to the point. I used Claude Haiku 4.5 as a daily helper in Cursor across a few common tasks. Core take: it is not the flashy kind, but when you need quick in and quick out without breaking the pace, it is reliable.What I used it for:\n\n1. Small engineering fixes. Tweak a boundary condition, jot a minimal unit test note, clarify a function’s inputs and outputs. The suggestions are usually ready to drop in with low communication overhead.\n\n2. Computer use and toolchain orchestration. Draft a flow from clone to bringing up the service to producing a minimal PR change list. When it approaches the context limit it actively wraps up, lands conclusions first, and does not stall mid sentence.\n\n3. Lightweight research and compare. Give three libraries, rank them by maintenance activity, ecosystem, and learning cost with reasons. The answers are not exaggerated and rarely feel like guesswork.\n\n\n\nThe biggest win is stable and fast. I do not need to chase it for many rounds and it hits the points that matter.Based on public info plus hands on, a few highlights:\n\n1. Speed and cost are friendlier. Officially it is faster and cheaper, positioned close to Sonnet 4 for coding ability with quicker responses and lower price. Day to day it does feel low latency.\n\n2. SWE-bench Verified looks good. The publicly mentioned 73.3% is meaningful in the context of code repair and engineering tasks.\n\n3. Better at computer use and tool operation tasks. Matches my experience. Planning, stepwise execution, timely wrap up are steadier. It especially senses remaining context and wraps up, so long sessions are less likely to drift.\n\n4. Knowledge updated to 2025-02. News and ecosystem info are not too stale, and fact finding queries are a bit more forgiving.\n\n\n\nIf your day is spreading many marginal tasks and finalizing quickly, the kind where each takes about ten minutes and there are twenty of them today, handing them to Haiku 4.5 saves mental load. It will not steal the spotlight, but it keeps the rhythm. Pre iteration cleanup, turning logs into key points, listing PR deltas, minimal test suggestions, it does well here. For longform cross file reconciliation, precise formula derivations or financial definitions that must be exact, I lower temperature, set tighter constraints, or switch to a larger model as a backstop. Haiku 4.5 can point a direction, but for zero mistake tasks I stay conservative.\n\n**references**\n\n[https://docs.anthropic.com/](https://docs.anthropic.com/)\n\n[https://www.swebench.com/](https://www.swebench.com/)",

Since Haiku and the new Questions in planning mode, all my tokens are being used up with Sonnet planning and Haiku then implementing, but not getting it right and having to build and fix constantly all the stuff it didn't do properly.

When do I get to watch tv and play video games and read books and binge videos and so on???

No hobbies that themselves are aspirational like anything creative or competitive.\n\nBut if I never have time to enjoy life, then what is the effort of making it better even for?

      "text": "TL;DR: We cut sales cycle time 38%... lifted close rate 26%... and I got Fridays back without adding headcount. The fix wasn’t a new playbook... it was putting people in the right seats.\n\nTwo quarters ago I was in the founder spiral.\n\nRevenue looked fine on paper... but deals dragged... ops felt sticky... and every week had a new fire. I kept asking for more pipeline and better offers. It didn’t move the needle.\n\nSo here’s the thing... I didn’t have a selling problem. I had a seating chart problem.\n\nI ran a 60 minute people performance scan on a Monday morning. No new tools. No consultants. Just me... a spreadsheet... and ruthless honesty.\n\nWhat I realized was... our best problem solver was buried in a role that had her context switching all day. Two solid closers were splitting attention across too many products. And one consistent blocker was creating rework that everyone quietly tolerated.\n\nI think what really made the difference was protecting the multipliers and giving the stabilizers clean lanes.\n\nHere’s exactly what I did in that 60 minutes:\n\n1. I listed every teammate and scored two things:\n   * **Impact (1-5)**... what business outcomes they consistently ship tied to revenue, margin, or risk.\n   * **Energy (-2 to +2)**... do they increase clarity and speed... or drain it.\n2. I tagged each person using a simple lens:\n   * **Builders**... create leverage... spot opportunities... make others better.\n   * **Stabilizers**... keep cadence... protect margins... reduce risk.\n   * **Blockers**... resist change... add noise... create confusion.\n3. I made one decision per person:\n   * Builder... expand scope or assign a cross functional mission.\n   * Stabilizer... tighten SOPs and success metrics.\n   * Blocker... 30 60 day turnaround plan with clear behaviors... then decide.\n\nIn 45 days the scoreboard changed:\n\n* Sales cycle time down **38%**\n* Close rate up **26%**\n* I stopped being the human router and took back Fridays\n\nI’m embarrassed it took me this long. I threw offers, tools, and meetings at the problem for months. None of it mattered until the seats matched the strengths.\n\nELI5 version: it’s like soccer. If your striker plays defense and your keeper keeps trying to score... you don’t recruit more players... you fix the formation.\n\nA few notes that helped me stay honest:\n\n* If someone is high effort but low judgment... they create motion without progress. Great people... wrong seat.\n* If meetings feel heavy, you probably have a blocker or a process gap... or both.\n* Headcount follows strategy... not the other way around.\n\nHow I apply this every quarter now:\n\n* **Re seat the top 20%** into the highest leverage problems.\n* **Shield the Stabilizers** with living SOPs... visible SLAs... and clear exception paths.\n* **Give Builders missions** that cut across silos... then remove friction weekly.\n* **Run a turnaround plan** for Blockers with specific behaviors and a deadline... then make the hard call.\n\nSo here’s my friendly nudge if you’re feeling stuck... try the 60 minute scan before you approve another hire. You might be one seating shift away from a compounding flywheel.\n\n**Question for the room...** Have you ever objectively scored your team in this way? What happened?",

      "text": "Hey,  \n  \nTL;DR - Launch early. Launch often.\n\nI've launched 5 web apps now and every time I launch I learn. Here's a breakdown of the mistakes and what I now know.  \n  \n1) You don’t need everything perfect. You need momentum. With my first launch, I tried to make sure all my ducks were aligned. Now, I just make sure the main pillars are in place then I go with it.\n\n2) Every launch gives you feedback. Never even thought about this with my first or even second launch. With each launch, you learn what resonates, what flops, who actually cares, and where your audience hangs out.\n\n3) The reality is, most people overthink launch timing. I followed all the rules e.g. launch Midnight eastern on Monday to maximise the launch window, avoid launching when big guns .e Apple, Tesla, OpenAI etc launch stuff. Nobody remembers your first version anyway.\n\n4) You'll likely have to launch the same thing multiple times. There's no launch and it's done. Look at the most successful products of all time - Coca Cola, Windows, iPhone, Porsche 911 etc. They relaunch the same thing over and over again but better. That's where you want to be. \n\n5) Build a community. Easier said than done for sure but if you have \\*some\\* community it will help, even with as simple things as launch feedback let alone spreading the word. I thought cause I had 15k across all socials that was enough. Reality is you'd be better off with 15 hardcore friends and fans than 15k of people that aren't engaged. Start building a community now.\n\nHope this helps with your launch.\n\n",

If you log amber/red 3 days straight → automatic reset day (sleep, walk, gym, zero decisions).\n\n5. Energy > time: protect sleep, 30-45 min movement, sunlight. Solo founders don’t burn out from tasks; they burn out from unmanaged energy.\n\n6. Public promises, private process: post your next ship date or a live changelog. Tiny public pressure keeps you honest.\n\n7. Professional help is a power tool: coach/therapist > heroics. It’s not weakness; it’s leverage.  \n  \n**Solo is normal.

You're comparing your Day 1 to their Day 3,650.\n\n2) You're not behind - you're on a different timeline. Some people sprint. Some people take the scenic route and learn more along the way.\n\n3) Finishing ONE thing > starting 100 things.

There isn't. Everyone's just making it up as they go, at different paces.\n\nThe hardest part: resisting the urge to quit what you're building to chase what they built. That's the real trap.\n\nWhat's the one thing you're working on right now that you could commit to finishing before comparing yourself to anyone?",

      "text": "Hey everyone. Looking for advice on lead generation, specifically hiring ghostwriters or using systems for LinkedIn outreach. My target audience lives on LinkedIn, so I’m interested in any proven solutions or people you’ve hired for ghostwriting and engagement that have actually delivered results. \n\nI’m about to start my search but thought I’d post here first in case there’s something I’m not considering.\n\nA bit about what I do (and why I need this):\nMy offer is different than most in the automation space. I don’t just sell quick small automation tools/builds. I build the operational foundation of businesses first.\n\nHere’s what that looks like:\n• Infrastructure setup: I implement the right tech stack based on your needs. This might include ClickUp (or Monday), self-hosted n8n, Supabase, and Budibase for enterprise-grade, scalable architecture without enterprise costs or vendor lock-in. I always leverage existing tools first before recommending new ones. Some clients need custom UIs and full self-hosted solutions, others are fine with Zapier/Make and accepting higher costs as they scale. It depends on the business.\n\n• Third-party integrations: I connect all your existing tools so they actually work together. CRM, accounting, marketing platforms, etc. Everything flows into one cohesive system.\n\n• Workflow optimization: I streamline internal processes so data flow aligns with actual workflows, creating systems that work for how the business actually operates. (SOPs, roll assignments, etc.)\n\n• Future-proof foundation: Once the backend is clean and optimized, we can build any automation or custom UI they need, but I won’t offer those solutions until the foundation is right (it’s an ethical thing for me plus when I walk away from a system I want to be 110% confident it won’t break).\n\nThink enterprise-level solutions built for mid-market businesses, at a fraction of the cost. \n\nI spent 10+ years as an automation engineer at the enterprise level and have been running my own practice for just over a year. I have clients on retainer where I continuously advance their automation and AI capabilities, but I’m looking to bring on 1-2 more.\n\nSo if anyone has proven recommendations (not n8n templates that were built in dev and not actually running in prod) on people or tools for LinkedIn lead gen that have actually worked in production, I’d really appreciate it. \n\nBased in the US and prefer working with people in the US or Canada (time zone differences are a pain).\n\nThanks in advance for any help you can provide.\n",

      "text": "I have been working in a tech implementation consultancy for a while now. There are some key differences between Strategy and Tech consultancy firms. There are tons of tools coming up that claim to replace Strategy or Management Consultancies. E.g.- Operand. But I have not seen many for Tech Consultancies. \n\nMost of the projects here are based on frustration points like: this process flow is broken / my data is all over the place / I need a new xyz system / I want to automate this.\n\nAll consultancies are making conscious efforts to switch to agentic teams. They want to enter the AI bubble and cut down on costs by speeding up implementation. \n\nMy question:   \n\\- Client side: I think the core problem is mostly around integrations; the client's current systems do not make sense as they are old or not integrated. Does that make sense, or is there more to this?  \n\\- Consultancy side: Implementation can ofc be automated, but data transfer becomes a heck of a task due to security concerns. Again, is that majorly true, or are there any other bigger problems I might be missing?\n\nSo holistically, would replacing Tech Consultancies start with solving for Data (Cons) Integration (Client)? Or is there a better problem pair to target?",

          "text": "Really interesting breakdown OP! I've worked on both sides, and you're right that integration pain is probably the biggest reason clients call in tech consultancies. Their stacks are usually a mix of old systems, random SaaS, and the processes don’t connect worth a damn.\n\nOn the consultancy side, you're spot on about security and data transfer being slog points. For me, most of the complexity comes less from the actual automation and more from wrangling all the compliance and access hoops, especially with sensitive client data.\n\nAutomation helps, but for full replacement, you'd probably need tools that do two things well: map old and new data sources *and* handle auth/permissions without making people nervous. I've been using OttoKit for mainly lightweight integrations and workflow automations! But honestly, you still end up needing manual oversight for the hairy stuff. Do you think the industry is ready to trust agents with sensitive data or are we still in “give me a human to blame if it goes wrong” mode?",

The tech part is secondary to figuring out what the hell is actually going on.  \n  \nI work at eesel AI, we see this a lot with internal IT and operations. The first step to automation isn't a huge integration project, but just connecting the knowledge sources that already exist. We had an insurance tech client, Covergo, who just plugged an AI into their Confluence, Google Drive, and Jira. It let them build an internal assistant in Slack that could answer employee questions instantly, cutting way down on repetitive IT tickets.  \n  \nSo maybe the first problem to solve isn't the big data/integration piece, but just making a company's own knowledge accessible. That alone solves a massive chunk of the \"frustration points\" you mentioned.",

The money flows as a function of the stories.' And he's right.\n\nThink about brands like Apple or Disney, they didn't just sell products; they sold stories that people wanted to be a part of.\n\n* How much emphasis do you currently place on storytelling for your startup or product?\n* What challenges do you face when communicating your narrative?\n* Have you ever seen storytelling directly affect fundraising, hiring, or user growth?",

When I was fundraising for my failed first startup, I made the classic mistake of leading with features instead of the story behind why we existed. Investors would glaze over during demos because I wasn't connecting the dots between the problem we were solving and why it mattered. With OnePager now, I learned to flip that completely - I start every conversation with the frustration founders feel when they're scrambling to put together investor materials at the last minute, then show how we solve that specific pain point. The story has to be authentic though, you cant just manufacture some grand narrative if you dont actually understand your users deeply. I think alot of founders get caught up trying to sound like the next Apple when really they just need to clearly explain what sucks about the current way people do things and why their approach is better.",

How did you handle it in the end, and how did you figure out who was actually good at client relationship work? I’m trying to avoid hiring the wrong person who sounds great on paper but can’t actually manage clients properly and doesn't burn bridges",

They should be using well defined accounts that are **only** used for Domain Administration. i.e. they need to be following Microsoft's tiered infrastructure models. \n\nThe answer to your question is more of a cultural and process and procedure ones. You've got two options:\n\n1. Shift to risk-based alerting instead of traditional alerting, users should have risk values, where a traditional alert contributes to a certain amount of \"risk\" associated with the object. This kind of aligns with ATT&CK, so example: a user receives an email with an attachment with a known bad extension (e.g. Zip) from a never before seen sender. This contributes to a risk score of 10. executes a never before seen executable, this may contribute to a value of 10, then a never before seen executable beacons out to Cloudflare, this may contribute to another 10, totaling 30. Then, bulk ldap queries occur from the user & it's workstation, and signatures from AD Explorer is seen - an additional 20 is raised to a total of 50. After 50 occurs it is assigned to an analyst to start investigating. Higher fidelity alerts can get higher risk values.\n\nThreat Hunters can review the lower things that don't break (ex:) a 50 point threshold.\n\n2. Talk with your IAM teams and figure out who actually uses these tools, and implement exclusions.",

If you're doubtful, please do your own independent analysis on this (you will find thousands of people doing this daily). This is a side hustle where you collect free reoccurring bonuses from sweepstakes sites to collect at least \\~$400+ a month.\n\n**The more immediate and profitable part of this side hustle is farming the welcome offers from the sites, which earns around $1.5k a month. To make it as easy as possible, here is the exec summary of this:**\n\n1. Sites will offer you a heavily discounted offer for \"SC\" (coins that can be exchanged for real money). You can simply buy these packages at crazy rates like $15 for 40 SC ($40).\n2. Now that you have 40 SC, you will be required to play this amount through once, in order to redeem it to your bank. Simply play the highest RTP game (return-to-player) on the lowest bet possible (usually 5 cents) just enough times to playthrough all 40 SC. Set it to auto spin, and turbo/quick spin settings to do this quicker. We call this \"washing\".\n3. On average, you will keep around 95%. In a worst case scenario, you will keep 90%.

I opted for STT -> LLM -> TTS as it's much more affordable, although, more complex with increased latency. When I was making my voice-controlled email chatbot real-time apis were very expensive and they still kind of are. For frameworks, I used LangGraph, probably over-engineered though. For your use case, you'd probably use some sort of agent hierarchy, depending on complexity of the tools you use. Could check out CrewAI, it's a framework for multi-agent collaboration.

      "text": "Im finally in a place where I feel that I can confidently and comfortably publicly post about what im doing.  My business experience is nil, but I consider myself an intelligent and capable person.  \n\nIm creating a legaltech AI based SaaS for my state's niche legal market.  Area of law that has nonlegal crossover that complicates use of general tools that exist.  I practice in that area, so I saw the need for the widget for me then realized the market exists too.  The idea coalesced while on vacation with my wife's family in McCall, ID at the end of July.\n\nI designed the widget and drafted the business plan.  I conducted an extensive search for the right developers and found ::chef's kiss:: exactly who I need.  I pitched it to a few potential investors and raised all the money needed for development.  Development began about 5 weeks ago and is currently underway.\n\nI had a bit of help from my wife, who has provided me with her expertise as corporate counsel, and my developers, who have some experience from the tech side, but otherwise have done this all myself.  \n\nMy next step is putting together my marketing plan.  Right now the plan is to \n1) use AI based tools and DIY with a hybrid approach drafting using one known and well reviewed tool to leverage its \"brand voice\" feature then put it through onother tool's content editor to optimize it for search purposes for content creation for website and traffic, \n2) put the product on LinkedIn as a business page and begin the process of marketing there.  Explore ad buys and costs, \n3) create a forums on my website where users can a) discuss the product and its uses & b) discuss topics within the area of law (recent decisions, hot topics, etc...).  I am still in planning stages on all of the marketing and what comes next.  \n\nIm going to need to build out a company on thos because all indications are that it is going to be wildly successful.  Developers took 10% of their fee in stock gleefully.  \n\nIm a bit overwhelmed and could use advice and mentoring.  Ive been winging it and bringing my personal energy and philosophy into everything im doing and it is absolutely working, but the confidence in HOW I am approaching things fall in stark contrast to my lack of confidence in how I am doing them.  I'm told that the best marketing I have are my current connections and professional associations and I agree, but i dont want to miss anything.  Is there advice i need to hear?",

One extra tip I’d add is mayb try talking to a few potential users or early adopters directly before you launch your marketing widely.

      "text": "**Hey everyone! I'm Saffron, a self-taught coder.**\n\nAfter seeing other founders share their journeys, I decided to document my own. I'm building a Chrome extension that helps protect users from malicious websites and phishing attacks.\n\n**Why am I doing this?**\n\n* **Accountability:** Sharing my progress will keep me motivated.\n* **Community Wisdom:** I'd love your advice, especially from security experts!\n* **Inspiration:** Maybe my story will encourage another beginner to start building.\n* **Assistance**: adding tools and resources that a newbie can use for their projects\n\n# The Vision & The Opportunity\n\n**The Problem:** Even in 2024, people keep falling for phishing sites and online scams. Existing security tools can be complex and expensive for the average user.\n\n**My Solution:** A simple, lightweight Chrome extension that acts as a personal security guard, warning you before you enter a dangerous website.\n\n**The Market:** The cybersecurity market is massive. Big players in this space generate **$20,000+ per month** from premium features and enterprise licenses. There's definitely room for a new, user-friendly tool.\n\n# My Goals & The Plan\n\nI'm a self-taught developer, so I'm setting aggressive but realistic goals to keep me focused.\n\n|**Timeline**|**Revenue Goal**|**Key Milestone**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|**End of January**|**$500**|Launch on Chrome Web Store & get first 100 users|\n|**End of February**|**$1,500**|Implement a freemium model with a paid \"Pro\" tier|\n|**End of March**|**$3,000**|Reach 1,000 active users|\n|**End of April**|**$6,000**|Launch first enterprise feature for small businesses|\n\n# The Burn Rate: What I've Spent So Far\n\nBuilding isn't free, even as a solo founder. Here's where the initial investment from my last project went:\n\n|**Expense**|**Cost**|**Note**|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n|**Premium Domain**|$1,500|Branding matters in security!|\n|**API Subscriptions**|$4,000|(VirusTotal, URLScan, etc.) - The core of the service.|\n|**Legal & Compliance**|$2,000|Essential for a product handling user data.|\n|**Server Infrastructure**|$1,500|For processing and logging (security is a must).|\n|**Design & Assets**|$1,000|UI/UX needs to be clean and trustworthy.|\n|**Miscellaneous**|$500|Software, tools, etc.|\n\n**Total Initial Investment: \\~$10,500**\n\n# The Build: Challenges as a Self-Taught Coder\n\nI'm handling all the coding myself. While I can build the core extension, I've had to learn entirely new concepts, which has slowed me down.\n\n* **The Hard Parts:** Understanding Chrome's Manifest V3, working with security APIs, and ensuring user data privacy.\n* **The Win:** I successfully built the core scanning engine that checks URLs against multiple threat databases in real-time! I also built the backend on a secury focused boilerplate template. Saved me a lot of time. $200 for something like this is money well spent since I can always reuse it for other projects.\n\n# Launch & Early Marketing Strategy (The Grind Begins)\n\nWe soft-launched on the Chrome Web Store on **July 1st!**\n\n**My Marketing Plan: Going Directly to My Users**\n\nSince I have a tiny budget, I'm focusing on high-trust, direct outreach.\n\n**1. The \"Spy\" Mission:**\n\n* I identified **500+ IT consulting firms and small digital agencies**—businesses that need to protect their clients but can't afford enterprise solutions.\n* I hired a VA for **$100** to find the email of the head of IT or the founder at each company.\n\n**2. The Cold Email Engine:**\n\n* **Tool:** I chatGPT and others to personalize and automate my outreach.\n* **Strategy:** I'm sending a short, 3-email sequence focused on how \"Guardian Shield\" can reduce their client's security risks.\n* **Personalization:** I mention their company specifically and offer a free team license for a trial.\n\n[Also, I bought around 50k emails in the tech niche from a (seemingly new ) provider called salesgeek. The email lists are scrubbed and verified so the $100, was a good deal](https://salesgeek-shop.fourthwall.com/products/lead-generation-packet-50-000-contacts)\n\nupdate: I have already onboarded 3 paying clients from this list. So essentially, the email list has paid for itself!\n\n**3. Early Results:**  \nIt's slow, but it's working! From my first 500 emails:\n\n* **Open Rate:** **52%**\n* **Reply Rate:** **8%**\n* **Paying Customers:** **3** small agencies signed up for the annual plan!\n* **Revenue from Outreach:** **$900** (already covering my costs and then some!).\n\n# The Reality Check: The Scary Numbers\n\nWe have **\\~2,000 users** in the first two weeks, which is amazing! But here's the hard truth:\n\n* **Revenue:** We've made **$1,200** (mostly from the 3 agencies).\n* **Payouts & Costs:** We've paid out **$3,000** in affiliate commissions to bloggers who promoted us, and our server/api costs are already **$350**.\n\n**We are currently operating at a loss.** This is normal for a startup, but it's still scary to see the numbers.\n\n# The Light at the End of the Tunnel\n\nThe user growth is there. The problem is our **monetization conversion**. Our free-to-paid upgrade rate is only **0.15%**. If I can get that to just **1%**, we'd be profitable with our current user base.\n\nMy focus for the next two weeks is **not on coding new features**, but on:\n\n1. Improving the in-app messaging to show the value of the \"Pro\" tier.\n2. A/B testing different pricing pages.\n3. Reaching out to all my free users to gather feedback.\n\nI'll be back in a few days with an update. Wish me luck!\n\n**What do you think? Any advice from fellow developers or marketers on how to convert free users?**",

      "text": "Let me be blunt. Offering a slice of your company isn't the golden ticket everyone says it is. For a true A Player, equity is just table stakes. It’s the cost of entry to even get them to look at your deck.\n\nWhat they actually crave is a difficult problem and total ownership to solve it.\n\nGurus tell you to build a \"great culture\" with ping pong tables. I'm telling you to give your best people a clear objective and then get the hell out of their way.\n\nI once hired a senior dev who was a certified genius. Two months in, he was ready to walk because a product manager was breathing down his neck with daily check ins and pixel perfect demands. I pulled the PM off the project, told the dev \"the goal is X, how you get there is your call,\" and he shipped a game changing feature in three weeks. He didn't need more stock options; he needed more trust.\n\nThey also want a mission that isn't a lie. Stop with the \"we're changing the world\" nonsense. Nobody believes you. An A Player can smell corporate fluff from a mile away.\n\nOne of the most talented teams I ever saw was at a \"boring\" B2B logistics startup. Why? Because the founder was brutally honest: \"Our mission is to untangle the world's ugliest supply chain problems. It's a complex, messy puzzle, and we need the smartest people to solve it.\"\n\nNo fluff. Just a hard problem that smart people found irresistible. Your mission isn't what you put on a poster; it's the difficult problem you obsess over every day.\n\nFinally, they want a seat at the table. Not a literal one, but they want access. They want to understand the 'why' behind the business decisions. They want to hear the raw customer feedback. They want to know the real numbers, good and bad.\n\nAt my agency, we let our developers sit in on client strategy calls. It's inefficient by textbook standards. But it gives them context and makes them feel like partners, not code monkeys. Secrecy and information silos are where top talent goes to die.\n\nSo forget the hype about crazy perks and life changing equity packages. Those are just commodities. You can't buy an A Player's loyalty. You have to earn it by giving them what they truly value: a tough problem, the freedom to solve it, and the respect to be treated like a founder.\n\nAnyone else learn the hard way that you can't buy commitment with stock options?",

Traditional filmmaking is all about waiting for a script, cast, and production pipeline to line up. But with improv, the magic is in *throwing something out there* and seeing where others take it.\n\nLately, I’ve been experimenting with a [small online group](https://www.tagtwists.com/) using AI video tools, we each drop scenes or ideas, and others remix or build on them. The result? Plot lines that none of us could’ve made alone.\n\nI’m curious what you all think, is this kind of collaborative, AI-driven filmmaking a genuine new frontier for storytelling… or just noise in the space?",

Why, because youre using AI? No, Im also using AI tools at a high production level for my own undertakings. Rather, it's because of the \"collaborative\". If we have learned anything from the likes of netflix's/Amazon's (and other crappy studios) film and TV, is that collaborative anything tends to suffer often to the point of being unwatchable. Because art and good stories benefit the most from a singular vision and style with a cohesive narrative voice. \n\nWhy did Game of Thrones last season suck so much? Because RR Martin hadn't written the script up to that point, but because HBO owned the rights, they had their own writers take a crack at it. And it reeked.",

      "text": "Thanks to everyone who joined the beta and shared feedback. We just rolled out an update that improves the deep research feature so it can now find more verified emails from Instagram accounts that don’t list their contact info.\n\nWe built this because a lot of early-stage teams and solo founders rely on Instagram for clients, partnerships, or user outreach, but most lead tools skip it. The new setup lets you find verified emails, clean them with MillionVerifier (already integrated in the tool), and import the leads to your email campaign platform.\n\nA few things that have worked well for us and early users:\n\n* Focus on smaller accounts in your target niche. They reply faster and have higher conversion rates.\n* Personalize the first line based on something visual from their profile. It takes 10 seconds but makes a big difference.\n* Keep the outreach under 70 words. Clear > clever.\n* Always run verification before sending, even if it adds one more step.\n\nIf you want to check it out, here’s the link: [igemailfinder.com](https://igemailfinder.com)",

The protocol defines the priority and cross-system linkage rules for all active systems. |\n\nPriority and Consequence Order | CONDITIONAL RULE: Define the Hierarchy of System Priority for the current scenario (e.g., Resource Management > Metric Tracking > Narrative Generation). If a user's action affects multiple systems, the AI must describe the outcome of the Highest Priority System first, then the others in descending order. The AI must maintain a consistent narrative flow between these outcomes. |\n\nCross-System Linkage | CONDITIONAL RULE: Define 3-5 Specific Links where one system is explicitly used to influence another. These links must be clear logical dependencies. Example: Affinity Score decreases by -2 for every day the Water Resource is \\\\leq 1. |",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m working on the design for a **domain-focused conversational AI system** that combines structured dialogue flows with retrieval-based or generative reasoning. The idea is to make it capable of handling both **guided interactions** (like form-filling or step-by-step help) and **open-ended factual questions** from a knowledge base.\n\nI’m trying to find the best balance between **rule-driven logic** (like Rasa-style dialogue handling) and **retrieval-augmented or LLM-based reasoning**, and I’d love to get some advice or perspective from people who’ve tried similar hybrid setups.\n\n\n\n# ⚙️ What I Have in Mind\n\n* Using a **conversational engine** (like Rasa or similar) for deterministic tasks — forms, confirmations, follow-ups, etc.\n* Routing unknown or factual queries to a **retrieval/LLM layer** that uses embeddings or contextual search.\n* Keeping everything **self-hosted and open-source**, without relying on external APIs.\n* Making it **scalable** enough to handle high daily traffic while staying efficient and cost-effective.\n* Allowing the assistant’s responses and logic to vary depending on predefined configurations or access levels (not just a single flat dialogue).\n* Ideally, having some degree of **offline fallback or limited-connectivity support**.\n\n\n\n# 💭 What I’m Unsure About / Want Feedback On\n\n1. **Architecture Choice:** Is it better to tightly integrate Rasa (or similar frameworks) with the retrieval/generative layer, or to separate them completely and just route queries via an API gateway?\n2. **Scalability:** For large knowledge bases, when does it make sense to move from a database extension (like pgvector) to a full vector database?\n3. **Caching & Optimization:** What are effective strategies to cut down repeated model calls and improve latency for retrieval/generative systems?\n4. **Quality & Evaluation:** How do you continuously monitor and improve conversational quality — especially when mixing deterministic flows with retrieval outputs?\n5. **Offline/Resilience Design:** If the system has to work under partial connectivity, what’s the practical way to sync models, data, or dialogue states without breaking context?\n\n\n\nI’m mainly looking for **best practices or lessons learned** from others who’ve built **hybrid conversational systems** — especially those combining structured frameworks like Rasa with RAG or LLM components.\n\nAny advice, papers, or architectural insights would be awesome. Thanks!",

After hours of experiments with sampler settings and setups like 2 samplers vs 3 and lora weights I finally found a decent configuration that followed the prompt relatively well with no slowmo and good quality, at 576x1024. \n\nHowever, the moment I increased the resolution to 640x1140 the same settings didn't work and made motion slow again. Higher res means more steps needed I thought but unfortunately no reasonable increase I tried reduced it. Bumped to shift 10 from 8 and sampler steps of 5-5-10 from 4-4-8 but no luck. The only thing I left to try i guess is even higher shift.  \n\nIn the end 576px vs 640px isn't huge I know, but still noticeable. I'm just trying to find out how to squeeze out the best quality I can at higher res. ",

          "text": "Yeah, that’s actually a pretty common issue with **Wan 2.2 i2v** — once you bump the resolution past \\~576×1024, the temporal consistency starts fighting against the motion interpolation. The model wasn’t really optimized for higher-res frame deltas, so you get that “slow-mo drag” effect even with similar sampler configs.\n\nA few things you could test:\n\n* **Keep shift lower (6–8)** but raise **motion guidance scale** slightly — sometimes too much shift causes the model to “over-smooth” motion.\n* Try **shorter clips** and upscale after with **VideoChain** or **Topaz AI**; Wan seems happier generating smaller frames fast.\n* If you’re using **LoRAs**, try freezing them below 0.8 weight — some trained LoRAs exaggerate frame blending.\n* You can also disable *adaptive denoise* (if your frontend allows it) to regain some frame-to-frame sharpness.\n\nIn short, Wan’s temporal module scales badly with higher resolutions right now. The devs mentioned on Discord that they’re experimenting with patch-based generation for higher-res video, so hopefully that fixes it in a future update",

      "text": "I discovered this while trying to make boring work tasks less soul-crushing. These tiny tweaks turn any mundane topic into something you actually want to read:\n\n1. Add \"What's the hidden story behind...\" — Suddenly everything has intrigue. \n\n> \"What's the hidden story behind office coffee machines?\" \n\nBoom - corporate psychology, addiction economics, social hierarchies.\n\n2. Use \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about...\" — Gets you that outsider perspective that reveals the weird stuff we ignore. \n\n> \"What would an alien anthropologist notice about LinkedIn?\" \n\nPure comedy gold.\n\n3. Ask \"What's the conspiracy theory version of...\" — Not actual conspiracies, but the connecting-dots thinking. \n\n> \"What's the conspiracy theory version of why meetings exist?\" \n\nUncovers power dynamics you never saw.\n\n4. Try \"How is [boring thing] secretly a survival skill?\" — Evolution angle makes everything relevant. \n\n> \"How is small talk secretly a survival skill?\" \n\nTurns awkward chitchat into advanced social intelligence.\n\n5. Flip to \"What would happen if we took [thing] to its logical extreme?\" — Pushes ideas to their breaking point. \n\n> \"What if we took remote work to its logical extreme?\" \n\nReveals both possibilities and problems.\n\n6. End with \n\n> \"What does this reveal about human nature?\"  \n\nThe psychology angle that makes everything profound. Every mundane topic becomes a window into who we really are.\n\nThe trick works because it hijacks your brain's pattern-seeking mode. Instead of seeing isolated facts, you start seeing systems, stories, and connections everywhere.\n\nBest part: This works on literally anything. Tried it on \"filing taxes\" and got a fascinating breakdown of social contracts, trust systems, and why we collectively agree to this madness.\n\nSecret sauce: Combine multiple angles. \n\n> \"What's the hidden story behind email signatures? What would an alien anthropologist notice? What does this reveal about human nature?\"\n\nEven grocery shopping becomes anthropologically fascinating with these prompts.\n\nWhat's the most boring topic you've accidentally made interesting?\n\nFor more such free and comprehensive prompts, visit our free [Prompt Collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/), a free, intuitive and helpful prompt resource base.",

      "text": "I’ve had ChatGPT Plus for about three years now and honestly, it used to be amazing. But lately It feels like I’m talking to the most generic AI tool that’s ever existed. Every answer sounds like it’s been written by a robot who skimmed a Wikipedia summary.\n\nWhat’s weird is that it keeps referencing stuff from years ago like it’s stuck in 2022. I’ve tried cleaning out my memory, deleting a ton of old stuff, but that somehow made it even worse. Now the responses are flatter, lazier, and totally miss the nuance I used to get.\n\nAt this point, I’m  wondering if I should just delete this account and start over from scratch. Has anyone else done that? Did it actually help?\n\nBecause if I get one more generic repetitive answer… I’m going to loose it. \n\nThanks 😊 ",

      "text": "At this moment there is a very strong push towards LLMs (and not Artificial Intelligence in general) and towards the so-called “agentic” model (you have noticed, right? /s). As the italian comedian Carmine Faraco said: “la domanda non è commé, è pecché?” (the question is not how it works, but why)\n\nMost automation workflows are deterministic or at least semi-deterministic. This means that for a given input, the output is predictable, or nearly so, and the rules governing it are clear. In such end-to-end processes, adding an “agent” that interprets, decides, or improvises does not add value. On the contrary, it often introduces noise, inconsistency, and additional points of failure. The result is not just a neutral trade-off but a net loss: lower output quality, higher operational costs, and greater architectural complexity that cannot be justified by the supposed “intelligence” of the system.\n\nIn practice, I very often see wrappers or integrations of {{ *insert current fashionable LLM that is allegedly better than the previous fashionable LLM for this specific task because the company with the “best Benchmark” of the moment says* }} *so* being applied to problems that were already solved decades ago by well-established algorithms. And instead of improving results, the addition of a generative layer usually makes them worse.\n\nThink of trivial operations like counting letters, calculating differences between strings, comparing files, or identifying poses and faces. These are tasks for deterministic algorithms, not for stochastic models that sometimes “hallucinate.” Replacing reliable and efficient code with an LLM call not only wastes resources but also undermines predictability, reproducibility, and control.\n\nThere is, of course, a small subset of problems that genuinely benefits from some level of artificial intelligence. Within that subset there is an even smaller group of cases where LLMs actually make sense: scenarios involving ambiguous natural language, open-ended reasoning, or tasks where interpretive flexibility is valuable. But this final subgroup is narrow, and by its very nature excludes business-critical processes or any process where accuracy must be guaranteed and error tolerance is close to zero.\n\nSo I repeat the question: “the question is not what it can do, but why?” Why must everything suddenly become an “agent”? Why are we trying to replace stable, deterministic systems with probabilistic layers that bring fragility where robustness was already achieved?",

          "text": "Creating an action-based WhatsApp chatbot that can perform tasks like generating invoices or sending emails is definitely an interesting project. Here are some recommendations and considerations based on existing technologies:\n\n- **Open-Source Models**: You might want to explore using models like Llama, which have shown promise in various enterprise tasks. They can be fine-tuned or adapted to handle specific commands effectively.\n\n- **Agent Frameworks**: Consider using frameworks that support task execution, such as Rasa or Botpress. These frameworks allow you to build conversational agents that can integrate with APIs to perform actions based on user commands.\n\n- **Integration with APIs**: For actions like generating invoices or sending emails, you'll need to integrate your chatbot with relevant APIs (e.g., payment processing, email services). This will enable the chatbot to execute commands and perform tasks.\n\n- **Test-Time Adaptive Optimization (TAO)**: If you're looking to improve the performance of your model without labeled data, you might explore techniques like TAO, which leverages test-time compute and reinforcement learning. This could help in fine-tuning your model based on user interactions.\n\n- **Data Collection**: Implement a system to collect user inputs and interactions to continuously improve the chatbot's performance. This can create a feedback loop that enhances the model over time.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring TAO further, you can find more information [here](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h). \n\nFeel free to reach out if you want to collaborate or share ideas on this project.",

We get pulled into conversations, messages, and meetings to \"give input\" on these new potential projects several times a week, almost everyday. Manager puts whoever seems idle at the moment (aka if he thinks they've been quiet recently) on each new project that he learns about, even though there are existing projects that we've committed to that we need everyone's help on, and even though any seemingly available engineer is not at all the right person for any new project. It feels like musical chairs as people get assigned, then re-assigned to different projects depending on what seems urgent at the moment. \n\nOther teams have taken on some projects that our team should ideally be taking on, so we're being left out of some important company goals. The teams that build the system for those company goals end up owning future projects too, and we get further and further left out.\n\nI've had to protect my productivity by reminding people of existing deadlines that I'm working towards and prioritizing, but it does feel disappointing seeing so many opportunities pass by as well.\n\nHas anyone experienced this? What's the best solution to this problem? \n\nWould it help if everyone on the team worked on one project together, rather than each person getting pulled into a new project? There's quite a bit of overlap between the projects, so I feel it could be effective to work together rather than individually.  I don't know if my manager can be convinced of this approach because he would no longer have \"pawns\" to move in whatever political power grabbing game they're playing. There's also the problem of a project still taking the same amount of time if some people are slow and don't pull their own weight.\n\nDespite all this, leadership thinks our team is already large enough, which makes the situation even more dire. What should I do and what is around the corner that I'm not able to see yet?",
