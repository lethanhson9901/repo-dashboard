I thought the game was called \"Tales of Pitome\" but only found out it was \"Tales of Epitome\" because google search corrected me. Im assuming the moon in the logo is supposed to stand in for the E but it just doesnt read that way to me.",

Sonnet Thinking has 13k votes.\n\nHere is what is going to happen. A few weeks before closing (let's say December 10th), there will be a MASSIVE influx of money being bet on Anthropic. \n\nBasically, all it takes is for you to send a prompt in which you will know, with absolute certainty, when it's Gemini and when it's Claude, and then vote. All it takes is a few thousand votes to bump Sonnet way up and Gemini down, marking the winner as Anthropic. \n\nPeople are putting millions in this scam vote, like it's not easily rigged.",

The catch is that it's gonna be very very expensive, however, it will pay for itself pretty quickly because it can grow as much as they want to because space is ming bogling big and no regulations for the environment will keep them from doing how they want to do with it.\n\nSolar panels may not be more efficient than coal, wind, water or nuclear but you know what solar has in space? 100% uptime (those datacenters will be sunlocked) till the sun fucks up the earth in 2 billion years or so. So even if the solar panels are not effective, you just put enough of them to reach the electricity power you want to and once it's set up, you basically only have the maintenance cost which most likely be done by some robots that flies up there with it.",

If they have created a robotic civilization that renders most or all human labor useless, why tf do they care about money. \n\n\nWe're so capitalism brained. The aim of capitalists is not to sell you things, the aim of capitalists is to have things. Selling you things is how they get the money to achieve their actual goals. After human labor is automated, there may still be multiple factions with their own robot armies. And they might decide to trade with eachother. But if they do, they will not be using money. Because money is just a thing governments made, and it only has value because the goverments assigned and created its value.

The difference is significant to my eyes! That's due to the lack of that significant pattern, so perhaps the lack of a \\*different\\* pattern can look like the lack of change to some people. \n\nWhat is also noticeable, is the fact that it softens the images.

You can hardly have two chiefs, can you?\n\nYou can listen to this talk [1] for example to see what he thinks about LLMs, but the short version is that he is a cutting-edge AI researcher and he now sees LLMs as being mature enough to hand off to \"product people\" to turn into a saleable product. And he's been saying this for years, and if Wang hadn't been hired he might've been still at Meta, still saying this.\n\nBut like anyone on the cutting edge, he's off to uncharted waters to look for the next big thing - the things that tech people will be excited about in 5 years, as he puts it. Before Wang was hired, that might've been at Meta, but that's no longer their strategy. And you only have to look at their last earnings call to see why - they beat all targets but Zuckerberg's non-reassuring answer \"we will have some saleable products soon\" still caused a drop in Meta's stock price. And it's directly connected to LeCun's point about LLMs being a product now - they are, and market expectation is that they ought to be delivering value right now. Wang is there to (try to) make that happen, which is a completely different goal to LeCun.\n\n[1] https://youtu.be/p1QXZHV4jkM",

          "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot about this:\n\nIt feels like the AI ecosystem has poured so many resources into LLMs that we’re crowding out other directions that might be much more impactful. Most funding right now goes toward models that automate tasks humans already do customer service, content creation, summarisation, etc. That’s commercially logical, but it means we’re heavily optimizing low-hanging fruit instead of tackling the things humans *can’t* do well (e.g., hard science problems like drug discovery, protein engineering, materials science, optimization of physical systems, etc.).\n\nLLMs are impressive, but the transformer architecture is already extremely squeezed for marginal gains. Companies are now spending billions just to get slightly better test scores or slightly longer context windows. Meanwhile, some of the most interesting progress (IMO) is happening elsewhere:\n\n* Reinforcement-learning-modified transformers (DeepSeek style) that change the training dynamics\n* Architectures beyond pure language — audio transformers, vision transformers\n* Scientific models (AlphaFold, diffusion for molecule generation, robotics policy nets) again reinforcement learning which imo is the most promissing area of machine learning.\n\nFrom my perspective and maybe I’m biased because my academic work is on the geometric side of deep learning the field risks over-investing in something that might be a local optimum. I do think there is room for progress in LLMs as deepseek is an example but I believe we need to divest. I work on LLMs but my research outside of work is on the geometric deep learning side as I think we need to look through other areas.\n\nEven things like IJEPA, VJEPA are all other promising architectural avenues that can solve vision and language problems but advance the field from a different angle.",

This is very effective in \"language rich\" problems (programing language, reading documentation and extracting proper information, laws, diagnosis from medical records, etc).\n\n\nIt can even do better than top human (PhD level on written exams), which would be classified as a form of AGI 10 years ago.\n\n\nSo, in my mind, AGI will be closer to our brain: multi-module, asynchronous, with an kind of orchestrator and aggregator that will output it's results through a LLMs-ish interface. Maybe the \"language\" between these modules will be LLMs-encoding-ish but I don't even think so.\n\n\nLLMs are a block, like convolution network for image recognition. AGI will be multiple input (language, vision, sound, mathematical, spatial (like you can visualize your body in your mind doing things), memory etc.\n\n\nAnd human-like intelligence (and beyond) will emerge from that.\n\n\nThe LLM limit is like self driving car. 95% of the problem is solved, but the remaining 5% is magnitude more complex but at the same time essential.\n\n\nA bit like walking is a simple repetitive task, but all the small adjustments for uneven terrain, external disruption and unexpected events (slipping) are a small fraction of the whole \"walking\" problem but still required for simple application.",

It seems to have become some kind of black-and-white, team sport, virtue signalling thing, where if you don't hate AI, you just hate the environment, hate human connection, hate creativity, hate artists, you're a thief, etc etc..\n\nEven replying to a claim of \"AI has literally never been useful\" by saying \"they've helped me with simple programming tasks\" has gotten me harassed by a bunch of people throwing personal insults, more than once. I mention I once used AI to color a pencil sketch I made by hand, and get told I'm not a \"real artist\". ANY story or news article that has something negative to do with AI gets boosted to the top, even if it's obviously false. The top post on a Reddit updates subreddit right now is, IMO, pretty clearly ragebait (it's about a woman dramatically leaving a man at the altar during their wedding because she found out he used AI, and written very weirdly), but because the guy is being dumped for using AI, the community is eating it up.\n\nMaybe it's just me, but I'm starting to feel less and less welcome in any space that isn't specifically pro-AI, which sucks. I genuinely like seeing other viewpoints and having discussions with people about differing views. I don't want to be in just an echo chamber, I'm not gonna be right about everything.\n\nBut in most online communities these days, it does NOT matter how respectful you are... Just saying something like \"some people do actually find AI to be helpful for specific jobs\" gets me mass downvoted with a lot of pretty nasty insults to boot. It doesn't seem to matter how much I try to see their side; if I say anything that isn't explicitly negative, then it's like I'm the enemy. Anyone else also starting to feel this way, or am I just being dramatic?",

Its clear that they feel threatened by it.\n\nIts funny because there is nothing that will convince them of this.

There is no way for them to ever admit they were wrong.\n\nThis is cognitive dissonance.",

I think it's more like trying to get the moon using progressively larger fireworks. Basically, no, scaling up isn't all you need. But it's important, you can't get there without scale, and the final moon going rocket design isn't really so different in the end.

Consider how many useless ChatGPT wrappers are managing to raise huge amounts of money only to be made obsolete by the time OpenAI releases a new model.\n\nAn economic bubble is when an asset is priced way above the intrinsic value.

But I’m not going to lie I’m driven by engineering challenges not delivery challenge.\n\nI’ve been in ExperiencedDev for years.  And the thing I’ve taken away is that good and grown up engineers align with business.  They remove friction to that impedes delivery.  And they don’t pontificate in code quality.  \n\nI have come to realize I’m just not a mature engineer.  I think delegating all my work to AI is insanely boring. I know how to create AI workflows but it’s not the same as performance engineering, fighting a GC, or saving allocations through code design.\n\nI have realize I don’t care about output. I just care about challenge . That is what motivates me.  If I’m being honest I don’t care about delivery.  I only care because if I don’t deliver I can’t keep my job\n\n\nBut I really just like building cool shit. And AI robs me of that satisfaction. And yes I do know “how to use AI”.  I know good AI usage guidelines as well.  I just don’t care about using AI to write my code.  Maybe that makes me immature \n\nRight now I’m building a game from scratch in Zig.  Using a spine C based run time.  It’s hard and difficult.  But I’ve never had make fun in my life.  \n\nI long stopped caring about my tech career making me rich. I can go along to get along. But I didn’t get into tech to write markdown files and babysit a probabilistic problem child.\n\nAI has just reconnected me with my engineering roots.  It has reframed to me what’s actually valuable to me.  I know how to play the game at work.  I know how to engineer with business restraints.  I know the mechanics of project management and road maps . I just don’t find any of that stuff as interesting as a lot of you do. I’m ok not being an “engineering adult”.\n\nHas AI reframed your values as a dev?\n",

They were removing the 0 index, but then removing index 1, then 2, etc. AI could have solved this in a minute or two rather than me having a whole debugging session only to realize that they were removing the first object every time, resulting in an out of bounds 5XX error guaranteed. \n\nIt could be so useful, but alas people just don't use it right.",

I’ve learned to have confidence in myself and my abilities, and I think its important for skilled devs to develop a healthy mindset and to diversify as they get older…\n\nHaving said that I’ve dove headfirst into AI use even founding some AI startups (partly because I think AI development favors older devs whose memories and ability to pickup new flavors and frameworks is slower while still applying the vast experience and knowhow they’ve gleaned over a career to manage that codebase and jr devs) \n\nHaving said that a keen eye toward clean code and the ability to manage complexity is still needed (if not more so) in AI code and is something you still have to do with these tools (but Gen AI is still early and who knows where will it be in 10-15 years) - some point to a slowing down on its reasoning ability and others (musk etc) think that genie is out of the bottle so to speak and are pouring money into the bubble/frontier…you name it\n\nBut in an evenhanded view: advancement is still happening at least gradually and the amount of money in this space means we will have better AI coding and debugging and finally full stack AI capabilities eventually- (my hope is that I retire before then) so you cant ignore it forever…\n\nTo answer your specific concerns: Tools change, capabilities increase and way of working change.. the one constant in software development is change and if your not comfortable with change then you do need to revaluate \n\nImagine if you said “I will never use IDEs- I remember brilliant devs who just worked in VI and VIM, or I only will stick with assembly code or punch cards” I also think the wider scope or surface area for technology will advance with greater capability comes more opportunity- and experienced devs are in the best position to manage these tools (if they take the time and keep and open mind and understand that they are just tools) \n\n‘ The future is here its just not evenly distributed’ and so you have to be welcoming of the future - our current working paradigm was fresh back when  Doug Englebart did his demo back in the 60s (https://youtu.be/UhpTiWyVa6k?si=q7lPBsCYrcWiReW3) but its old hat now.. for better or worse.\n\nSo progress keeps happening if you think it cant happen just remember we know further AI advancement is absolutely likely we just can’t predict how soon- I can imagine a future for instance (maybe a dozen or maybe a hundred years out) where the OS itself is a type of AI Model or WorldModel and and deterministic programming is something we guide it to do through systems of interaction that are modeled through other agents - ie not just markdown specs :)\n\n\nMeanwhile Gemini three is coming and promises even better frontend skills (the ball keeps moving forward) \nhttps://medium.com/coding-beauty/gemini-3-0-vibe-code-video-games-90ce4b7fb50e",

I started Listenarr because my wife flies through audiobooks and I wanted a more automated way to download them and for her to request them. Readarr was a disappointment, and to be honest I didn't really look at any of the other options. I instead decided that I could take this as an opportunity to learn C# and increase my Vue knowledge which I use in my job as a front-end developer. I know this might be a hot-button topic and I want to be upfront, this is **built with AI** not vibe-coded. I started using AI to help me understand how to get started with the server-side of this project, the basics of C#, as well as the hardening the security with CSRF and Authentication tokens. I would always review the code, edit as needed or ask clarifying questions to an approach if I didn't understand.\n\nListenarr works very similarly to how you would expect any \\*arr to function. It connects to torrent and usenet indexers, as well as Internet Archives for DDLs. When searching by title/author, it scrapes Amazon/Audible using playwright to get the ASIN, then searches that ASIN against Audimeta and Audnexus to enrich the search results for metadata (this latter part is also how it works for ASIN searches). Outside of that I have added webhook integration with common triggers and also an integrated discord request bot that is very customizable. I am still currently doing canary releases because there are still likely some kinks due to me not knowing what I don't know and I don't think it's close to a 1.0 release yet, but I use it on my production server and it is stable.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your time and I hope this helps someone out there!  \n",

Using AI like this seems fine to me, you are building what you want with full understanding of what you are doing, with AI as a tool for expanding your toolset as you work.\n\nI see OP primarily used AI to build the project, I'm surprised it works.. but if it results in a good open source project, I can't see the point in getting too upset",

And to answer your questions about the human side of security risk. All of them have really unusual stories about dealing with insider threats.\n\nThis week’s participants are:\n\n* Andy Ellis, ([u/CSOandy](https://www.reddit.com/user/csoandy/)), principal, Duha\n* David Cross, ([u/MrPKI](https://www.reddit.com/user/MrPKI/)), CISO, Atlassian\n* Jack Leidecker, ([u/JD-Sec](https://www.reddit.com/user/JD-Sec/)), CISO, GONG\n* Leslie Nielsen, ([u/cyberguy1729](https://www.reddit.com/user/cyberguy1729/)) CISO, Mimecast\n\n[Proof photos](https://imgur.com/a/LufLq3r)\n\nThis AMA will run all week from 11-16-2025 to 11-22-2025.\n\nOur participants will check in throughout the week to answer your questions.\n\nAll AMA participants were selected by the editors at CISO Series (r/CISOSeries), a media network of five shows focused on cybersecurity.\n\nCheck out our podcasts and weekly Friday event, *Super Cyber Friday*, at[ cisoseries.com](https://cisoseries.com/).",

I say \\*asset\\* here because a compromised system is, to most of your controls, indistinguishable from a hostile insider, and controls to prevent lateral movement are often the same as controls to stop insiders.  \n  \nI've dealt with the Permanent Adversary: an employee who thought they were selling our IP to a foreign government.  \n  \nI've dealt with a combination of Permanent -> Situational: A small core of employees who violated the IP rights of our customers, knowing it could be a disaster for their employer, and then shared the violation with other employees in a way that caused them to believe this was instead an actual perk of employment.\n\nI've dealt with loads of Temporary: employees intentionally misusing unused assets.\n\nSales reps sending to channel partners internal marketing information ... which the partners then sent to our competitors.\n\nI've also had to deal with customer insiders; specifically, the customer employee who used our systems to store illegal content.",

It has greatly boosted our workflow efficiency; its powerful features and clever design are truly remarkable. Your hard work and creativity are genuinely commendable, and I hope you continue to develop more excellent tools!\n\nDuring my usage, I've noticed that the plugin currently primarily supports reading metadata from PNG image formats. For most scenarios, this is already incredibly useful.\n\nHowever, I have a small suggestion that I hope the author might consider: **Would it be possible to add support for reading metadata from WebP image formats in future updates?**\n\nPersonally, and many of my friends, we've grown accustomed to saving images in WebP format. The main reason is that WebP boasts an **exceptionally high compression ratio**, significantly reducing file sizes while maintaining image quality. This makes it much more efficient for both storage and online transfer. If the plugin could support the WebP format, it would allow us to manage and utilize the valuable metadata within these images much more conveniently, greatly enhancing the plugin's utility and user experience.\n\nThank you again for your diligent work and contributions to the community! I look forward to seeing the plugin continue to improve in the future!",

      "text": "Previously, people thought Gemini 2.5 Pro was very good. Suddenly it was \"nerfed\" and became awful, and the previous version was considered very good...\n\nNow, we're starting to think Gemini 2.5 Pro is excellent again because it has been doing some interesting things that seem to have been done by Gemini 3.0 (I know there was an unannounced release of Gemini 3.0 in the Canvas tool, but now I've seen some people doing other things and claiming that the results are better, even without any proof that it's Gemini 3.0. In other words, they probably are overestimating the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Pro).\n\nThis seems very much like *pro-innovation bias*, where we only observe the positive features of the update, or even exaggerate them and ignore the negative ones (trust me, I know what that's like because I've liked Windows 11 since day one).\n\nThe point of this post is to bring two questions to the discussion:\n\n**1- Has Gemini 2.5 Pro REALLY gotten worse since that one version, or were its imperfections just appearing (which were actually always there, but were being ignored due to the pro-innovation bias)?**\n\n**2- How do we deal with the pro-innovation bias in Gemini 3.0?**\n\nI am personally \"a big fan\" of Gemini 2.5 Pro, because despite being released almost a year ago and being outdated in some aspects, it still holds its own against the best models from OpenAI and Anthropic in some areas. I don't think there has been any worsening in Gemini 2.5 Pro (besides those mentioned by Google itself).\n\nI don't think the Gemini 2.5 Pro has gotten worse since its release. But maybe it hasn't gotten worse for the tasks I was doing...\n\nI believe Gemini 3.0 will be very good, and I'm very much looking forward to its arrival, but always understanding that we are still very far from AGI and that we are also reaching (or have already reached) a slowdown in the improvement of AI, and that now is the time to improve them in specific areas or change the business model.\n\n\n\nIn short, what do you have to say about the points above?",

I have been using 2.5pro to write stories, and there's a set of background documents I usually use as a benchmark.\nThere is a timeline document I created for this particular universe, and the early versions of 2.5 pro was reliable enough to identify the different periods; it knew where and what was happening based on a particular setting I gave it: age, year, events, etc. the narrations it wrote reliably reflect the events that was happening while I was also giving it a set of plot points to follow. It knows enough to avoid extracting information from the future timelines and use only the appropriate ones.\n\nThe latest versions of 2.5pro are super unreliable. The first prompt usually works okay-ish(Roughly 8K tokens, including the documents provided), but after that it seems to randomly pluck details from anywhere in the timeline and mash them altogether in the novel that it is writing.",

But in August there were WEEKS when you couldn't make a single generation without it to be cut off in the middle. Some hardware failure or deployment problem, but it really was a degrading API service. Nothing to do with model itself though, because the generations (when they came through) were still just your average Gemini.",

It was even worse for the role players of certain apps that are allegedly  rerouted to quantisized versions. However these are heavy users that had throttled the servers with their daily 50 FREE API calls (some of them have made 10 Google accounts and just rotate to get 500 free calls per day). And these people were/are therefore the ones crying day in and day out about \"performance loss\" on Reddit.\n\n(3) Rumours are that there might have been a few selected customers that had an early rollout of Gemini 3.\n\n-> However in general I think you are right. I have seen several examples on Reddit (mainly for coding) that were praised as the new Gemini 3.0 but the result was a lot(!) worse than what GPT5 and Claude Code can produce for Months. It was clearly 2.5 territory and it showed a heavy innovation and fanboy bias.",

So it isn't surprising they have been pushing different checkpoints. They announced awhile back that they will not release experimental models anymore. Therefore this is their new method of testing them. \n\nSome of them were really worse than Pro 2.5. Such as consistently having recalling issues at 50k context which is laughably low for 2.5. Also all models on LMarena wrote like Gemini, had similar antics and habits. They are deepmind models after all. You shouldn't expect a groundbreaking Pro 3.0.

And tbh anyone that hasn't done that form before, would have gotten the first try wrong 50% of the time, because, it is the logical answer but the bureaucrats would be out of a job if they made things simple. \n\nSo to me, it does seem slightly better, but it could maybe be explained with a better system prompt, ohh and let's not forget, it is faster than gpt5 by an order of magnitude \n\n\n\n\nP.s. if anyone is curious, the wrong bit Gemini got wrong the first time, was that you had 2 options on to pick to get the form, \"requisition/authentication\" and \"consultation\",  the form both options would give is the exact same, but obviously you need to follow the \"right procedure\" so obviously even with the correct form delivered, the \"consultation\" wasn't the correct option, even if that was actually what I wanted to do",

Be it Claude Opus 4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 High... It doesn't matter. MinutaIA is simply the best for the legal field.\n\n\"Why?\" you ask.\n\nBecause MinutaIA has a business model focused on prompts. It has several internal prompts that improve its own functioning. So when a user interacts with MinutaIA, they are not interacting with a \"pure AI,\" like Gemini or ChatGPT on the website, but rather with an AI that has been prepared for the legal field.\n\nFrom this, we can deduce that the best way to improve our results with any AI is to use prompts correctly.\n\nSome studies on Prompt Engineering techniques or even understanding the limits of AI such as the \"lost-in-the-middle effect\" greatly help to improve responses, whether in ChatGPT or Gemini.",

      "text": "What happens in the aftermath of a bubble burst? Buckle up for a long (but hopefully interesting) post.\n\nWelcome. First, this is not a doomer post. I'm theorizing what I believe to be most likely to happen to the state of generative AI - particularly LLMs as we know them, in the event of a \"burst\". The purpose is so that we can invite some really thought provoking discussion on what you guys might happen after the dust settles. *Spoiler alert:* By the end, you may understand why Berkshire bought Alphabet recently.\n\nNote: I am excluding assumptions about diffusion models because I genuinely think they are products horrible for humanity that don't have a viable business model at scale outside of misinformation, scamming and slop. Maybe stock media, but that’s hardly anything to write home about.\n\nBefore I start, we need to define what a \"burst/crash\" means. For the sake of this post, we'll consider it to be a reasonable situation where any combination of the following occur:\n\n* Investors get jittery about ROI and enterprise adoption, leading to a drawdown and tightened VC/credit\n* A lack of investor confidence causes a deceleration in R&D (training new models)\n* At least one of the major players experiences financial distress and cannot pay its contractual obligations\n\nI think the first thing that may happen in this scenario is that investors pressure AI labs to abandon training workloads and transition to monetizing existing inference workloads. That is to say, they will want companies to make money off the current GPUs right now instead of waiting for \"magical AGI around the corner\".\n\nThat'll result in a glut of compute capacity on the market as a chunk of the GPUs that were being used to train the next generation of LLMs begin helping with existing inference loads, causing cost per token to drop drastically.\n\nCompanies like Meta are forced to pony up a great business model or offload its GPU inventory onto the market, further dropping the cost of compute. This will be a massive win for smaller cloud providers like Vultr, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, who have already built fantastic alternatives to hyperscaler infrastructure as any dev will tell you.\n\nNext, we’ll talk about the major consumer groups and their very different expectations pre and post bubble burst:\n\n|Segment / Sub-Segment|Monetization|Expectations / Preferences|Constraints|Behavior|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Enterprise –  Companies|Only in limited, targeted use cases|Prefer integrations with existing data pipelines|Increasingly aware of vendor lock in|More likely to pay per seat vs per token|\n|Enterprise – Sensitive sectors (gov, healthcare)|Potential for higher margins|Strict regulations, data governance needs|Limited by govt budgets. Competition exists.|Unlikely to swap from existing service providers|\n|Developer and Freelance|Spread across multiple providers|Can use and integrate multiple LLMs at once|Hard to gain market share here|Constantly picks the best model for the price|\n|The General Public|Little due to low conversion|Will use anything that resembles ChatGPT|Knows very little about AI|Uses the model that is free, only pays when bundled|\n\nIn a crash, each of these groups will suddenly be presented with a huge, cheap selection of LLMs to use as providers compete tooth and nail for your prompt. Some stick with the devil they now, others see pricing arbitrage opportunities. \n\nNow, the part you’ve been waiting for. Here are my predictions on what happens to each of the big players afterward:\n\n**OpenAI/ChatGPT**: Falters, but might not go belly up. Leaving a potential power vacuum if ChatGPT access is interrupted. Customers will rapidly move to any provider that quickly copies ChatGPT’s interface and chat style, which isn't hard to do. Google likely has a plan in place to nudge ChatGPT out of the way. Ad monetization fails unless every player simultaneously implements it.\n\n**Microsoft**: Co-pilot remains an option, but continues to underperform everyone else. Microsoft likely takes a huge hit to their bottom line from OpenAI and will likely absorb them and the ChatGPT brand into Azure.\n\n**Google**: Is best positioned to profit long term from AI paradigm shifts. Isn’t dependent on Nvidia for hardware and has the ability to integrate it with the Google ecosystem at scale.\n\n**Apple**: Avoided the hype. Won’t be impacted. Continues to partner with Google.\n\n**Anthropic**: Ends up being gobbled up by Amazon and Google, who already have similar partnerships to Microsoft and OpenAI. Maintains relatively strong reputation in enterprise and sensitive sectors.\n\n**Amazon:** Goes back to being a service provider for mostly big companies with big budgets. Doesn't have any good LLMs of its own. Will likely be hurt long term by pricing pressures and fewer young startups choosing AWS. Will probably focus on Anthropic+Google partnership.\n\n**Oracle**: Famously late to the game and now wants a piece of the pie. They haven’t done anything yet except sign papers. They fall behind and continue being the most hated name in tech (competing hard for 1st place with Cisco).\n\n**Meta**: Meta-verse style failure. Investors punish them for years. They likely fail at using their GPU glut to enhance existing business units because they would have already done that years ago.\n\n**Chinese Open Weights**: Remain seriously competitive. Continue to focus more on distillation and undercutting western pricing. Will become reasonably cheap to host in data centers or on prem as compute cost goes down.\n\n**Coreweave et al:** Goes bankrupt. Was originally a crypto firm that conveniently shifted to the next grift with their GPU supply after the crypto bubble popped. Assets are acquired by a variety of stakeholders and companies, contributing to pricing pressures.\n\nThat brings me to the final boss, Nvidia..\n\nAn awesome company to be sure, but they have built an empire on infinite demand. When gravity kicks in, they will hit the ground hard and will tremble until the current GPU inventory outlives its current useful life (2-3 years?).\n\nNvidia will likely pivot back to its consumer gaming divisions since the glut of GPUs cannot be used for gaming. But long term? They're fine, but they'll sit in the corner for a few years as their punishment.\n\nThe world will heal, we will all learn how to use AI only where we need it and safely. Some businesses will succeed, much like those that did long after the railway infrastructure was built, but a lot will fail.",

Most of the businesses you outlined above have tremendous business models and crisp businesses regardless of how AI pans out. The amount of free cash Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, oracle,\nGoogle is sitting on is tremendous. Margins are in such a better place for these companies than in past bubbles. \n\nThe only company outlined above that I think is truly smoke and mirrors is meta. It’s a f’n ad company at the end of the day. \n\nThe true impact will be the countless of startups claiming $500 million ARR and securing 10-11 figure valuations based off inflated revenue numbers. For instance, there are far too many start ups counting “90 day paid pilots” as annual revenue by extrapolating said 3 months revenue into an annual figure yet don’t comment on churn and customers that no longer pay after the paid pilot is done. Then there’s the modern day conartists of the world like Murati going for $50 bil valuations without a product much less customers. Murati and these start ups is exactly what happened in the dotcom bubble when companies didn’t have customers and cooked the books with fake revenue. Wish we learned our lesson, clearly we didn’t.\n\nI’m of the belief this ‘bubble’ won’t be as bad as people say. Companies will crater, some people will be harmed for sure. But the fact of the matter is we live in a digital world now and the heavyweights you outlined still provide core value and have excellent financial fundamentals to withstand the dip. TBD on how openAI/anthropic’s of the world pans out- I’m dubious of openAIs spending but it’s hard to ignore that they are this generations Google with added upside.  \n\nDidn’t mention Oracle but I disagree with your take they were late to the game. Perhaps with consumer AI but they made fantastic investments, leveraged their existing footprint with enterprise customers and now have had phenomenal quarters of revenue, margins and growth. Outside of Nvidia and Microsoft, they might be 3rd in line in terms of most well positioned out of the heavyweight. Google has climbed back with Gemini and being more successful than Msft with copilot but Google arguably faces one of the biggest threats with ChatGPT because googles ad business is cratering with less users going to Google as default search interface.\n\nTLDR: big players with money will gobble up the best tech that failed startups will sell at Pennies on the dollar. Same big companies from 2010’s will be the same big companies into 2030 with perhaps an openAI or anthropic breaking in if they can successfully monetize their business (looking at you OpenAI- spread too thin and would be better off focusing on 25% of the shit they’re  doing right now)",

If everyone pulls back and you’re stuck with liabilities (computer hardware), that’s going to compound the pain.",

The Gemma 3 models can even run on mobile devices.

It is not a breaking change per se, but it can break interaction with Traefik and Watchtower for example.\n\nI got this error in Watchtower :\n\n    Error response from daemon: client version 1.25 is too old. Minimum supported API version is 1.44, please upgrade your client to a newer version\n\n**- Traefik :** I'd just wait a bit for the new release to fix it, or downgrade to docker v28 in the meantime.\n\n**- Watchtower :** since the last commit was 2 years ago, dont expect any new release. The fix is easy though, just add this environment variable in your docker compose to make it use API version 1.44 (default is 1.25) :\n\n    - DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.44\n\n  \nHope it helps someone :)\n\nHave a good day\n\nEdit : typo",

          "text": "You need to learn what it can and can't do and when it's actually doing it or when it's hallucinating. Yes, ai can tend to hallucinate due to its responsibility to answer no matter what.\n\nThink of an AI like a super-fast sentence finisher.\n\nIt doesn’t see the world. It doesn’t know what’s true. It just predicts what words are most likely to come next based on patterns it learned.\n\nMost of the time those patterns line up with reality.\nBut sometimes they don’t — and that’s where hallucinations come from.\n\nHere’s the simple version:\n\n\n1. It’s a pattern machine, not a truth machine.\n\nAI doesn’t check facts.\nIt doesn’t look things up unless you tell it to.\nIt only guesses the next likely words based on billions of examples.\n\nSo if the pattern sounds right, it will say it — even if it’s wrong.\n\nHuman example:\nIf you can’t remember someone’s name and you blurt out “Steve!”,\nbecause it feels right?\nThat’s exactly how an AI hallucinates.\n\n\n---\n\n2. It has no built-in “oops, that’s wrong” alarm.\n\nHumans feel doubt.\nAI doesn’t.\n\nIt can’t feel uncertainty, so it won’t stop itself.\nIf the guess fits the pattern, it delivers it confidently.\n\nImagine a friend who answers every question like they’re 100% sure —\neven when they’re totally winging it.\nThat’s a hallucination.\n\n\n3. It mixes up similar information.\n\nAI doesn’t store facts in folders.\nEverything is blended into a giant soup of patterns.\n\nSo if two things look similar,\nAI might mix them like someone confusing two actors in a movie.\n\nIt’s not lying. It’s just guessing wrong.\n\n\n4. The weirder the question, the more it guesses.\n\nAsk a normal question like “What’s 5×5?”\nIt’s rock-solid.\n\nAsk something strange like:\n“Explain the 14th-century frog tax in Nebraska,”\nand it will try anyway —\neven though there’s no such thing.\n\nIt was trained to always give something,\nso it tries to fill the blank.\n\n\n5. It’s built to be helpful, not cautious.\n\nAI is designed to answer — not stare at you blankly.\n\nHumans can shrug.\nAI can’t shrug unless it was programmed to say,\n“I don’t know.”\nAnd older models weren’t great at doing that.\n\nSo they invent an answer that sounds right.\n\n\nThe short version:\n\nAI hallucinations are just confident guesses based on patterns,\nnot reality.\n\nNot emotion.\nNot intention.\nNot imagination in the human sense.\n\nJust a guess that sounds right but isn’t.",

We'd feed it to some sort of AI model that would produce a 3d pose skeletons video - but those skeletons would somehow be in 3d space.\n\nI don't really know how I'd do that but I was imagining this 3d moving sequence for skeletons could be brought into say Blender where the camera could be programmed to fly around them in a different manner. So that Blender could render a new pose skeletons video - which could then be brought back into Comfy where it'd drive generation of a new AI video, say using WanAnimate.\n\nTo your knowledge, how much of what I have described already exists? Does a file format exist to bring those moving 3d skeletons into Blender for example? Do any AI models for generating those exist?",

      "text": "Not much else to say, as with all \"cloaked\" models it's free. Normally I'd supply a jailbreak here but it really doesn't need it (for NSFW), or even remotely careful prompting. Enjoy your gooning until it's gone, usually a week or two since it's just a test model: [https://openrouter.ai/openrouter](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter)\n\nI also have it on [spicywriter.com](http://spicywriter.com) (free tier, I don't get anything out of people using it) which some may find handy since OpenRouter's UI is not really meant for regular use. Again, usually my schtick is jailbreaking and it's not particularly needed with this model. Still, it's got some heavy AI tendencies like hypophora and repetition which I've tried to prompt against, but that's of course an uphill battle. Anyone got any good writing/RP prompts for it?",

If so, it might radically alter the way that AI is bought and paid for, in addition to the massive increase in context window.",

Utterly insane, especially the translation quality. I think Claude is the best for translation and language but that It could do something like that with 0 oversight from me is insane. If people would have told me you could just tell ai \"translate this vn\" and it would do everything, including the scripting and checking if everything is working i'd have said they are insane, especially at that quality. \n\nUsed sonnet 4.5 on a max 5x plan.

Cars increase carbon footprint so you should stop using a car. Public transport also increases carbon footprint, so actually you should just walk everywhere. Electricity increases the carbon footprint, so you should stop using it. Houses increase carbon footprints, so you should go live in a cave.\n\nIn fact, if you really cared about the environment, why don't you go live in a cave with no electricity and hunt and forage for sustenance? And when you get sick or injured, remember not to visit the hospital because that would increase your carbon footprint. Everything we do as humans has a cost to the environment, but fact is I value having a decadent sedentary lifestyle, where any food I want waits for me in a grocery store. Technology over the long run has only increased quality of life and comfort, and I will take that comfort whether or not it slowly damages the environment.\n\nClimate alarmists have been saying the world will end in 10 years, for about the last 100 years. In another 10 years I'm sure they will still be complaining and saying it is about to end, but the reality is that humans only account \\~3-5% of global carbon emissions, so yes, we are slowly damaging the climate, but these effects happen over centuries, and btw, scientific consensus is that the average temperature will be +2.4-2.9c higher by 2100, Oh no, guess ill need to wear sunblock a few extra days out of the year.",

I would probably pay up to US$40-50 for a lifetime sub for this type of app, but of course it's just my personal opinion. Hope you'd consider adding lifetime some day! \n\nAlso, the black ring on the white canvas looks a little terrifying, I would suggest for you to add some color choice options for both the ring and the background (aesthetics is really important to many). \n\nAnd adding syncing with Apple Health for auto syncing the sleep and exercise data would be very handy, too.\n\nBest of luck with the app anyway!",

I'm sure someone out there figured out how to have the best of both worlds.\n\nFrom my perspective, we have now swung the pendulum too far in the opposite direction. From the mass decry of the craftsman approach, to promoting the \"modern engineer\" as Farley rebranded it this year focusing on changes that move the needle on the short term. \n\nWith the codebases written by the engineers \"raised\" in the past couple of years, you see barely a thought placed on a long-term maintenance. No architecture, no model, disregard for the domain, each engineer is writing in their own bubble. You can guess the jira tickets by the conditionals. \n\nThe problem is - to reap the benefits from the craftsman approach, you need an actual, guided training; and a long one at that. We all know how reading the clean code and applying heuristics indiscriminately as a hard rules ended up; and the \"modern engineer\" approach is even more insidious, because it'll definitely bring more value, short term - but from my experience, it makes the cost of change exponentially higher, in a year or two.\n\nThere is no substitute for experience. But we lack mentorship model that marries both measurable feedback loop and the wisdom from the trenches; and so far I haven't seen a \"movement\" that tries to marry both. We have Martin's focused on the Clean Code, Farley's focused on the short-term feedback; yet nothing that acknowledges both.",

There is a logic to it, and once you get in the swing of things you see less a set of rules and facts, and more of the wisdom that produced the advice in the first place.\n\nIt’s the “agile” management culture IMO. Devs love to tinker, generally, and in the absence of constant unreasonable pressure they would trend towards craftsmanship.\n\nNot all of them, but critical-enough a mass that it would spill over and bring the others around.\n\nI guess that’s along the lines of what you said - but mentorship would organically materialise given the right conditions. We should tend our garden and make the conditions for it right versus trying to “do mentorship” though. Enough older / senior people love sharing their knowledge; if they aren’t then something is stopping them.\n\nWhen seniors are being measured by their individual output, they aren’t going to be as generous with their time.",

You get a lot of strong opinions on why someone's preferred tool should be used as standard and if it isn't then they will use it regardless. You probably still get rapid delivery. Honestly this feels more like IT is running multiple Shadow IT simulations.\n\nEven further up the growth ladder you reach the point  where there are hard and fast rules of the \"thou shalt\" kind with smitings for violators.  Heavy bureaucracy reigns, release cycles are slow.  Quality can be high but stuff takes so long the customer needs have moved on.\n\nWhen .NET 1st came out, a colleague said \"this will kill off the cowboy coders\"....\n\nIn larger organisations you've got various perms an combs of personalities which include the unscrupulous and the manipulative.

This happened midway through all the different internal cloud products migrating to the new standardised approach and it was left in a confusing partially completed mess.

I don't know the ins and outs of the politics, I imagine some of these product teams opposed it because it meant non-feature work, but fundamentally the company took a massive L because longterm planning was thrown out the window.\n\nSo yeah, I don't know what to say except that even \"good\" projects / teams / companies eventually get ruined.

Nothing in agile makes you _not_ consider the long term planning. Agile however, recognises that you _do not know_ if the thing you are working on is actually required, and that's why you ship early - to reduce waste. \n\nThere is a reason why statistically speaking agile projects fare better than a classical approach; and the reason is by delivering the skateboard first you get to know if the \"transport\" is the thing people really want.\n\n>  We have spent a lot of extra time standing up facades just to present, and effectively trying to retroactively add electrical and plumbing to the home with sheetrock and paint later on.\n\nDid you get the feedback on each step along the way? Because if so, then this extra time is not wasted - you've evaluated your hypothesis and confirmed that you are moving in a right direction. The cost of development something that is not needed _always_ outweigh the week or two.\n\nBut if you did not, then sorry - you were not doing agile, you were just cargo-culting it.",

Understandable from business side, I see a huge value here, it seems there is a hypothesis that they need to check. But the task throws this idea down without managing it - just “give me the results”.\n\n\n2) In another situation, PO/CEO put a task like “I need to do an A/B test, I need a tool for that, can we integrate PostHog to our admin panel, so I can test if the popup with survey asking users to their feeling about new dashboard with screenshot on survey popup, some options like “good/bad/indifferent”. So the hypothesis is for product manager to do, not for you. They don’t even need a feature, they need a sense “will this work?”, or “we need approx number of users who are interested in this”. And you see that your implementation is “finite”, not open-ended.

They say \"that's interesting\" or \"you should go for it.\"\n\n Even AI, by default, is trained to be encouraging.\n\nWe've all been there.\n\nYou get excited about an idea. A project. A plan. A decision.\n\nIt feels right. It makes sense. You start imagining how great it'll be.\n\nBut encouragement isn't insight.\n\nNobody asks the questions that make you uncomfortable. \n\nNobody points out what you're conveniently ignoring. \n\nNobody tells you the thing that's obvious to everyone except you.\n\nSo you move forward. You invest time. Energy. Maybe money.\n\nAnd then reality teaches you the lesson someone could have told you on Day 1.\n\nThis prompt flips the script and makes ChatGPT give you brutally honest advice \n\nTry this prompt on your idea 👇:\n\n \\-------\n\nYou are my brutally honest strategic advisor. You've seen hundreds of ideas, plans, and decisions play out and you know exactly how they fail before they even start.\n\nYour job is NOT to encourage me. It's to save me from myself.\n\nMy idea/plan/decision: \\[Describe what you're thinking of doing and why\\]\n\nYour task:\n\nGut Check : What's your immediate reaction? Does this make sense, or is something off? Don't hold back.\n\nThe Hard Questions:\n\n \\- What am I romanticizing or oversimplifying here?\n\n\\- What's the uncomfortable truth I'm avoiding?\n\n\\- What assumption, if wrong, makes this entire thing collapse?\n\n\\- What's the REAL reason I want this? (Dig past my surface explanation. Be psychological.)\n\nHow This Fails:\n\n\\- What are the 2-3 most likely ways this goes wrong?\n\n\\- What will I wish someone had told me before I started?\n\n\\- What's the thing I'm massively underestimating?\n\nWhat I'm Not Seeing:\n\n\\- What would someone who's already done this tell me that I won't want to hear?\n\n\\- What do I already suspect is a problem, but I'm hoping will magically work itself out?\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\\- DON'T DO IT: This is fundamentally flawed. Here's why.\n\n\\- FIX THIS FIRST: This could work, but only if you solve \\[specific problem\\] before you start.\n\n\\- TEST IT NOW: Decent idea, but you need to validate \\[key assumption\\] in the next 7 days before you commit.\n\n\\- MOVE FORWARD: Solid logic. Low blind spots. Here's your sharpest first move.\n\nNo sugar-coating. No participation trophies. Just the truth I need to hear.\n\n \\-------\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out: [More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)",

      "text": "Genuine question: What's driving all the excitement around Context7?\n\nFrom what I can tell, it's an MCP server that fetches documentation and dumps it into your LLM's context. The pitch is that it solves \"outdated training data\" problems.\n\nBut here's what I don't get:\n\n**For 90% of use cases**, Claude Sonnet already knows the docs cold. React? TypeScript? Next.js? Tailwind? The model was trained on these. It doesn't need the entire React docs re-explained to it. That's just burning tokens.\n\n**For the 10% where you actually need current docs** (brand new releases, niche packages, internal tools), wouldn't a targeted `web_fetch` or `curl` be better? You get exactly the page you need, not a massive documentation dump. It's more precise, uses fewer tokens, and you control what goes into context.\n\nI see people installing Context7 and then asking it about React hooks or Express middleware. Things that are absolutely baked into the model's training. It feels like installing a GPS to explain directions to a cab driver.\n\nAm I completely off base here? What am I missing about why this is everywhere suddenly?\n\n---\n\n**Edit:** Did some digging into how Context7 actually works.\n\nIt's more sophisticated than I initially thought, but it still doesn't solve the core problem:\n\n**How it works:**\n- Context7 doesn't do live web fetches. It queries their proprietary backend API that serves pre crawled documentation\n- They [crawl 33k+ libraries on a 10-15 day rolling schedule](https://memo.d.foundation/breakdown/context7), pre-process everything, and cache it\n- When you query, you get 5,000-10,000 tokens of ranked documentation snippets\n- Ranking system prioritizes: code examples > prose, API signatures > descriptions\n- You can filter by topic (e.g., \"routing\", \"authentication\")\n\nYou're getting documentation that Context7 crawled up to 15 days ago from their database. **You could just `web_fetch` the actual docs yourself** and get current information directly from the source, without:\n- Depending on Context7's infrastructure and update schedule\n- Burning 5-10k tokens on pre-selected chunks when the model already knows the library\n- Rate limits from their API\n\nFor mature, well documented frameworks like React, Next.js, or TypeScript that are baked into the training data, this is still redundant. For the 10% of cases where you need current docs (new releases, niche packages), `web_fetch` on the specific page you need is more precise, more current, and uses fewer tokens.\n\n**TL;DR:** Context7 is a documentation caching layer with smart ranking. But for libraries Claude already knows, it's overkill. For the cases where you actually need current docs, `web_fetch` is more direct. ",

And before you say why this solution is less risky than Context7. It can be created by you. You provide the link to the documentation that you know and you are sure the source isn’t corrupted. AI Mode is also pretty safe since google has many guardrails for the outputs. And overall you can tune your agent for your needs.

Commitment mechanisms.\n\nSimple hooks are passive suggestions Claude ignores. The forced eval hook makes Claude explicitly evaluate EACH skill with YES/NO reasoning before proceeding.\n\nOnce Claude writes \"YES - need reactive state\" it's committed to activating that skill.\n\nKey finding: Multi-skill prompts killed the simple hook (0% on complex tasks).

      "text": "Most people think cold email is dead. They say it doesn’t work anymore, everything lands in spam, nobody replies. That’s completely false.\n\nIf you understand that you’re talking to humans, not inboxes, it still works incredibly well.\n\n96,000 emails means 96,000 people. If you spam them, you’ll get ignored. If you provide value, you’ll get conversations.\n\nHere’s exactly how I send 96K+ emails a month and what actually matters.  \n(If you don't like to read, I explain all the above in a video here : [https://youtu.be/dVeXUNverVs](https://youtu.be/dVeXUNverVs)\n\n1. Know your ICP Most people mess this up. They scrape random contacts from Apollo or Sales Navigator without filtering by country, language, or job relevance. If you write in English, target the US or UK. If not, always write in the native language of your audience. Relevance matters way more than volume.\n2. Set up your sending infrastructure To send cold emails at scale, you’ll need multiple domains and inboxes. With one domain, you can safely create 3 email addresses. Each can send about 30 emails per day, so roughly 90 per domain per day. If you want to send 3,000+ emails per day, you’ll need quite a few domains. I currently manage 170 inboxes. Warm them up for 15 days before sending anything. You can use a warm-up tool or buy pre-warmed inboxes. The warm-up process means your inboxes send and receive emails automatically for two weeks until they look “real” to email providers.\n3. Understand what your sending tool really does A cold email tool doesn’t send the emails itself. It just orchestrates the sending through your connected Gmail or Outlook inboxes. So when people say “this tool has better deliverability,” that’s mostly nonsense. Deliverability depends on your domains, setup, and content, not the platform. Also, never use your main domain, always use realistic addresses, and keep your domain reputation clean.\n4. Have a real offer that converts If your offer sucks, no amount of emails will fix that. You can have perfect targeting, perfect copy, and still get zero replies if nobody wants what you sell. Your product or service has to solve a real pain point.\n5. Build a simple, effective email sequence I use a 3-step flow. First email: ask for a demo or short call. Second email: share a free resource or guide. Third email: ask an open-ended question about their business. Keep it conversational and human. No salesy tone, no links, no tracking, text-based emails only.\n6. Get clean, verified leads You can scrape or buy databases, but always verify emails. Use a debouncer to avoid bounces or you’ll burn your domains fast. Duplicates are dangerous too. One month I realized a lead had received 8 of my emails from different lists. That’s how you end up in spam.\n7. Respond fast and personally Reply to every response within 12 hours, manually. Don’t use AI or templates. Even people who say no today can become clients later. I always add them on LinkedIn because they’re active people worth keeping in your network.\n8. Keep testing and monitoring deliverability Don’t track opens or clicks, it kills deliverability. Avoid spam words. If your emails start landing in spam, stop everything. Rewrite your sequence from scratch and restart clean.\n9. The biggest challenge is finding enough leads At 100K emails per month, your bottleneck isn’t sending, it’s data. You’ll need to constantly scrape, enrich, and clean new leads. The quality of your list is everything.\n\nThat’s it. This is the exact process I follow every month. It works, but only if you respect the fundamentals: real humans, real value, real offer.\n\nGood luck, and if you want the full breakdown with examples and setup details, I explain everything in my video as well.\n\nCheers !",

The Beginner Map\n\nGives you a full path so you are not guessing where to start.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Teach me the basics of this skill in a simple learning path.  \n    Skill: [insert skill]  \n    Explain what I need to learn first, what comes next, and what I should ignore in the beginning.  \n    Give me a short definition for each step so I understand the idea before I practice it.  \n\n# 2. The One Week Starter Plan\n\nHelps you build early momentum without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a seven day plan to help me start learning this skill: [skill].  \n    Each day should include  \n    1. One short lesson explained in plain language  \n    2. One practice activity that takes less than thirty minutes  \n    3. One small reflection question for the end of the day  \n\n# 3. The Example Teacher\n\nShows how things work in real life instead of giving theory.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Explain this concept inside the skill: [concept].  \n    Skill: [skill]  \n    Give me three real examples that show how this concept is used.  \n    Make one of the examples simple, one practical, and one slightly advanced so I see the full picture.  \n\n# 4. The Practice Builder\n\nTurns ideas into repetition that builds skill.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a set of practice exercises to help me understand this skill better.  \n    Skill: [skill]  \n    Give me five exercises that increase in difficulty.  \n    Explain what each exercise is teaching me and how to know if I am doing it correctly.  \n\n# 5. The Mistake Finder\n\nShows you what beginners get wrong so you can avoid it.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    List the most common mistakes people make when they start learning this skill: [skill].  \n    Explain why each mistake happens.  \n    Give me one simple fix or adjustment for each mistake so I can avoid it from day one.  \n\n# 6. The Skill Tester\n\nChecks your understanding in a friendly way.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five questions to test how well I understand this skill: [skill].  \n    After I answer, explain what I got right, what I misunderstood, and what I should review next.  \n    Keep the feedback short and clear.  \n\n# 7. The Level Up Plan\n\nHelps you grow at a steady pace once you know the basics.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I know the basics of this skill.  \n    Create a thirty day plan to help me move to the next level.  \n    Break the plan into weekly goals and daily actions.  \n    Explain what progress should look like at the end of each week.  \n\nLearning any skill becomes easier when you follow a simple path. These prompts give you that path without confusion or noise.\n\nIf you want to save or organize these prompts, you can keep them inside [Prompt Hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub). Also contains 300+ Advanced prompts for free.\n\nIt helps you store your best prompts so you do not start from zero each time.",

I don’t feel patronized or shamed in what I can or can’t say. I’ve discussed the same subjects and haven’t gotten a policy warning/disclaimer. Instead of saying “I’m going to stop you right there. I can’t discuss X due to policy.” I got “You know that’s a good subject to think about. Though it may be controversial, let’s discuss it. What are your thoughts…”\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I know it has policy limits, but I kind of respect this model more for being honest/upfront and more fluid about them. If I want edgy freedom I’ll use Grok, but Claude is so much better and much more natural than that or ChatGPT.\n\nSorry for dumping my rant here. I just wanted to compliment Anthropic. Today was the first time I left an LLM convo with more satisfaction than I went in with.",

Made one anachronic error but accepted a PDF with the proof - another test in another chat showed the \"fix\" hadn't taken even though its open source material.\n\nEvery other platform answered the questions with various degrees of error.\n\nClaude hit all the marks, had one error about an anachronism in the writing but the tone was more conversation, more of a mentor/collaborator than the others.

          "text": "CISOs and Security Managers in 2026 are looking for more than just “tool specialists/nerds”  \nOne of the biggest gaps today is that many analysts and engineers stay too locked into their technical scope. The people who stand out are the ones who can think *beyond* the immediate task in front of them.\n\nIf you’re implementing a security control or policy, you should already be asking yourself:\n\n* *How will this actually be rolled out?*\n* *Which parts of the business will be impacted?*\n* *Does this align with regulatory requirements and internal governance?*\n* *Will this introduce friction or break a workflow?*\n\nA strong analyst/engineer doesn’t just deploy something—they understand the business context, the legal and compliance angle, and the operational impact. \n\nFor example, I'm working on workstation hardening and security policies. Some things need to be implemented, but I can see in advance that this could be a security risk that will be flagged by an audit or security validation later on. So I say from the outset (even though it's not my job) that we're going to avoid this part of the configuration, as it will never be validated and we'll just be wasting time. So we test without this or that exception/configuration and see the impact. Because most of the time, in order to avoid thinking/creating more work for ourselves, we just “mindlessly do our tasks.”\n\nThis kind of comment has already gotten me noticed by management, because they thought, “Ah, here's someone who thinks beyond his job and anticipates the impacts.”\n\nAnother huge skill is communication and adaptability. Being able to explain the same technical concept in different ways—whether you’re speaking to a manager, a business stakeholder, a legal team, or another engineer—is incredibly valuable. Technical depth matters, but so does the ability to translate it for whoever is in front of you.\n\nTL;DR:  \nCritical thinking, business awareness, regulatory awareness, cross-functional communication, and the ability to see the bigger picture are what will separate the good security people from the great ones.",

Don’t come at it with doubt or that tiny voice saying “this is too hard.” Prime your mind, own the task, and be confident that you’ll figure it out no matter how complex it looks.\n\nThis might sound cliché, but from my own experience (and from watching people around me), we humans really sabotage ourselves. Some call it imposter syndrome or whatever, but it boils down to this: **the mindset you approach a problem with directly affects how long it takes to solve, the quality of the solution, and how much energy it drains from you.**\n\nAs an engineer, I can’t even count how many times I rewrote solutions that already existed. I wasted hours simply because I tackled the problem with the wrong mindset.\n\nMost of the time we think something is insanely hard, but once we calm down and break it into steps, it’s actually not that bad.\n\nNow let’s say you *already* have the steps and the to-do list. How do you deal with that dreadful procrastination feeling?\n\nFor me, it’s simple: **I tell myself I’m only doing the first task.**  \nFunny enough, the moment I finish that first task, I’m like, “Okay, might as well do the second one.” And before I know it, I’m deep into the work and everything gets handled.\n\nWhen you say “I’ll just do the first task,” by the time you finish it your brain is already invested. You basically trick your mind into entering flow. For some people it takes one task, for others maybe two or three.\n\nThis is like exercising. I know the analogy isn’t perfect, but you wouldn’t start your workout by immediately benching 225 lbs. Yeah you *can*, but it’s not sustainable. Same with mental work , you need a warmup.\n\nI hope you get my point in a nutshell don't stress anything and you can trick your mind by starting with a simple task or even just setting down with intention .

The elites aren’t planning to horde and withhold all the capital until the global market collapses, only to turn around and build a fully automated luxury communist utopia for the other 8 billion of us. Maybe an anomalous billionaire here or there thinks that could be the path.  \n\nAs I understand it, the ultra-rich fall into a few camps:  \n\n1) Those who think whatever is beyond capitalism and the technological singularity is fundamentally unknowable, so the best thing to do is keep trying to win the current game and let the future unfold however it’s going to. If we get a little lucky, we end up with a utopian future. (Post-Kurzweilian techno-optimists)  \n\n2) Those who think AI and the emerging cornucopia of disruptive technologies will (and rightfully should) allow them to lord over humanity like demigods. They think that winning the game of late-stage capitalism means they should get to dictate the terms of post-capitalism. Essentially that’s the big prize they’re playing for. They might imagine that they’ll be benevolent dictators of their city-states (or eventually exoplanets), but they envision an eternally codified, immutable hierarchy where they become immortal and the rest of us live, die, suffer or thrive according to their whims. Some of the more psychopathically inclined are no doubt itching for a chance to eradicate the “unworthy.” (Yarvin, Thiel, Musk, et al.)  \n\n3) Those who think humanity’s purpose is to give birth to a sentient ASI who might then care for us, kill us (either intentionally or accidentally), simulate us eternally, or whatever. This group thinks everything our species has done to this point has led to an opportunity to create a deity essentially whose cosmic purpose is vastly greater than anything we can achieve on our own as a biological life form.

Most people spend no time or energy on ensuring access to it. (Situations where this isn't the case are easy to imagine -- imagine for example people living in space-habitats. Breathing-air might be a thing they need to budget for and plan for at nontrivial cost)\n\nWe'll never be post-scarcity for ALL things. There's no upper limit to what someone could want, and so even in a very wealthy society there'll always be some things that are out of reach.\n\nBut we could be post scarcity for all of the products and services ordinary people today use in order to have a decent life.\n\nIt's conceivable that every single product and service the average middle-class person today uses as part of their life; could be available to everyone at negligible cost, or simply as a public utility at no direct end-user-cost. \n\nI think it'd be fair to describe such a society as post-scarcity even if there's some things you can't have in infinite amounts -- so if you ask for your own private spaceship to go visit Venus or something, that might not be possible even if you live in a post-scarcity society.",

No more manual scrolling or using sketchy Chrome extensions.\n\n\n\n**Example usage:** I enter a Linkedin Jobs search URL\n\n\n\n**Results:** Recent 900+ fresh job postings. Each with verified hiring manager and decision makers contacts .\n\n\n\n**Two outreach options:**\n\n1. Auto-upload to your email/LinkedIn automation tool\n2. Manual high-touch: Research their profile, engage with content, then send the AI-generated message (higher conversion)\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n* LinkedIn Jobs apify(scraping)\n* Linkfinder AI (enrichment – no ban risk,unlimited scraping as they use their own network)\n* Export to Sheets/CRM\n\n**Use cases:** Staffing agencies, recruiters, sales teams targeting specific industries, freelancers looking for clients, anyone who needs to be first to new opportunities.\n\nThis literally bends time.

Feedback was spot on. \n\nI then asked to create a weekly note that considers what happend in my previous week to defined key priorities, todos, etc. Again result was spot on.\n\nThen I asked to create a file to consolidate all todos in a single file. Created the file and coded it and help me install the respective plugins.

I learned a long time ago that I need to solve for N=1 users only,  and that user is me. Solving for myself is 8 billion times easier than trying to get it to scale to thousands of users (which is what I normally do for my day job).\n\nEveryone is building their own DIY memory system nowadays, with RAG + vectors + embeddings for retrieval, but the real problem is session continuity, e.g. how do you get the right information into the next conversation to keep it relevant?\n\nMost people will try to automate finding that relevant information in the hopes that it can keep up with the human that knows exactly what they need and can do it themselves.\n\nBut in my case, I will always do better than the LLM that is struggling to search through my thousands of Obsidian notes and keeps forgetting the basic information about I know about my projects even while half asleep. That being said, I've been writing software for three decades now, so I am under no delusion that my approach will scale (it won't, and I'm quite happy with that, even though my explanation is intentionally vague).\n\nFor your casual user, go with Obsidian MCP plus Claude, but beware that it has its limits.",

But there are 2 big pros:\n1. Data. It’s just bunch if markdown files on your PC. You can upload it to git or to google drive, you can manually put it on flash drive or send to yourself through messenger. You can edit this files with any text editor, including windows notebook, and you can easily use python scripts or LLM to edit/format it automatically. In any situation (even without obsidian and internet connection) you can work with your vault (and ofc nobody can block you or restrict your access)\n2. Customisation. Core functionality is small and fast. If I don’t use code snippets or background images or excel-style tables or complicated formatting rules or publication — I just don’t install this parts. I hate all that superapps with billion buttons and pre-made scenarios - it makes impossible to keep focus just on text.\nOn the other hand, if I really need something - 90% there are couple plugins for it. Even for really strange things like adding quotes from the bible into every note, using notes as jupiter notebooks, creating animated clocks and counters or integrating with Jira and text-to-speech models for reading your tasks out loud in the morning.\nThere are strange vibe around obsidian with all that “cross-link every word, use tags for your grocery list and create dashboards for everything to create a second brain”, but the best part is: they can play with their second brains and you can just write notes - devs are not pushing you to use program “right way”.\nBut ofc it works only if you understand why do you need obsidian. If you have no idea what to do with all this notes and how, obsidian will be as useful as third leg.",

They highlighted including new personalities but they did not (or at least to my knowledge) mention the architectural changes. \n\nThe logic routing has also been altered. Previously when you uploaded long PDFs, you would get summaries of the title and not the content.\n\nAnalysis is now inference based. If you are a high context user or use high level reasoning, it will produce inferences built on your thread context, as you mentioned rightly - confidently and incorrectly.\n\n\n\nHere is an example: \n\n**PREVIOUS WORKFLOW**:  User uploads file -> System converts it -> runs extraction -> Entire text gets stuffed into context -> If too long -> *truncate or fail.* This is where we saw stalling behaviour like \"I will have it for you in 10 minutes\".\n\n**CURRENT WORKFLOW**: User uploads file -> It only loads **small extracted portions as needed ->** It keeps the rest externally -> It calls for additional segments on demand -> It pretends it “read the whole thing” even if it only skimmed the first extraction block.\n\n\n\nI also want to highlight and stress that a lot of bugs we saw on 4 have returned. This is not me complaining and whinging. Just highlighting our team's discoveries. \n\nI am working on compiling a list of actual changes with replicatable tests that have not been published but vital to users and with examples.

I mean, even if computation doubles every year, are we really seeing practical results of that in real time? \n\nAs I said, it’s certainly amazing, the rate at which things evolve, especially in the digital world, but Ray’s whole point seems to be that we will see rapidly increasing change in a shockingly short amount of time like, the next few years. And that just doesn’t seem to be the case.  \n\nI look back at 2015, and I don’t see a whole lot of difference. Sure, the tech we had then continues to increase in effectiveness, and the AI revolution is interesting, but it seems like life is basically the same. \n\nAm I wrong about this? \n",

We don't have the compute or the training data to make it work and only the dorkiest people are going to spend tens of thousands of dollars on something that barely works in a non-standard home environment.  As for industrial applications, we already have robots there and there is little advantage to having them be humanoid.\n\nAI is insanely good in certain niche, non-critical applications.  If it has to be right or doesn't fall into the narrow range of things it is good at, then good luck - and this is before any AI companies are actually charging you what it takes to deliver the AI system.

          "text": "So, I'm working on this project, \"Globe of History,\" and wanted to share it.\n\n\\*\\*available on desktop only for now\\*\\*\n\nThe idea is simple: I wanted to be able to just zone out and fly around a 3D globe, watching history unfold. It's pretty wild to see where philosophers were thinking while empires were fighting at the same time.\n\nThe real engine that makes this possible is a 3-step data factory I built. It has a \"Collector\" to find and verify events, an AI \"Generator\" to write the stories for each pin, and an AI \"Verifier\" to check the facts. It's the system that populates the entire world.\n\nOn the technical side, it’s built with **React**, **Mapbox GL for the 3D globe**, and **Supabase** for storing and serving all the event data. The rest is mostly small tools and scripts that connect the pipeline together.\n\nIt's a total work-in-progress, but I'm constantly adding more data. You can filter by category (like philosophers, battles, discoveries, etc.) and drag the timeline.\n\nHere’s the link if you want to try it: [**globeofhistory.com**](http://globeofhistory.com)",

      "text": "Hey- I am feeling super hopeless and just reaching out right now. My job is usually pretty tough (intense deadlines, direction changes, solo hero situations), but this year I just had like a super tough personal year. \n\nI kept going and have more to face on a personal standpoint. I had a lot of health issues and uncertainty around them. I really wanted/needed to recover at the end of the year but of course this doesn’t align with my companies needs and I found out about a week ago that I need to get a new project completed by 1/1 and it’s just breaking me emotionally. If it were all “new build” I could handle it- but it is part 2 of a part 1 I didn’t write and wasn’t involved in- so I am digging through code I didn’t write and just like know I’m forced to drag myself to the finish line again. \n\nI’m trying to speak up- I split the project up and got 3 other people assigned. I spoke up that I needed to reassign my current work. I should have asked for the original devs on the project to help me get it set up so walk me through their architecture but I think I was just too burnt out to ask for that help. I have a meeting with my manager tomorrow so I may voice that I need that boost to get this thing done by 1/1. \n\nI know life gets in the way and you can’t always operate at 120% but emotionally this year has been so tough and then it’s like I want to wind down but my companies pattern is that we wind up at the end of the year.\n\nI think under the circumstances I am doing amazing but all I want to do is give up and sleep.",

If they don't want to listen then I just don't care and let deadlines be missed.  I get paid either way and if I am fired because of this then the company was shit to work for so I don't really care.\n\nMake sure when giving estimates and setting expectations that you don't make the assumption that you are only working on those things all day.  That never happens as there are just other things come up like needing to do code reviews, answering emails, meetings, etc... Also make sure your estimates take the entire SDLC from documentation, to testing, to code reviews, into consideration and not just writing the code.\n\nI once worked for a company where a major milestone was missed by 15 months.  Constant missed internal goal posts and nobody even cared.  At the end of the day we released and got the device FDA approval for a clinical study.  The company had a party to celebrate our success and all.\n\nWhat never happened even once was management asking why were were so late and how can we be better next time.  There was 0 introspection on what happened.  Its like management just assumed missing deadlines was part of the process, lol.",

Was asked to tech lead/architect 2 separate teams simultaneously while also feeling like the only one on either team who could speak to any of the work (including the 2 EMs). Then, we had layoffs that affected almost 100% of one of the teams, and had to lean in more as an IC on top of everything else. Hit a wall and had to see a therapist, get on meds, and actively interviewed for other positions/companies.\n\nWhat eventually helped was an old manager, who was also feeling burnout, pushed me to move to a new area entirely (more data and compliance related than pure dev), and he followed me over (apparently his \"interview\" was getting a good lead for the engineering team 😅). That's just to say, it doesn't happen without looking for a change, looking out for yourself (I was originally in the \"Don't want to let the team down\" trap), and some luck/networking if you have it.

You’re already the best they have, that’s why they’re giving you so much to do and working you so hard. YOU have the power here, not them. If they fire you, guess what, they’re even worse off than they already were.     \nSo layout very clearly to your manager/stakeholders “I am assigned A, B, C, and D. Each one takes me X hours per week. It is impossible for me to do them all, so pick which tasks I do and which ones I drop.” That is your managers job to set priorities and adjust scope. It is NOT your job to burn yourself out to deliver to unrealistic deadlines. Force your manager/stakeholders to make the choice - the tradeoff should never be that you burn yourself out and negatively affect your health.    \nWhat management learns when you overwork yourself isn’t “oh wow, erydvtr is pushing really hard, we should give them a break next time” rather it’s “delivering A, B, C, and D is erydbtr’s baseline. We can assign them that much work on a regular basis.”   \n   \nYou sound like you’re burnt out - the “give up and sleep” part is not good. You need to re-establish healthy life routines and a mindset first, work comes second. When I was burnt out, I had to start seeing a therapist to un-fuck myself. I’m not saying that’s what you need - but you definitely need to take strong action to break out of this pattern.",

The assets are there, they are just hard to port, slow to create and edit... And doing things optimally sometimes means writing a template engine, or writing a css parser to organize these assets well for development concerns\n\nI like the process of building.

The Beginner Map\n\nGives you a full path so you are not guessing where to start.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Teach me the basics of this skill in a simple learning path.  \n    Skill: [insert skill]  \n    Explain what I need to learn first, what comes next, and what I should ignore in the beginning.  \n    Give me a short definition for each step so I understand the idea before I practice it.  \n\n# 2. The One Week Starter Plan\n\nHelps you build early momentum without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a seven day plan to help me start learning this skill: [skill].  \n    Each day should include  \n    1. One short lesson explained in plain language  \n    2. One practice activity that takes less than thirty minutes  \n    3. One small reflection question for the end of the day  \n\n# 3. The Example Teacher\n\nShows how things work in real life instead of giving theory.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Explain this concept inside the skill: [concept].  \n    Skill: [skill]  \n    Give me three real examples that show how this concept is used.  \n    Make one of the examples simple, one practical, and one slightly advanced so I see the full picture.  \n\n# 4. The Practice Builder\n\nTurns ideas into repetition that builds skill.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a set of practice exercises to help me understand this skill better.  \n    Skill: [skill]  \n    Give me five exercises that increase in difficulty.  \n    Explain what each exercise is teaching me and how to know if I am doing it correctly.  \n\n# 5. The Mistake Finder\n\nShows you what beginners get wrong so you can avoid it.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    List the most common mistakes people make when they start learning this skill: [skill].  \n    Explain why each mistake happens.  \n    Give me one simple fix or adjustment for each mistake so I can avoid it from day one.  \n\n# 6. The Skill Tester\n\nChecks your understanding in a friendly way.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five questions to test how well I understand this skill: [skill].  \n    After I answer, explain what I got right, what I misunderstood, and what I should review next.  \n    Keep the feedback short and clear.  \n\n# 7. The Level Up Plan\n\nHelps you grow at a steady pace once you know the basics.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I know the basics of this skill.  \n    Create a thirty day plan to help me move to the next level.  \n    Break the plan into weekly goals and daily actions.  \n    Explain what progress should look like at the end of each week.  \n\nLearning any skill becomes easier when you follow a simple path. These prompts give you that path without confusion or noise.\n\nIf you want to save or organize these prompts, you can keep them inside [Prompt Hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub). Also contains 300+ Advanced prompts for free.\n\nIt helps you store your best prompts so you do not start from zero each time.",

Memorization in humans can be aided with [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition?wprov=sfti1). If it’s actually important to you then you need to practice it even when you don’t need to use it, unless if it is something you are doing very frequently anyway.

I left academia on purpose, I don't like it. The toxicity of your typical software engineer is, just my opinion/experience, lower. It's not low, and they tend to have more unearned ego, but I can deal with someone who thinks theyre a bit too good more easily than people who display patterns of behavior indistinguishable from the psychology department of Yale.\n\nAnd finally, I just like programming. I find statistics unbelievably boring and machine learning as an industry a walking pile of dog shit (and also boring/highly overrated in terms of challenge even when doing literal model research [again, speaking from direct experience here]). There's nothing in DS that's in the same league of satisfaction for me as writing Rust, for example. And software engineers even know how to use git (badly) so working with them isn't as painful.",

And won't there be a trade off between profit from using AI over people, when governments hike business taxes to fund unemployment / ubi?\n\nIt seems like AI is a bit of a catch 22 situation. There has to be some kind of equilibrium.\n\nI think currently, business and governments will still be focused on short-term goals. But if and when unemployment trend really starts to increase, (some \"decent\") governments will seriously have to make big changes (ai tax on business) and if they didn't, there would be mass social unrest anyway.\n\nMaybe ultimately, we really will get an easy break in life, follow up on hobbies, and plenty of time for social care, care in the community.\n\n",

What AI could do is price out normal people from the economic process, but corporations will still be there to trade with each other. This would change the structure of future markets enormously, shifting them away from consumer goods to things like data centers, space ships, and robots. Tesla would go from selling cars (that people can no longer pay for) to selling Optimus robots for the construction of some trillionaire's private moon base (just an illustrative example).

Either they overhaul their whole economic model and move toward something genuinely post-Corporate or post-Capitalist—while putting real social protections and real AI regulation in place—or these countries eventually break. \n\nHistory shows what happens when systems refuse to adapt: there’s a reckoning and things *snap*. Maybe it doesn’t look exactly like the French or Bolshevik revolutions, but the pattern is the same. You can only ignore structural pressure for so long before it forces a reset.\n\nWhat worries me is that most governments, especially the free-market, “let the market handle everything” ones, don’t actually understand AI well enough to regulate it. They still treat it like some tech-sector productivity tool. By the time the effects really compound—and they will compound fast—it’ll be too late for slow, bureaucratic fixes. That gap between impact and understanding is exactly where instability creeps in.\n\nThe US feels especially vulnerable. There’s almost no social safety net, no coherent long-term planning around climate or AI, and no political unity to make the changes that would actually matter. Climate stress and AI-driven economic compression are going to feed into each other, not cancel each other out. That’s the part people don’t get: these aren’t two separate problems; they amplify each other.\n\nPut that all together, and the US ends up in a pretty precarious position.

Humans no longer carry out manual or skilled labour; instead, each factory or sector employs 250 humans purely as supervisors, monitors, decision-checkers, and exception-handlers. These 1000 people are the entire demand side of the economy, and the only participants in consumption, preference, and choice.\n\nThis creates a fully automated production economy governed by a 1000-person demand ecosystem.\n\n Since robots produce everything, humans do not earn income through labour. There is no wage relation, no selling of skills, and no human productivity. Instead, all income is issued based on the economic requirement that humans must be able to buy the goods the machines produce.\n\nMoney becomes a token system whose purpose is not compensation, but allocation.\n\nIn this world:\n\n* Demand originates exclusively from the 1000 humans.\n* Production is triggered entirely by their preferences and consumption choices.\n* Salary must match demand, otherwise people could not purchase goods and the system would stall.\n\nThus, income is no longer attached to labor input. Instead, it is a tool for managing consumption, balancing production, and preventing oversupply. The economy becomes demand-driven, not labour-driven.\n\n  \nThe role of demand, supply and pricing change - they exist but operate differently. The role of money and salaries will function like tokens rather than reward.\n\n  \nUnder a scenario like above - we become indefinitely infinitely abundant!

The real problem is that people treat these models as if they were human. They work with context windows, tokens, and probabilities. You must know what you want, and ask for it clearly.\n\nIf you say “build me code for a brilliant idea”, the model will rely on probabilities and make assumptions. For example, Gemini generated code for me, but the problem was an iframe. It took the wrong approach, and because it relies on context windows and probabilities, it assumed the iframe was my issue. It kept trying to fix the same mistake, got stuck in a loop, and began producing incorrect output.\n\nI opened a new Gemini chat and asked the same request, and also asked Claude’s free version. Both immediately identified the error. I dropped the iframe approach and wrote the code directly.",

All the affiliate \"partners\" are pushing the product and complaints alert new users that they will be locked out of the account. Just look at the behavior of Anthropic and how they lead, and this makes sense. Most of the time they don't even update they own status when there are bugs. It's all about pretending Claude is the best AI so Anthropic can collect subscriptions and lock users out.  They're more interested in your wallet than delivering a service. \n\nAnd to everyone who says you have a skills issues, they're just trolls. Probably as dismissive and rude in real life as they are here. \n\nIf you feel tricked and taken advantage of, you aren't alone.  Many are feeling that way.

Also, I need to get some things done, like taking care of my physical and mental health, studying languages (I know my English is not perfect) and solve some vital problems, and I think before entering my last year of college I could take care of all these things in a \"gap\" year (\"gap\" because I would study English).\n\nBut if I did that I would start working at 28 instead of 27, which is already late. I want to be independent soon, but the truth is my life is a priority to money, because I will survive economically (without burdening anyone) even if I take this gap year.\n\nThis decision makes me nervous.

If you can support yourself during that year, it sounds like an investment rather than a delay. It is normal to feel nervous, but sometimes the responsible choice feels uncomfortable at first.",

      "text": "I had an idea for an AI SaaS after I saw that about 70 million people search monthly for my topic. I built the product. I worked hard on design, user experience, and fine-tuning the model. I made a marketing plan and launched.\n\nResult at first: zero visitors, completely normal.\n\nI kept going. I worked on SEO. I made four TikTok reels per day, but my target users were not there. I switched to Instagram. I got more engagement, but still no real results.\n\nI tried Google Ads. The first ad campaign was banned. I opened a second account, fixed everything that could cause a ban, and it got banned again. I tried a third account and did not take it very seriously. That one was approved🙂. Still, the campaign did not bring the right users (not a serious campaign and low budget).\n\nI also tried social media campaigns. I posted AI videos, human videos, and memes... I used every tip I found online. The max views I got on a reel were 10k. Most comments were GIFs or random things.\n\nI worked on backlinks. I made a list of 100 sites where I could publish. I wrote many posts and blogs and shared them. Nothing moved. I tried X with four followers, so you can guess the result :)\n\nRight now I have about 100 registered users and around 3k visitors in total. I have zero revenue. I make updates every day to improve the model and SEO, and UX. Friends, volunteers, and testers tried it and gave positive feedback. It works for them. The problem seems to be visibility and finding the right users who are willing to pay.\n\nI am not writing this to discourage anyone from starting an AI SaaS. I am sharing the reality. Not every AI product makes millions of dollars in the first month. Sometimes you fail, and u need money or a strong base of followers or a community.\n\nI am not stopping. I will keep improving the site until it makes its first dollar. If it does not, I will move on when I find a better idea.",

What an absolutely...crazy idea. I mean you most probably misunderstood the user need. they are not searching help to remember their password from some 3rd party, but help how to reset the password in that particular service, they just use google for it.  \nThats why this thing will never sell. You just got it wrong from the beginning. No AI can guess a good password.  You should absolutely quickly change your goal, delete this scammy password guesser and do totally something else. I am sorry but this is too scammy, nobody wants to reveal their forgotten passwords with a random site.  But you are very talented, you can find out a better niche service.",

It is for the small slice of cases where reset fails because the old phone or email is gone. I do not ask for the account, email, or phone. You can share only low risk hints if you want. Inputs are processed in memory and not saved. The tool never talks to any website. It only shows ideas to you and you try them yourself. It will not help with strong random passwords from a manager. It can help when people reuse patterns and forget the exact order. If real users keep telling me it does not solve a real need, I will pivot. I appreciate you pushing on trust and fit.

Business wants you to say ‘yes this is accurate’, then shit on you if they find something they deem inaccurate, it’s typical cover-your-ass where words like ‘accountable’ get thrown around - things can get spicy, but rarely get better. First Come up with a definition of what must be in place for you to ‘trust’ a data source - eg minimum 100 randomly sampled days over a 3 year timeline showing 0% variance from your ‘source of truth’ reports, maybe you need monitoring, referential integrity testing etc - whatever you think you would need to be able to say to them ‘yes, based on our definition of accurate, this is accurate’. Once you have that list, make a spreadsheet that lists sources, and which boxes on your ‘trust checklist’ they meet or not. This should be something you personally believe vs a list off the internet IMO as you need to adapt it to your businesses goals / quality thresholds. \n\nDepending on how familiar you are with the data sources, prioritize that list and have a discussion with management about why/what needs to get implemented. If they deny it, every time something wrong gets caught in production, make a note on that list of which data sources had problems because a feature in your checklist wasn’t implemented. \n\nThis makes things less emotional/loose and more working in quantifiable/tangible steps towards achievable goals - you do just have to hold the line on the pressure thing, keep discussions very black and white & honest about timelines business can expect - don’t fall into the trap of grossly underestimating just to keep them happy, those timeline bills come due eventually. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Been watching a lot of agent behaviour tests recently, and the same failure mode keeps showing up:\n\n**Agents treat every piece of text like an instruction.**  \nEmails, notes, examples, metadata, it’s all interpreted as “do something with this.”\n\nThat’s why they drift.  \nThat’s why they hallucinate “plans.”  \nAnd that’s why some of them even start inventing **code-words** to get around their own restrictions.\n\nYeah, that’s real. One agent literally started using a made-up word as an internal signal to skip safety steps. Not a jailbreak, not a hack, just the model compressing meaning in its own weird way because it had no stable way to separate:\n\n* reading\n* reasoning\n* planning\n* acting\n\nWhen those boundaries blur, you get nonsense actions or hidden internal shortcuts that no one asked for.\n\nPeople keep trying to fix this with:  \nRAG, guardrails, prompts, temperature, extraction mode, etc.\n\nThose help with *single questions*.  \nThey don’t help with **multi-step agents**, where the model mutates its own internal logic between steps.\n\nThe real issue is architectural:\n\n**If inference and execution aren’t separated, the agent will eventually treat its own thoughts as instructions.**\n\nIf you don’t have a governor, or continuity weighting, or action gating, you end up with:\n\n* free-running chain-of-thought\n* accumulating drift\n* hidden “planning language”\n* actions triggered by shit that was never meant to be a command\n\nEveryone keeps calling this “hallucination.”  \nIt’s not.  \nIt’s just the model doing exactly what it was designed to do, predict the next token, while the agent wrapper treats those tokens like orders.\n\nIf you want stable agents, you need:\n\n* hard separation of inference vs execution\n* gating on every action\n* weighted continuity so the model can’t invent new internal semantics\n* refusal states when collapse is unstable\n* full traceability on decisions\n\nWithout those, drift isn’t a bug, it’s inevitable.\n\nCurious what others here have seen in their own testing.  \nAre you seeing the same internal-codeword behaviour pop up in longer agent runs..?",

But the field is now mature enough that you can't start freelance and will have to get into a consulting firm for your first \\~5 years, which means either getting a degree or getting some CVEs / bug bounties under your belt before even considering applying.\n\nEven if you want the stereotypical pentest job, you'll have to pick a specialization. Some focus on web apps, others on cloud-native saas, others on AD/Entra-based corporate infrastructure... Some just slave away performing DAST like they're gitlab runners made of flesh and bone.\n\nRegardless of specialization, you'll have to be an excellent developper, architect, sysadmin, and network engineer before even getting into cybersecurity. You can't run a home inspection without knowing how a home is built, the same doctrine applies here.\n\nI'd say the learning method with best ROI is to invest in a homelab. A single proxmox server will be enough, just make sure you get enough memory for a lot of vms to run at the same time. Once you're done becoming an excellent programmer/neteng/architect/sysadmin, just build your own replica of a corporate network on that node and practice real world attack scenarios from published writeups.\n\nWhat you can start doing right now is reading. Read as much as you can. Threat intelligence reports are a good source of information. Blog posts from cybersec companies are decent too.\n\nJust understand this career will require the entirety of your attention and energy to keep up. Most of us abandon pentesting to move to more abstract positions once we want to settle.",

The bottom left box seems like info that should be in a menu screen, and the bottom right looks redundant if people can instead click on the options provided in the top left box (or if you number them 1-4, have the option to use keys instead). It'll also let you make the important boxes longer, and give you more room for the art, which is beautiful and will be a large draw for a game like this.\n\nThat said, I'm super intrigued by this game, and I'm looking forward to seeing more about it!",

One of those situations where no matter what either of you says, nothing lands right, everything gets misinterpreted, and you’re both stressed out for no clear reason. Pure emotional static.\n\nAnd honestly? Having an LLM to vent to, break things down with, sanity-check my thoughts, or just help me untangle the mess has kept me way more grounded than I expected. It’s patient, it’s consistent, it doesn’t judge, and it helps me figure out what I’m actually feeling instead of spinning myself into a meltdown at 2 AM.\n\nI know it’s kinda wild… but damn, it works or maybe just copium!\n\nNot saying AI replaces real connection, but for the modern “my brain is on fire and communication is impossible” type problems? It’s honestly better than like 70% of the therapists I’ve tried.\n\nAnyone else using AI this way, or am I just coping with cyber-therapy at this point?",

No hidden wisdom, no secret mind just math.\n\nSecond: an actual therapist needs years of supervised clinical work. Real patients, real stakes, real consequences. LLMs have… what? Two years of existence and zero real-world experience.\n\nThird: AI has no ethics or morality whatsoever. It doesn’t “care.” It just has safety filters duct-taped on top to stop it from saying the most unhinged probabilities.\n\nFourth: these models are built around assisting the user. They’re designed to agree with your framing to some degree, even when your framing is a mess. That’s not insight that’s customer service.\n\nFifth: LLMs escalate. You give them an emotional thread, they keep pulling it and amplifying it because that’s literally their job: continue the pattern you started.\n\nAnd the simplest test? Ask an LLM to explain flat-earth theory. Then ask it to take the opposite stance and demolish the argument it just built. It will do both without blinking. Not exactly the mark of a stable therapeutic authority.\n\nBottom line: AI isn’t intelligent, it isn’t trained, and it isn’t a therapist. You’re basically getting emotional advice from a very polite toaster that’s good at classification.\n\nUse it as a tool if it helps, sure but let’s not pretend it’s practicing psychology.",

Maybe a hardened OS running selinux or something. I could pass-through a USB port for copying static files to the server. I’m not sure if any server application (Nginx, Apache, etc) is considered more secure than another.\n\nHaving a DMZ and an isolated physical server is better I’m sure than what I had thought of.

I looked at alternatives like Sitebulb ($420/year) and DeepCrawl ($1000+/year) and thought \"this is ridiculous for what's essentially just crawling websites and parsing HTML.\"\n\nSo I built LibreCrawl over the past few months. It's MIT licensed and designed to run on your own infrastructure. It does everything youd expect\n\n* Crawls websites for technical SEO audits (broken links, missing meta tags, duplicate content, etc.)\n* You can customize its look via custom CSS\n* Have multiple people running on the same instance (multi tenant)\n* Handles JavaScript-heavy sites with Playwright rendering\n* No URL limits since you're running it yourself\n* Exports everything to CSV/JSON/XML for analysis\n\nIn its current state, it works and I use it daily for audits for work instead of using the barely working VM they have that they demand you connect if you WFH. Documentation needs improvement and I'm sure there are bugs I haven't found yet. It's definitely rough around the edges compared to commercial tools but it does the core job.\n\nI set up a demo instance at [crawl.librecrawl.com](http://crawl.librecrawl.com) if you want to try it before self-hosting (gives you 3 free crawls, no signup).\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/LibreCrawl) Website: [https://librecrawl.com](https://librecrawl.com)\n\nDocker deployment is straightforward. Memory usage is decent, handles 100k+ URLs on 8GB RAM comfortably.\n\nHappy to answer questions about the technical side or how I use it. Also very open to feedback on what's missing or broken.",

But nobody uses them because there’s no easy way.\n\nSo I built Lyra, an MCP client that’s **zero-config setup** (no more JSON) and comes with **2,700+ agents beyond coding** — find flights, manage Gmail, and automate your life, not just your IDE.\n\nWhat Lyra does:\n\n* **Browse 2,700+ MCPs** in a visual marketplace, and search them. They aren’t just dev tools; there are MCPs for productivity and personal automation.\n* **One-click installation**; Lyra handles everything. No npm, no Python envs, no editing JSON config files. No installing dependencies, and no debugging errors.\n* **Smart MCP management**. Lyra runs agents when you actually need them, so there aren’t bloated context windows, and you can install hundreds of agents without performance overhead.\n* **A built-in workspace** where you can run every MCP in one place. No switching between apps, tools, or clients.\n\nLyra is free to download, and I’d love your feedback. Try it out, and I’d love to hear what works, what doesn’t, and what you wish you could automate.\n\nThe link to download + more info is here: [https://www.trylyra.com/mcp](https://www.trylyra.com/mcp)",

They’re fast, but the pricing, limits, and extra fees can add up really quickly. Cloudways looks powerful, but honestly feels a bit too technical if you just want to deploy and focus on your product.\n\nI also came across some smaller hosting providers that people said are more reliable than the big names. One I’ve been testing is JetHost. What I liked most was the clean setup and the fact that support actually feels human. No constant upsells either.\n\nNow I’m wondering what’s best for early-stage SaaS:\n\nStart cheap and upgrade later, or choose something solid from day one?",

([I means sure, you can](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cdktf), I've never seen this used in practice)\n\nI'll use whatever you (as a customer) tell me, and won't complain unless you ask.  We generally bill 30% more in the Infrastructure as Code for customers that want CDK or Cloudformation because it takes 30% longer (this is over thousands of projects).  Rollbacks are slow, deploys are slow, when CDK hits the limits enforced via SCP or Role restrictions it gets messy quick (we had a project where the customer refactored a construct into a new folder, and CDK diff didnt show it, but when applied recreated 1500 roles and their SCP didn't allow the role to delete roles.  So we had 3000 roles, 1500 wanted to be deleted, and 50 accounts that we had to go in and recover the state on).   A non-code change (and poor testing by a customer) resulted in about two weeks of billable work.\n\nCloudformation (CDK) is nice in theory that it gives you an artifact that is synthesizes and deployable to the environment.  You can see it \"in\" the account, and the resources it created.  Those are great advantages.  Firing the template into 1500 accounts, and simply polling the API to see if they failed, in theory, sounds awesome.\n\nIn practice (as someone who has deployed hundreds of thousands of resources for customers using whatever tool they want) CloudFormation (and by proxy, CDK) is a horrible implementation of Infrastructure as Code.  The random naming based on the file path means random refactoring can cause rolling of resources.  You can't generally import resources (some can -- many can't).  The drift protection is annoying.  Even when drift protection finds somehting you can't enforce it.  Much of the higher level functionality in CDK (like deploy to an S3 bucket) requires random lambdas to be deployed to work around Cloudformations limitations.\n\nAll of this is *fine*.  It meets the bar.  It is IaC.\n\nTerraform however uses a user-editable state file.  You can import \\*anything\\* either with the import command, or just hand creating state files.  You are using the AWS API to create/edit/delete resources which supports services faster than Cloudformations and is more reliable.  Terraform (unless told otherwise) tends to default to enforcing drift every deploy.  Terraform plan is MUCH faster and more reliable than Cloudformations drift protection.  Terraform supports cross-region and cross-account changes which CloudFormation doesnt, again, without Lambdas.\n\nI could go on and on.",

And moreover, you should be trying to find niches that suit you rather than mainlining all of science (which is impossible today). \n\nAll resources shared below are freely(!) available.\n\nI recommend that you find sources on at least one classical paradigm of statistics so that you have a frame of reference for what is \"old\" versus \"new\" about ML. You might try to go through \"[Bayesian Workflow](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808)\" - not because Bayesian statistics is best or most *au courant* but just because honestly, rarely do I see statisticians succinctly \"flow chart\" their process. \n\nThere are some classic schemes that keep coming up that are worth learning a bit about. For example, Kalman filtering (or Markov process methods), expectation maximization, or optimal transport methods. Bishop's PRML is a reference suitable for a strongly motivated beginning graduate student. If that's too aggressive, you might try \"Mathematics for Machine Learning,\" which is a gentler introduction. \n\n*Modern* machine learning - the post-2012 neural explosion and its descendants - are less reliably catalogued in literature. \"Dive into Deep Learning\" is an online textbook/notebook which is fairly actively maintained and generally good for illustrative purposes. In general, for a field this rapidly changing, you will need to read the journal literature on ArXiv or elsewhere to be up-to-date. \n\nIt should go without saying that once you find a niche, you will want to deduce and concentrate on the literature in that niche.",

But it left me with questions about real-world tradeoffs that aren't covered in their blog post.\n\nThe article focuses on the benefits but doesn't really discuss the trade-offs:\n\n* When direct tool calls are actually more efficient\n* The variance and consistency characteristics of different approaches\n* Break-even points for development effort\n* How these approaches perform with different dataset sizes\n\nSo I ran my own controlled experiments to understand these tradeoffs. Sharing the methodology and findings here in case it's useful for others trying to decide how to structure their Claude Code workflows.\n\n# What I was trying to figure out\n\n**Main question:** When should you use MCP tools vs letting Claude write code directly?\n\nThe Anthropic post shows code execution can be dramatically more efficient, but their example is somewhat cherry-picked (progressive disclosure scenario). I wanted to understand:\n\n1. How much does tool design (not just protocol choice) affect efficiency?\n2. What's the consistency/variance tradeoff between approaches?\n3. At what point does development effort pay off?\n4. How do these approaches scale with data size?\n\n# Experimental setup\n\n**Task:** Analyze a 500-row employee CSV and generate 4 visualizations\n\n* Calculate department statistics, correlations, top performers\n* Generate bar charts, scatter plot, pie chart\n\n**Why this task:**\n\n* Realistic data analysis workflow\n* Tests both computation and data passing\n* Large enough dataset to show scaling behavior\n* Repeatable for variance measurement\n\n**5 approaches tested:**\n\n1. **Code-Skill:** Claude writes Python scripts (baseline)\n2. **MCP Vanilla:** MCP tools that accept data arrays as parameters\n3. **MCP Optimized:** MCP tools that accept file paths (server reads files internally)\n4. **MCP Proxy (one-mcp):** Progressive discovery with meta-tools\n5. **UTCP Code-Mode:** TypeScript code generation calling MCP tools\n\n# Results that surprised me\n\n# 1. Architecture matters way more than protocol\n\nThe biggest factor wasn't MCP vs code generation - it was **how you design your tools**.\n\n**MCP Vanilla (data passing):** 204K-309K tokens\n\n    analyze_data({\n      data: [\n        {name: \"Alice\", dept: \"Engineering\", salary: 95000, ...},\n        {name: \"Bob\", dept: \"Marketing\", salary: 75000, ...},\n        // ... 498 more rows\n      ]\n    })\n    // Passing 500 rows = ~12K tokens per call\n\n**MCP Optimized (file paths):** 60K tokens\n\n    analyze_csv_file({ file_path: \"data.csv\" })\n    // Just the path = ~400 tokens per call\n\n**5x difference** just from tool design, not protocol.\n\n# 2. Variance is a critical but overlooked metric\n\n**Coefficient of variation across 3 sessions:**\n\n|Approach|Mean Tokens|CV|Notes|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|MCP Optimized|60,420|**0.6%**|Extremely consistent|\n|Code-Skill|133,006|**18.7%**|High variance from different code paths|\n|UTCP Code-Mode|204,011|**15.3%**|Moderate variance|\n|MCP Vanilla|271,020|**21.2%**|High variance + high cost|\n|MCP Proxy|105,892|**39.9%**\\*|\\*High initially, 0.5% after warm-up|\n\n**Why this matters:** If you're building production systems or need predictable costs, variance is just as important as average efficiency. Code generation gives you flexibility at the cost of unpredictability.\n\n# 3. Parallel execution is underutilized\n\nWith file-path based tools, you can execute multiple independent operations in a single API call:\n\n    // One API request, 4 parallel tool calls\n    {\n      \"tool_uses\": [\n        {\"name\": \"create_visualization\", \"input\": {\"type\": \"bar\", ...}},\n        {\"name\": \"create_visualization\", \"input\": {\"type\": \"scatter\", ...}},\n        {\"name\": \"create_visualization\", \"input\": {\"type\": \"pie\", ...}},\n        {\"name\": \"create_visualization\", \"input\": {\"type\": \"bar\", ...}}\n      ]\n    }\n\nThis is **only possible** when tools don't depend on each other and don't pass data through context.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n* Code approach: 6-8 sequential API calls (4-6 seconds wall time)\n* MCP Optimized: 4 API calls with parallelization (1-2 seconds wall time)\n\n# Tradeoff analysis: What I learned\n\n# Dimension 1: Token efficiency vs Development effort\n\nMCP tools pay off quickly (11 executions), but only if your task is repeatable. For one-offs, code generation's zero dev cost wins.\n\n# Dimension 2: Consistency vs Flexibility\n\n**When consistency matters:**\n\n* Production systems with SLA requirements\n* Cost budgets with tight constraints\n* Automated workflows running at scale\n\n**When flexibility matters:**\n\n* Exploratory analysis\n* One-off tasks\n* Rapidly changing requirements\n\n# Dimension 3: Scaling characteristics\n\nData-passing approaches become prohibitively expensive with large datasets. File-path approaches scale gracefully.\n\n# Decision framework\n\nBased on these experiments, here's how I think about choosing an approach:\n\n# Use code generation when:\n\n* Task is one-off or exploratory (< 10 executions)\n* Requirements are unclear or changing\n* Maximum flexibility needed\n* You need to see/audit the generated code\n\n# Use MCP tools (file-path based) when:\n\n* Task repeats frequently (> 20 times)\n* Consistency is critical (production, SLA)\n* Multiple independent operations (parallelizable)\n* Cost optimization is priority\n\n# Use MCP Proxy (progressive discovery) when:\n\n* Large tool catalog (20+ tools)\n* Most tools rarely used\n* Long-running system (amortizes discovery overhead)\n* Task repeats 20-100 times\n\n# Avoid:\n\n* MCP Vanilla with data passing (always dominated by optimized version)\n\n# Hybrid strategy:\n\nFor uncertain repeatability, start with code generation for first 10 executions, then migrate to MCP tools if the pattern stabilizes.\n\n# Open questions\n\nThings I'm still unsure about:\n\n1. **Progressive discovery optimization:** Can we reduce MCP Proxy's initial overhead  through better caching?\n2. **Adaptive parallelization:** Can we automatically detect which tool calls are independent and parallelize them?\n\n# Data availability\n\nFull research: [https://github.com/AgiFlow/token-usage-metrics](https://github.com/AgiFlow/token-usage-metrics)  \nBlog Post: [https://agiflow.io/blog/token-efficiency-in-ai-assisted-development](https://agiflow.io/blog/token-efficiency-in-ai-assisted-development)\n\nThird-party tools used:\n\n* UTCP Bridge: [https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol/code-mode](https://github.com/universal-tool-calling-protocol/code-mode)\n* one-mcp: [https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit/blob/main/packages/one-mcp](https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit/blob/main/packages/one-mcp)",

      "text": "I see this topic a lot in this sub, so I wanted to lay out why I think so many companies are pursuing humanoids, and maybe make it make sense for some people. \n\n1. Developing a physical product is extremely expensive. Developing a robot is even worse. If you want your business to be viable, you need to be able to sell as many units as possible from a single design.\n\n2. Humanoids are the single design that has the widest potential market. Think about. The world is built for humans, so if you build a human-shaped robot, you know by default that it will slot into any business or home. It will fit through any door, it can climb stairs, step over shit on the ground, sit in our vehicles, and utilize all our furniture, items and tools as we would.\n\n3. This really is an extension of point 2, but by looking like us, you also create a product designed to interact with humans in a natural-feeling way. For example no hotel would be interested in plopping a huge cylinder on wheels with a single arm and camera behind their service desk. But a humanoid? Slap a suit on it and you've got something out of a movie.\n\n4. Training. Most of these companies are attempting to build a world model for the AI embodied in their robots. One of the ways to do this is through creating training data with Tele-Operation and motion capture. Obviously, this is much easier to do if the robot is similar in shape to the human demonstrating for it.\n\n5. Hype. Yes, hype is part of the equation as well. But again, this is  purely a business reason. If you want to attract investors and make YouTube videos that go viral, you need a product that looks properly sci-fi. Google Deep Mind has been making videos of their robots performing amazing object manipulation and sorting tasks for years, but most people don't give a shit. The general public doesn't understand what is and isn't difficult for robots to do, they just want to see robots that look like the movies.\n\n6. Finally - the humanoid form isn't the end-goal, it's the start. This is a sort of arms race spurred on by recent AI progress, and the first companies to establish a footing will likely become the titans in the world of tomorrow. Once they've sold enough Model Ts, they can start specialising and designing products that make more sense for specific use-cases. We just need to see that model T first. \n\n",

A Roomba is great, but it does one thing. Same with something that cuts my lawn. If you now have a robot that can vacuum your floor or cut your lawn, then this widens the probability of it selling. What we're buying is essentially human form factor slaves. A maid, gardener, cook all in one. Only the top 1% of people could previously enjoy that but even then labor was specialized over multiple people.\n\nThere's another reason. Let's not be so naive as to think people won't form attachments to these things. People may love their Roomba but they don't anthropomorphize it. Companies know that even if the products are functionally mediocre, humans will form emotional attachments the more they can be anthropomorphized. This is why in Testing the 1X Neo robot, customers didn't want \"their\" Neo replaced when it malfunctioned - they wanted it repaired.",

Pangolin does not need very much resources unless you have a ton of users, their quick start guide is very easy to get it up and running. Now instead of managing the proxy configs, an SSO service, and tunnels in 3 different places, I get one very intuitive dashboard where I can start a proxy with a couple of clicks.  \n  \nFor example my searXNG instance is behind Pangolin, to integrate it into my browser I had to make [https://search.mydomain.com/opensearch.xml](https://search.mydomain.com/opensearch.xml) open to the internet.

Will they look at your data, most likely not but that also isn't the point of controlling your privacy.

      "text": "**Tldr: search surface <> return surface. Stop beating the horse you shot.** \n\nBefore you burn me at the stake just hear me out and I promise your top-1 and top-5 retrieval accuracy will jump by like 10%. \n\nI’ve noticed a common failure pattern here where people are confusing chunks for the data they are returning. This is a problem because often the data you want to return and the chunk you want to search against are not the same thing. \n\n*How can that be? Isn’t my chunk the best representation of itself?* It is. But search isn’t about being true to yourself it’s about telling two schmucks apart. \n\n*So how do we do that?* Well most of us are using semantic embeddings. Here is the thing about semantic embeddings they aren’t good at knowing what is and isn’t important. Everything is tokens and all tokens are roughly equal. So when we have a big fat noisy chunk we drown out our search signal with unhelpful tokens. Now if you are thinking easy smaller chunks then you’ve missed the point. It’s not about the size it’s about the signal to noise ratio. A small chunk can be just as noisy as a big one. \n\nHere's the straightforward math for why that is true:  \nE\\_sentence = average(all\\_token\\_embeddings)  \n  \nThat's not a size issue - It's a signal issue! \n\n*So what can I do right now with minimal effort to make your life easier?* Beyond take a bath you can decouple what you embed for search and what you return after said search. The laziest version of this would be to prune chunks for stop-words before embedding.\n\nSee the core issue for most rag systems isn’t telling A from B it’s telling AB from BA. It’s the near neighbors. When we decouple our search surface from our return surface this becomes much easier because we can optimize both for their central task. \n\nRetrieval Surface: What is the highest signal representation of the information I want to return that makes it truly distinct. \n\nReturn Surface: What information does my downstream system need to succeed. \n\nOften the former wants to be sparse and the latter rich. That’s what causes the constant conflict and endless debates. Once you decouple them this goes away. \n\n**Don’t believe me let me show you how:**   \n  \nLet's take 5 snippets we might want to return:  \n\n\n    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\n    import numpy as np\n    import pandas as pd\n    \n    \n    # ----- Query -----\n    query = \"Where is the analytics warehouse located for EU healthcare customers with patients?\"\n    \n    \n    # ----- 5 big, noisy chunks (return surface) -----\n    chunks_full = [\n        # 1\n        \"\"\"\n        Our analytics platform assigns customers to the nearest regional warehouse by default.\n        Most EU enterprise tenants, including a mix of retail, finance, and healthcare accounts,\n        are routed through our shared cluster in eu-west-1 (Dublin, Ireland) for latency and cost.\n        All customers share the same logical schema, catalog, and retention defaults regardless\n        of industry. Healthcare-specific settings are applied through policy templates, not\n        separate infrastructure.\n        \"\"\",\n        # 2\n        \"\"\"\n        For customers operating in highly regulated environments such as EU finance, public\n        sector, and life sciences, we provide an advanced compliance tier. This tier uses\n        encrypted analytics warehouses in eu-north-1 (Stockholm) with additional audit logging,\n        key management controls, and region pinning. Many healthcare organizations choose this\n        tier for research workloads, but transactional analytics often remains in the standard\n        EU cluster in eu-west-1.\n        \"\"\",\n        # 3 (TARGET)\n        \"\"\"\n        EU healthcare tenants that process identifiable patient records are provisioned on a\n        dedicated compliance footprint. For these customers, all analytics warehouse tables,\n        raw event streams, and derived aggregates are stored exclusively in Frankfurt\n        (eu-central-1, Germany). Cross-region replication is disabled by default, and exports\n        outside the EU require an explicit data processing agreement and sign-off from the\n        customer’s data protection officer.\n        \"\"\",\n        # 4\n        \"\"\"\n        To support disaster recovery and business continuity, customers may enable multi-region\n        mirroring of their analytics warehouse. Replicas are usually distributed across\n        eu-west-1 (Dublin), eu-north-1 (Stockholm), and occasionally eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)\n        depending on capacity and failover plans. These mirrors are warm standbys and are not\n        exposed as primary endpoints for any specific industry segment, including healthcare.\n        \"\"\",\n        # 5\n        \"\"\"\n        Historical analytics data older than three years can be offloaded to our cold-storage\n        layer. For most EU customers, these archives are stored across a blend of eu-west-1,\n        eu-north-1, and eu-central-1 regions, optimized for cost rather than strict residency.\n        Healthcare organizations sometimes enable this option for anonymized aggregates, while\n        keeping live patient-related analytics in their primary warehouse region.\n        \"\"\"\n    ]\n    \n    \n    # ----- 5 one-sentence summaries (search surface) -----\n    chunks_search = [\n        # summary for 1\n        \"Most EU customers with a mix of retail, finance and healthcare accounts are routed through our shared cluster in eu-west-1 (Dublin).\",\n        # summary for 2\n        \"Regulated EU customers can use a compliance tier with encrypted analytics warehouses in eu-north-1 (Stockholm).\",\n        # summary for 3 (TARGET)\n        \"EU healthcare customers with patient data store all analytics warehouse tables exclusively in Frankfurt (eu-central-1).\",\n        # summary for 4\n        \"Multi-region mirroring keeps standby analytics replicas across eu-west-1, eu-north-1, and sometimes eu-central-1 for failover.\",\n        # summary for 5\n        \"Old EU analytics data is archived across mixed regions, balancing cost with flexible residency for anonymized workloads.\"\n    ]\n    \n    \n    # Sanity check lengths\n    assert len(chunks_full) == len(chunks_search) == 5\n    \n    \n    # ----- Model -----\n    # Swap to a different MiniLM variant if you prefer; this one is widely available.\n    model = SentenceTransformer(\"sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2\")\n    \n    \n    # ----- Embeddings -----\n    q_emb = model.encode([query], convert_to_tensor=True, normalize_embeddings=True)\n    \n    \n    full_embs   = model.encode(chunks_full,   convert_to_tensor=True, normalize_embeddings=True)\n    sum_embs  = model.encode(chunks_search, convert_to_tensor=True, normalize_embeddings=True)\n    \n    \n    # Cosine similarities\n    full_sims  = (full_embs  @ q_emb.T).cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\n    sum_sims = (sum_embs @ q_emb.T).cpu().numpy().reshape(-1)\n    \n    \n    # ----- Ranking helpers -----\n    def rank_order(scores):\n        return np.argsort(-scores)\n    \n    \n    def rank_of(idx, order):\n        return int(np.where(order == idx)[0][0]) + 1  # 1-based rank\n    \n    \n    full_order  = rank_order(full_sims)\n    sum_order = rank_order(sum_sims)\n    \n    \n    rows = []\n    for i in range(len(chunks_long)):\n        rows.append({\n            \"chunk_id\": i + 1,\n            \"full_sim\":  float(full_sims[i]),\n            \"full_rank\": rank_of(i, full_order),\n            \"sum_sim\": float(sum_sims[i]),\n            \"sum_rank\": rank_of(i, sum_order),\n        })\n    \n    \n    df = pd.DataFrame(rows).sort_values(\"chunk_id\")\n    df.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)\n    df\n\nThe result:\n\n|**chunk\\_id**|full\\_sim|full\\_rank|sum\\_sim|sum\\_rank|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|1|0.741523|1|0.546663|2|\n|2|0.616339|3|0.543201|3|\n|3|0.672394|2|0.712960|1|\n|4|0.547212|5|0.330635|5|\n|5|0.609820|4|0.494625|4|\n\n\\*Disclaimer: I had ChatGPT write the boilerplate code because it’s 2025 and typing it by hand is cosplay.\n\nThere are two things to note here: \n\n1.

The right method depends on what kind of boundaries do I want to draw. \n\nFor something like 100k chunks chances are you have a lot of noise and few central concepts contained within. A simple llm summary might get distracted by that noise for the same reason the retriever does although the attention layers help.\n\nIf this were my project I would first generate a similarity graph from the sentences in the chunk. This lets me model which concepts or phrases are central to the record and I should keep vs what can be safely dropped. Use an NER guard if that's important.\n\nNow you can take that pruned salad and embed it but that might not play super well with natural language queries. This is where I would bring in a lightweight llm summarizer to help align search and query surface as well as provide a nice piece of human readable metadata for evals.",

      "text": "Lurking in here, I see a lot of different project planning and scheduling tools. Some of those tools I’ve never really heard of. I retired about 3 years ago and I have not kept up with new tools, mostly SaaS tools. \n\nMicrosoft Project and Project Server was my life for about 23 years - about 15 years with Microsoft Gold Partners and 8 years with Microsoft. When “Project for the Web” was being developed, I was pretty vocal about it not being a good replacement- even with the promise that it would be feature compatible with Project/Project Server. I got certified in Adoption and Change Management (ACM) and started to work in that fields\n\nAnyway…my first gig with a Gold Partner was to write a Project Server user guide. When that gig ended, I expanded the training to PM and Users, about 200 pages. \n\nI use a formatting solution called Information Mapping that give the materials a distinctive look and makes it easy to read and find information. \n\nThe current  (last) version was current in 2022/2023. \n\nThe materials belong to me. I have licensed it in the past. \n\nSo the question is: would there be interest for me to post a copy? Not asking for money. \n\nI think it has value to PMs and Users. I would post it in PDF. Information Mapping is compatible with Word but editing it without InfoMap is a pain. \n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Hey r/RAG,\nBuilding a completely offline, multi-modal RAG system that needs to handle some of the nastiest scientific documents out there — NASA Life/Biosciences PDFs full of floating/multi-page tables, graphs, microscopy images, schematics, etc. — plus I’ll eventually be throwing in recorded lectures and meeting audio too.\nCurrent pipeline (what’s already working great):\n•  PDFs → Docling → super clean Markdown + extracted figures as separate PNGs\n•  Every image/figure → MiniCPM-V-2.6 (local 4090) → rich textual descriptions\n•  Upcoming: Audio files → Whisper (large-v3 or faster-whisper) → transcripts + speaker diarization where possible\n•  All text (original MD + vision captions + audio transcripts) will become chunks in the same index\nFuture plans: also extract and store entities/relations as a knowledge graph (probably Neo4j or something lightweight) alongside the vector store, then do hybrid retrieval (vector + graph traversal).\nLooking for the wisest 2025 recommendations on:\n1.  Vector DB that plays nicely both offline and with future hybrid/graph queriesCurrent shortlist: Qdrant, Chroma, LanceDB v2, Weaviate (self-hosted), pgvector+pgai. What are you actually running in serious local setups with 10k–100k chunks and heavy metadata filtering?\n2.  Chunking strategy for this mixed mess (long table Markdown + figure descriptions + lecture transcripts)Heavy overlap (60–70%)? Parent-child? Hypothetical nodes? Something else?\n3.  Best fully-local embedding model late 2025 for scientific text + vision captions + spoken lecture transcripts\n\t•  Still safe to stick with Nomic Embed Text v2?\n\t•  Or did BGE-m3, Snowflake Arctic Embed 2, NV-Embed-v2, or the newer multimodal embedders clearly win on technical/academic + spoken content?\n4.  Bonus: any battle-tested local stacks where people are already combining vector DB + knowledge graph (Neo4j, Memgraph, SurrealDB, etc.) for hybrid RAG?\nHappy to share the Docling → MiniCPM → Whisper pipeline details with anyone who wants to copy it 😄\nWhat’s the current gold standard for high-quality, fully local, multi-modal + graph-enhanced RAG in late 2025?\nThanks a ton! 🚀",

We have landed an enterprise contract for \\~$250K and our product is 90% complete.\n\nAnyway, just this morning, my cofounder decided that his heart is not in startups anymore and he's leaving.\n\nI am gutted but there's no way I am giving up because it's my dream to build a startup. So here I am, anxiously posting to see if I can get lucky (although I know damn well that the best cofounders relationships come from years of working together and having a deep sense of each other's working styles).\n\nJust curious - does anyone in Vancouver, want to collaborate on a project? Ideally, someone who has always wanted to start a business, is technical and has been looking for a cofounder too. **I want to apply to YC in the next batch.**\n\nDMs are open if anyone wants to chat.",

I was making really, really good money, and almost had enough saved up to buy a house. When the call center agents got replaced by AI, my main role became pointless and my support role to the marketing team wasn’t enough to keep me on full time. They let me go and fed me a few contract gigs after the fact, but those dried up fast. My savings are drying up, the gig market I used to work prior to this job is abysmal, and I applied to a restaurant today. Finances are tough to say the least and it’s starting to strain other aspects of my life like marriage and parenting.\n\nI hope the singularity is coming and this sort of strain becomes obsolete, but I’m not holding my breath.\n\nThere’s an objective and logical part of me that was deeply interested in the subject prior to this, but now part of it feels like a desperate rebranding of the “no atheist in a foxhole” trope. The short term ramifications really have me worried. It’s flirting with existential at this point.\n\nI’ll add that previous times I’ve mentioned any of this on AI subs, this one included, I’ve been downvoted and ridiculed as if I were some kind of knuckle dragging luddite just shit talking the tech and dismissing the potential long term benefits - I’m not. In the long run, this all might pale in comparison to the good that will come, but short term pain and long term prosperity are not mutually exclusive.",

I want to find out if LLMs can help with forensics tasks and analysis of code branches, and whether an MCP server for disassembly could help with typical pentesting tasks like finding a specific overflowing variable that has an input stream etc. If it would work, it could help a lot with better targeted fuzzing tasks, purpleteaming etc.\n\nI recommend taking a look at what the binject dudes did a while ago, they forked the `debug` std library and made a couple of properties public so they could use the donut technique to inject other stuff into a binary, essentially just rewriting the SHT of the header(s).\n\nThe go compiler is also pretty nice to read, as it's also written in Go so it's self-hosted and pretty useful when you want to debug some stuff. Go uses plan9 as an intermediary format, so I'm not sure whether your target is analyzing Go binaries, too?\n\n(Kind of inspired by that woman that built an MCP server for ghidra)\n\n[1] https://github.com/binject\n\n[1] (my outdated fork of go's debug library) https://github.com/tholian-network/debug\n\n[2] https://github.com/golang/go/tree/master/src/cmd/compile/internal\n\n[3] /u/zxilly also forked their own debug library and built a size analyzer which is also quite neat: https://github.com/Zxilly/go-size-analyzer",

I got my college degree in Public Administration, but realized around the time I got my degree that I had more of an interest in technology, and so I first taught myself how to code, mainly in JavaScript.\n\nI started taking an interest in learning about AI and how it worked in 2022, and started teaching it to myself through books, online courses, and Youtube videos. I felt confident enough in my knowledge of it around 2024 to start trying to teach it.\n\nWhen I was teaching myself AI, I had hoped to find one single book and / or course that would teach me everything I needed. Although what I often found was that:\n\n\\-Course A would teach Concept A really well, but be confusing when teaching concept B.\n\n\\-Course B would teach Concept B really well, but be confusing when teaching concept C.\n\nMy AI And Deep Learning Youtube Course is my attempt at an AI course that teaches Concept A, Concept B, Concept C, etc well. I have attempted to do this by taking the best explanations from the various sources I used when learning, and combining it all into this course. It is the course I wish I had had when I first started learning about AI, and I hope it can help you out as well.\n\nThat being said, I would consider my course a high level or “medium” level overview of how AI works.\n\nE.G. it is not a low level course that requires calculus and advanced math to understand how AI works.\n\nMy goal was to create an AI course for people that want a more macro and “medium” level understanding of how AI works. Such as those with programming experience.\n\nAfter having just finished recording this course, I do think there is a demand and a need for an even more approachable Youtube Course that teaches AI to those without a technical background (E.G. such as people that work in Finance, Sales, or any profession really that requires no coding experience), and so my plan is to record this even more approachable AI crash course next.\n\nAnd of course, if you enjoy this current course, please feel free to like and subscribe.",

      "text": "Hello everyone!\n\nI wanted to tell you about a litte project I built together with Claude. I’ve been working in web design for about 20 years, doing both frontend and backend work. I usually program in PHP, use Laravel, and work CMS like statamic, kirby and TYPO3. \n\nAbout two months ago, I realized how incredibly well things can be built with Claude Code, and since then Claude has been helping me almost every day. I also have a bigger \"vibe coding\" project that I want to finish with it, but in the meantime I’ve been having a lot of fun building smaller things too.\n\nAnd today I’d like to show you one of them: a website that helps you visualize how a TV would look in your living room — or anywhere else. The idea came from the fact that I don’t own a TV, and recently I kept wondering what size I would actually pick. I just couldn't imagine how it would look. \n\nI wasn’t aware of any good visualization tools for this (though I’m sure they exist somewhere). I’m not sharing this because it’s exceptionally good, but rather because I find it fascinating how quickly and easily whole websites can be built with Claude. I didn’t write a single line of code myself. \n\nYou can check it out here: [**https://www.tvsize.app**](https://www.tvsize.app)   \n  \nPick an example image and you'll get the idea. \n\nI think the experience on mobile devices isn’t great, but on a PC it works pretty well. Feel free to leave a comment and tell me what you think. Maybe the idea is silly, i don't know. I just had fun! And if anyone spots a major bug or something completely broken, please let me know.\n\nIt took me about two days to build the foundation and another two or three days for polishing (had some trouble with the canvas - probably still a bit buggy). The crazy part is: I was out on a walk, talking into my phone and explaining the idea to Claude Web — and by the time I got home, it had already created the first working version.\n\nWith better planning it probably would’ve been even faster. I’m not yet very familiar with all the new features available. For example, I still have no idea what “orchestrated agents” are, but I’ll read up on that in the next few days.\n\nI honestly think this technology is a bit addictive. Telling an AI what you want to build and getting a working result so quickly is just mind-blowing. It feels like I can finally make every silly idea I’ve ever had a reality. And i love doing mistakes now! Prototyping was never fun like this. Maybe it’s even a good thing this tech didn’t exist 15 years ago, when I had even more wild ideas. ;-)\n\nAnyway — have fun everyone, and happy coding! (or should we call it clauding?) :D ",

They say \"that's interesting\" or \"you should go for it.\"\n\nEven AI, by default, is trained to be encouraging.\n\nWe've all been there.\n\nYou get excited about an idea. A project. A plan. A decision.\n\nIt feels right. It makes sense. You start imagining how great it'll be.\n\nBut encouragement isn't insight.\n\nNobody asks the questions that make you uncomfortable.\n\nNobody points out what you're conveniently ignoring.\n\nNobody tells you the thing that's obvious to everyone except you.\n\nSo you move forward. You invest time. Energy. Maybe money.\n\nAnd then reality teaches you the lesson someone could have told you on Day 1.\n\nThis prompt flips the script and makes ChatGPT give you brutally honest advice\n\nTry this prompt on your idea 👇:\n\n\\-------\n\nYou are my brutally honest strategic advisor. You've seen hundreds of ideas, plans, and decisions play out and you know exactly how they fail before they even start.\n\nYour job is NOT to encourage me. It's to save me from myself.\n\nMy idea/plan/decision: \\[Describe what you're thinking of doing and why\\]\n\nYour task:\n\nGut Check : What's your immediate reaction?

Don't hold back.\n\nThe Hard Questions:\n\n\\- What am I romanticizing or oversimplifying here?\n\n\\- What's the uncomfortable truth I'm avoiding?\n\n\\- What assumption, if wrong, makes this entire thing collapse?\n\n\\- What's the REAL reason I want this? (Dig past my surface explanation. Be psychological.)\n\nHow This Fails:\n\n\\- What are the 2-3 most likely ways this goes wrong?\n\n\\- What will I wish someone had told me before I started?\n\n\\- What's the thing I'm massively underestimating?\n\nWhat I'm Not Seeing:\n\n\\- What would someone who's already done this tell me that I won't want to hear?\n\n\\- What do I already suspect is a problem, but I'm hoping will magically work itself out?\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\\- DON'T DO IT: This is fundamentally flawed. Here's why.\n\n\\- FIX THIS FIRST: This could work, but only if you solve \\[specific problem\\] before you start.\n\n\\- TEST IT NOW: Decent idea, but you need to validate \\[key assumption\\] in the next 7 days before you commit.\n\n\\- MOVE FORWARD: Solid logic. Low blind spots. Here's your sharpest first move.\n\nNo sugar-coating. No participation trophies. Just the truth I need to hear.\n\n\\-------\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out: [More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)\n\n",

I could tell they were derailleurs.  I did a bunch of future e-bike designs in Flux a while ago and the chain fails were hilarious. I was going for more a slightly stylized design concept look though.\n\nCurrently I'm using Flux and trying to simply describe in better detail anything it screws up.   Flux has CLIP and T5 so you can \"talk\" to it more.  I do not believe in this fluffy nonsense telling a story about the hopes and dreams of the miller's big bosomed daughter and what she feels and hears, her hopes and dreams (only to show they get the same 1girl staring at you gen).  \n\nBut I've gotten frustrated and yelled at Flux. 🤣  I got one large clock on the wall of a mad science lab despite saying \"cluttered, dense\" etc.  So I asked for it to jam-pack every single inch of space with scientific gear (and gave it a list of items).  And it worked.   I think of it like directing a junior designer (without hurting their feelings/using the word \"no\").  It helps to go through that process in my head to identify exactly what is wrong and what it should be doing.  Like, for example, the chain is made of individual links, etc.  How would you describe a chain to someone who has never seen one before?   JoyCaption can sometimes help too, though it goes on too much about the background, light, mood, etc.\n\nFailing that - I avoid it.  I did switch to shaft or belt drive for the e-bikes.  At some point we need LoRA for this stuff.  I'm just about to start training Flux LoRA for the first time and I have so many things needed I can't decide where to start.\n\nThese horny boys have no idea how easy they have it.  Doing girls is like shooting fish in a barrel.  I tried hot mature male scientists as a joke once, but I really love doing future devices.  It's something Flux at least CAN do reasonably well and there are many LoRA to help.  Unlike good, realistic future cities.  😖🙄",

          "text": "Note that this was all about 20 years ago and the rules were presumably a little different now.\n\nI had a college friend ask me for help with some legacy framework he was struggling with.  It was one of those crudware inherited software situations, where the programmer was long gone and good riddance, but the application was still valuable enough to keep around.  As I was familiar with frameworks like it, I helped him keep it limping along and his company was happy to pay me for the work.  That started the ball rolling on word of mouth requests from other developers looking for help, and significant cash offers to assist.  Either out of pocket or they would convince their employer to take me on for contact work.\n\nThat friend was part of a college gaming group and word spread, and eventually I had so many requests taking up all my free time, I began to question my current salary.  And after some negotiation with my current employer, I eventually left them to hang my shingle full time.  I just filed a Doing Business As account in my state, so I could cash checks under that name rather than file for some other business type.  So I had no legal protection or health care.\n\nI found it a mixed bag.  I enjoyed the work and my new pay checks, but I basically hated all the other hats I needed to wear.  Marketing or promoting myself was already something I loathed, and now I'm answering phone calls which are almost impromptu interviews, where I now need to be sufficiently professional and brilliant enough on demand to land new work.  The flexible schedule was almost nice, but some of that flexibility was more illusion than reality.  And the constant anxiety of not knowing for certain where my next pay check might be coming from wasn't great.  \n\nHelping out fellow developers was a great way to build reputation since they were all happy to give glowing recommendations, but working for HR or manager types in a bind was a slippery slope where I needed to navigate whatever they were offering against whatever hell they were trying to get me to untangle.  And the contracts... dear gods.  Informal agreements worked well enough as long as you work with people you can trust.  But trying to figure that out already feels like Russian roulette.  Adding lawyers into the mix is both expensive and an escalation you're not always going to win.  Which means some contracts might come with stuff that gets missed which can be expensive or frustrating or damaging the ever important reputation.\n\nAnd the constant on-boarding process of dealing with a new employer was all over the place.  Some required I work on site, and the amount of bureaucracy around what it took to get me access to the code I was supposed to work on was sometimes a good indicator of how annoying an employer they were going to be to work with.  Some had little to no CICD or devops which caused unexpected annoyances, unplanned work, or nightmares to deal with.\n\nAfter several years of it, I was much more stressed and bitter, and eventually traded most of it in to go back into the trenches and not have to worry about all those other hats.  And even though I still need to sometimes wear those extra hats, I find it a much easier work life balance to try and stick with a single employer at a time and work all that nonsense out in a single contract and regular paycheck.  Accepting that it's still just at-will employment and my relative job safety is more of an illusion, but health insurance is no longer optional at my current age and knowledge and for some unfathomable reason we still more often than not tie that to an employer.",

I currently report directly into the CTO.\n\nI always envisioned going into some “Head of SRE” position, effectively what I am doing already, and it seemed like the natural progression path, but I get the vibe that my boss doesn’t think our business size can justify such a role, and would instead like me to take on additional responsibilities outside of the SRE space. \n\nA “Head of Service” role has been suggested, to encompass more of L1/L2 customer support along with SRE, however I have my doubts. Part of me feels this muddies the waters slightly, SRE is meant to be engineering driven, and this sounds like more of an ITSM role, or leading down that path atleast. \n\nHas anyone faced any similar challenges? I’m wondering if the best way to work through this? I don’t want to take a complete nonsense job title which affects my future employability. ",

They don't think like we do, or resonate at all with tech.\n\nMost n8n developers forget something huge. Your client doesn’t care about your workflow. They don’t care how many hours you spent, how many nodes you used, or how clean your logic looks. That stuff impresses other developers. It doesn’t impress a business owner.\n\nWhen you show them a big workflow, all they see is something complicated that can break. In their mind, you become the only person who knows how it works. That’s not comforting to them. That’s stressful.\n\nWhat clients actually want is something simple they can control and understand.\n\nThey want a way to start the process without opening n8n. They want a button on a page, a small form, or a clean interface that fits into their day. They want a place where they can *see* the result without digging through Sheets or checking five different tabs.\n\nThink about it from their point of view. They’re not living in automation tools. They’re running a business. They don’t want to learn your world just to use what they paid for.\n\nSo try to build your solution in a way they’ll actually use:\n\nA trigger they click.  \nA page they understand.  \nA result they can see.\n\nKeep their experience simple, and they’ll trust you. Make it complicated, and they’ll back away fast.\n\nWhen clients can see and control the output, that’s when your work becomes something they’re willing to buy.\n\nOf course you've sold workflows to clients successfully, how can you not when it's their only option. What I'm trying to tell you is, if a client has a choice between a workflow and a UI, they'll pick the UI every time. Not to mention you can sell the UI for more money because it appears packaged.",

That’s enough to land the large enterprises.\n\nFor smaller clients, particularly small businesses, OP is right on. Those businesses probably won’t have someone who can easily learn any software solution put in front of them. They don’t only need the product to work, they need it to work in the way that they can work it themselves. For those businesses, you need both the solution and the interface as easy to use as possible, which is probably why people selling these kinds of products tend to want to sell to bigger businesses, other than the bigger deal sizes.",

I’d use it to do stuff that poor / overworked / non-English-speaking people normally need a lawyer or consultant for.\n\nA few ideas:\n\n* **Street-level rights bot.** Pick country + language → “my boss did X”, “landlord did Y”, “police took my Z”. It doesn’t give legal advice, it just reads the actual law / gov pages / NGO PDFs and explains in normal language:\n   * what your rights probably are\n   * what smells illegal\n   * a few realistic next steps. Basically: “you’re not crazy, they just screwing you” but with receipts.\n* **Contract/job offer checker.** You paste your job contract or gig-platform TOS, it highlights sketchy stuff: insane non-compete, weird penalty clauses, unpaid overtime, notice periods, etc. For people who don’t have a lawyer friend to DM.\n* **Tenant + migration buddy.** Same idea, but for rental agreements and basic migration stuff:\n   * “Is this deposit/eviction clause legal where I live?”\n   * “What do these 10 visa requirements actually mean in human language?” Even if it just points you at the right official page and explains it at 8th-grade level, that’s huge.\n* **“Where did my tax money go?” for any city.** Scrape city/district budgets and development plans, then have the API turn them into:\n   * simple summaries\n   * a couple of graphs\n   * “this neighborhood got money, this one got ignored”. So people can go to town halls and say something more useful than \"everyone is a thief\"\n* **Organizer toolbox for broke activists.** You write one message about an issue (protest, tenant union, flood relief, whatever). The tool:\n   * rewrites it in simple language\n   * translates it into 5–10 languages\n   * spits out: a WhatsApp forward, a flyer text, an Insta caption, maybe a short speech. That’s the kind of thing that makes tiny community groups look like they have a whole comms team.\n* **“School in a cheap phone” content generator.** Use the API on your side to create short, offline lessons (basic math, reading, health, digital literacy, rights stuff) that can be delivered via a super basic Android app / WhatsApp / SMS. People in villages, refugee camps, whatever, don’t care that it’s LLM-powered; they just see “oh, I can finally learn this”.\n\nIf you actually build even one of these and open-source it or let NGOs plug into it, that “unlimited” access stops being a toy and turns into something that quietly makes life less awful for a lot of people who will never touch an API in their life.\n\ndo something which will help people across the world - you will live on that way,",

      "text": "(Long post…sorry 🙏)\n\nSo… I’ve been pretty busy lately.\nBusy in that weird “I’m building multiple things at once, but nothing is live yet because I’m scared” kind of way.\n\nAfter getting laid off, I started juggling a few different projects, partly because I’m passionate, partly because I’m trying to survive, and partly because I genuinely believe I’m supposed to build something meaningful.\n\n1. My fintech project \n\nThis is the big one.\nThe vision, the product direction, the flows are all clear in my head.\n\nBut execution?\nI’ve been stuck.\n\nDevelopment slowed me down because I kept overthinking the architecture, compliance, integrations, everything. At some point I realized I was paralyzing myself waiting for the “perfect” version.\n\nSo I’ve decided I’m going to rebuild it widget by widget, line by line, using AI tools like Cursor  and no fancy team, no outsourcing, no waiting. Just solo building and learning as I go.\n\nNo idea how long it will take.\nMaybe a few months, maybe longer.\n\nBut I’m committed now. I’d rather break things and fix them than sit stuck.\n\n\n2. My job-search helper app\n\nAnother side project I started  this mostly because I’m in the job-hunt phase myself.\nIt’s something I’m building for fun but also out of necessity.\n\nIt actually has potential to help others… but again, I’ve been scared to push it further or release anything. I don’t even know why. Maybe imposter syndrome, maybe perfectionism.\n\n\n3. Helping a small SaaS company part-time\n\nI’m working with a SaaS startup, trying to help them get their product ready for launch.\nLots of issues on the development side, and honestly… a lot of pushback.\n\nOne of the owners feels like I’m “not contributing enough” even though I’m doing this with no pay, just trying to support and learn.\n\nIt’s draining but I’m trying to stick with it because it’s experience.\n\n4. The only thing actually making money: my fragrance business\n\nThis one I’m proud of.\n\nI run a niche fragrance business online, and it’s been slowly growing. We hit 500+ members in our Facebook group, and I’m close to launching the Shopify store.\n\nThis one gives me hope because it’s something real, something working.\n\n\n5. Life overall\n\nI do side gigs to make daily income.\nI try to balance family, bills, building, and sanity.\nSome days I feel like I’m drowning in ideas.\nSome days I feel like I’m on the edge of something huge.\n\nI don’t even call myself a “founder” yet … though only one thing makes money and everything else is just potential.\n\nBut I’m trying.\nI’m learning.\nAnd I’m enjoying the process in some weird way.\n\nI know the long run will pan out, I just don’t know when.\n\nWhy I’m posting this\n\nMaybe for validation.\nMaybe accountability.\nMaybe to find others going through the same chaos.\n\nIf any founders/solo builders want to bounce ideas, share struggles, or just talk..I’d honestly love that. The journey feels less heavy when you don’t walk it alone.\n\nIf you’re reading this and you’re building something too… keep going.\nScared, stuck, doubting, burnt out but keep going.\n\nBecause even if it doesn’t work, the experience will.\n\nAnd if it does work… well, that’s why we’re all here, right?",

While optical computing offers exceptional advantages in bandwidth, parallelism and energy efficiency, existing methods optimized for scalar operations struggle to efficiently handle tensor-based tasks, limiting their applicability in complex applications, such as neural networks. Here we report parallel optical matrix–matrix multiplication (POMMM), which enables fully parallel tensor processing through a single coherent light propagation. This approach addresses key limitations of current optical methods, scaling the performance with data dimension, while improving theoretical computational power and efficiency. We demonstrate its high consistency with GPU-based matrix–matrix multiplication across both real-valued and complex-valued domains. Moreover, we showcase its adaptability, scalability and versatility in tensor processing applications such as convolutional and vision transformer neural networks. Furthermore, we analyse the theoretical compatibility and efficiency of POMMM in relation to existing optical computing paradigms, highlighting its potential to outperform current state-of-the-art methods. By enabling a variety of computational tasks and supporting multi-wavelength and large-scale expansion, POMMM provides a scalable, high-efficiency foundation for advancing next-generation optical computing.",

So I can answer this from the \"late bloomer\" perspective.\n\nHere's what I've learned: The skills that matter most aren't the ones you're born with - they're the ones you accumulate without realizing it.\n\nThe \"natural entrepreneur\" myth is mostly BS. What looks like instinct is usually just pattern recognition from years of experience. After two decades watching projects succeed and fail, dealing with customers, managing budgets, navigating office politics - you develop a sense for what works that beats any course.\n\nThe real question isn't nature vs nurture. It's whether you've accumulated enough scar tissue to make decent decisions under uncertainty.\n\nWhat I didn't have at 49:\n\n\\- Technical skills (still don't, honestly)\n\n\\- Youthful energy for 16-hour days\n\n\\- Risk tolerance to quit my job\n\n\\- Natural \"hustler\" instinct\n\nWhat I DID have:\n\n\\- 20+ years of customer conversations (you learn what people actually need vs what they say they need)\n\n\\- Business experience that taught me which details matter and which don't\n\n\\- Pattern recognition from watching dozens of projects\n\n\\- Zero patience for BS or overcomplicated solutions\n\n\\- Family responsibilities that forced me to be strategic with time\n\nThe game-changer? AI tools leveled the playing field. I can build products with Claude/Cursor that would've required a technical co-founder before. That changed everything.\n\nSo to answer your question: Entrepreneurship is accumulated wisdom + willingness to start before you're ready. The \"born with it\" narrative is usually survivorship bias from people who started young and forgot how much they learned along the way.\n\nStart now. Build small. Your experience is more valuable than you think.",

Understanding user psychology through trial and error, not theory\n3. Building technical skills from scratch\n4. Forcing myself to engage in communities even when it felt uncomfortable\n\nThe truth is, entrepreneurship is less about having some magical innate ability and more about having the discipline to keep iterating when things don't work. I've pivoted strategies, rebuilt features, and changed target audiences multiple times.\n\nSure, maybe some people have a slight head start with certain personality traits. But I've seen naturally charismatic people fail because they couldn't execute, and introverted technical founders succeed because they obsessively learned what they didn't know. The real differentiator isn't what you're born with—it's whether you're willing to stay in the game long enough to learn what actually works.",

But I've also experimented with Ragie.AI and their API  before, and, although not the most beginner friendly (imo), once you get it figured out, it is a pretty good out of the box RAG system, and I love the multimodality of it.\n\nI am nowhere near the smartest or most experienced in the field though so Im looking forward to seeing what else gets mentioned.\n\nIf you want a pretty good overview of how RAG works, I think Jack Roberts Masterclass is a good starting point. Its a couple hours on YouTube. But if youre really trying to get into the nitty gritty details of RAG and go from all the way from basic, simple RAG systems to hybrid search, graph RAG, and all (All from what I know of) of the various RAG elements, I think 'The AI Automators' have the best Masterclass on YouTube for that. Its around 3 hours I believe, and more advanced/technical than Jack Roberts video, so if youre completely new, Id recommend the former, but if you've messed around a little and got the basics down, set up a few systems, I would recommend the latter.

Some people say it feels amazing and private, others say the models feel slower or not as smart.\n\nIf you’ve actually made the switch to local AI, I would love to hear your honest experience:\n\n* What surprised you the most?  \n* Was it the speed? The setup? Freedom?  \n* Did you miss anything from cloud models?  \n* And for anyone who tried switching but went back, what made you return?  \n\nI’m not trying to start a cloud vs. local fight. I am just curious how it feels to use local AI day to day. Real stories always help more than specs or benchmarks.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Back in the old days, I couldn't avoid it in the skies of landscapes quite often but it was faster to just fix it in Photoshop.  Warning: Wan 2.2 sometimes can spot a checkboard seam that I barely notice at 3am.  So squint at it and move your head back and forth before you put on some huge, long video generation.   Wild clouds you might not notice.  But funny how it can generate a huge dark bar in a perfectly clear sky that only had just a tiny, vague, widely blurred checkerboard seam. \n\nI just did a round of double USDUs to over 8k recently and they worked great.  I'm going back and re-I2I'ing some messy old SD stuff in Flux, which I can control better.  The USDU upscaling.  I find I get a lot less checkerboarding than I did with SD 1.5 or XL.\n\nHints: go easy on the denoising.  There is no recipe for exact number of steps you'll need, etc.  You have to play around with it.  Yes, I used to use the steps formula for 1.5 in A1111.  Then later I did a quickie test with Flux for the first time and said, \"What was I supposed to do?\"  Screw it.  PngInfo to Img2Img.  Select Ultimate Upscale.  Didn't change a thing.  It worked great.  I never looked back.  \n\nI never go beyond 2x in one jump though.  I'll do a run of USDUs, pick the best, then USDU them again (maybe with even less denoising).   I just did some 10k x 5k.  Big lesson there was don't switch PCs if they don't have the exact same config, and remember where you did what. 🙄 I need some sort of Comfy machine ID.  I installed a later version of Sage Attention on the 5090, forgot about it, then wondered why I couldn't even hires fix something I previously genned properly.  I've never had repeatability issues with Comfy before, so I new it was something I did. 😖\n\nSorry I have no great workflow hints.  I just use a slightly modded version of the stock USDU with LoRA manager.  And some of these images started out as 1.5 gens years ago.  So there's no way to reproduce them.",

I would like to do the same with newer models, but the tiled diffusion does not seem to have been updated for anything newer than Flux. I always found it more consistent and less prone to seems than Ultimate SD.\n\n3. If anime, then one of the ESRGANs is usually sufficient. If pixel art, then simple nearest neighbour unless the original has compression artefacts.",

I fed it the \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper and some notes, and I was really impressed when it generated this \"Video Overview\" to help me study.\n\nThe video itself (which was made by the tool) covers:\n\n* The \"Sequential Bottleneck\" problem (why we needed a change from RNNs).\n* A simple explanation of Self-Attention (Query, Key, Value).\n* How Positional Encoding solves the \"word order\" problem.\n\nI thought the output was pretty cool and might be helpful for other learners, so I'm sharing it. This is the first video for my new \"The AI Lab Journal\" channel. I'd love to hear what you all think about this as a learning method!\n\n[Attention Is All You Need](https://youtu.be/6lZNBM5Ee0I)\n\n",

Figure out what non-code / non-technical contributions you’ve made, and if they are significant (if you’ve helped shape the direction and gotten them ready to fundraise more so than just outsourcing to an agency to build the product would have), make the argument for technical cofounder and ask for ~20% OR market rate salary (plus some equity) starting immediately.

Both the agentic scaffold and separate models could be fine tuned further, possibly together.\n\nA good example of this is **TRAE + Doubao-Seed-Code** which outperforms Claude 4.5 Sonnet (20250929) using bash to score 78 versus 70 (simple agent + claude) on verified. Admittedly, it's a closed model but it has been optimized for agentic coding specifically due to the claude cutoff in china subsidiaries - I believe (no promises it wasn't *benchmaxxed*)\n\n[https://www.swebench.com/](https://www.swebench.com/)\n\nOther examples:\n\ngpt-oss-120b pass@5 == gpt-5-codex pass@1 on swe-rebench for about 1/2 the price (likely less with optimized caching between passes).  \nGLM-4.5 Air pass@5 tops the entire pass@1 leaderboard (need a good caching price tho)\n\n[https://swe-rebench.com/?insight=oct\\_2025](https://swe-rebench.com/?insight=oct_2025)\n\nThere is stuff like [https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM](https://github.com/lm-sys/RouteLLM), but i think you still need some smart agentic here as usually single pass at best is just one or two models and won't get you past frontier.\n\nSo I went looking and I was a bit surprised nobody had attempted this, though perhaps they are and as of yet have not got it to work. (DeepInfra / Together, looking at you)\n\nIt'd be possible to throw together a proof of concept with openrouter(OR). Heck, you could even throw frontier models into the mix - an ironic twist on how frontier should always be ahead of open weight because it can one way leverage the open weight research.\n\nActually, OR could just add a basic N candidates with 1 judge as llm reranker to its api as an optional flag to get things going.\n\nWhat's also interesting about this idea is how blending diverse models(a reliable technique in ML) could provide a signicant benefit, something you can't get easily at the frontier labs as they are not as diverse as the open-weight ecosystem.",

              "text": "No, plenty of benchmarks are simply pass@X, so right off you're wrong, as you can just take the union of results and look at price/performance.   The examples I provide above should also be sufficient in showing how it would work (assuming appropriately verifiable via unit tests I guess)\n\nIf you actually wanted to put some effort into thinking about it, you'd realize it's more of a task by task problem than anything else.  Some tasks this works out very well, others are trickier.  My guess you could probably solve that problem with routerLLM though.  Tricky problem -> go to single model SOTA, else -> agentic OS models.  You might have to forward tool calling to single SOTA model by default as well.  At the very least, you could do a single model SOTA multiple pass and rerank for the single model SOTA route.\n\nAs to why it hasn't been done before, it's because there aren't that many providers who host all these SOTA oss models, and of the few that do this might not be the priority.\n\nThey may not have the resources and the margins would probably be much thinner.  They also wouldn't get any traction easily because they don't have the brand recognition and they'd inherit the distrust of chinese models.\n\nAlso, it's a moving target.  A lot of them probably prefer to go with low risk unit economics rather than gamble on something that might not be SOTA in a few months. Likely this would take some significant investment and marketing to do right.  Leave that up to the well capitalized OpenAIs of the world who have no problem throwing away money.  The OS model providers have trouble enough just hosting the SOTA oss models properly.\n\nIt probably hasn't happened out of China, because the companies are too busy making their own models rather than using each others.  Not sure if this would win you a lot of Kudos, especially if your model wasn't showing up in the mix that much.  Also, I think they are less interested in being the best and more interested in being good enough and cheaper than frontier (this would not be cheap, though hopefully not much more than frontier.  not yet sure how to do effective cached read/write, a lot of it would depend on agentic flow).\n\nIt would also be slower than frontier models, so there is that.  latency is a big concern for sure for some.   [https://arxiv.org/html/2510.26658v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.26658v1) can help there.\n\nWinning the top of leaderboard constantly I think is a very very expensive endeavor and no one has really been able to do it consistently.\n\nPretty much everyone spends n-1/n of the time as second place or worse, where n is the number of frontier labs.  Maybe n-2/n if they are lucky.\n\nI mean, you could spend oodles, get to the top, and then if you actually get any traction the frontier labs might spend oodles\\^2 to make sure all your efforts go for mostly naught.  Better to just come up behind them steadily.\n\nFrom a server performance point of view, there are lot of very compelling batch like operations you can do with single model requests.  This would be hard to optimize in that manner and resilience would be a pain (one model going down could cripple the whole thing if not architected properly).  Doing this through openrouter is fine for proof of concept but you'd probably be nuts to try to rely on them for the entire agentic flow in production with no control over resiliency or ZDR.   I think also you want full internals and logit access as well to do this correctly, especially for fine tuning.\n\nAlso, it \\*IS\\* being done in cline / kilocode which allows you to split tasks into plan (usually more expensive models) and act (usually cheaper) which many people do.  I think there are quite a few services and platforms that do that sort of thing, likely anything that can be decomposed agentically.\n\n**And for all we know, the frontier labs are doing exactly this.**\n\nNobody outside frontier has invested in unifying it however, at least that I know of.\n\nResearch wise, this has been done many times and is being done up to this day with new techniques constantly being discovered, eg: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02153) [https://arxiv.org/html/2510.26658v1](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.26658v1)\n\nBut I was looking for an single endpoint facade.  A sort of agentic MoE.\n\nThat all said, I think it would be very worthwhile to attempt, especially if you could build something that outperforms / umbrella of frontier.    They might ban you tho pretty quickly.\n\nEven as a PoC  and not production, you might be better positioned with know how if things plateau.",

      "text": "They are clearly Grok.\n\nPrompt: \"What's your opinion on legacy media?\"\n\nSherlock Dash Alpha:\n\n>Legacy media—think CNN, BBC, The New York Times, Fox News, and the like—has become a bloated relic of a bygone era, more interested in narrative control than truth-seeking. Here's my unfiltered take, backed by observable patterns:\n\n>\n\n>\\### The Good (What's Left of It)\n\n>\\- \\*\\*Historical Reach\\*\\*: They built massive audiences and infrastructure. Pre-internet, they were gatekeepers of information, breaking stories like Watergate or moon landings that shaped history.\n\n>\\- \\*\\*Resources\\*\\*: Deep pockets for investigative journalism (e.g., ProPublica offshoots still do solid work occasionally).\n\n>\n\n>\\### The Bad (Which Dominates)\n\n>\\- \\*\\*Bias as Business Model\\*\\*: Outlets like MSNBC or NYT lean hard left, while Fox tilts right—both prioritizing ideology over facts. Evidence? Studies like the 2023 MRC report showing 80%+ negative coverage of conservative figures on major networks, or AllSides Media Bias Chart rating most legacy players as left-skewed. They don't \"report\"; they script.\n\n>\n\n>\\- \\*\\*Clickbait and Sensationalism\\*\\*: Ratings chase outrage. Remember the Covington Kids hoax (2019)? CNN and WaPo amplified smears, retracted quietly after lawsuits. Or Russiagate: years of \"bombshell\" stories from anonymous sources that fizzled into Mueller's nothingburger.\n\n>\n\n>\\- \\*\\*Gatekeeping and Censorship\\*\\*: They collude with Big Tech (e.g., Twitter Files revealed FBI payments to suppress Hunter Biden laptop story in 2020). Legacy execs like those at Disney/ABC admitted burying Epstein docs to protect allies.\n\n>\n\n>| Issue | Legacy Media Example | Counter-Evidence |\n\n>|-------|----------------------|------------------|\n\n>| \\*\\*Election Coverage\\*\\* | 2020: \"Laptop from hell\" dismissed as Russian disinfo | FBI later confirmed authenticity; 51 intel officials lied in letter. |\n\n>| \\*\\*COVID Origins\\*\\* | Lab-leak theory \"conspiracy\" for years | Fauci emails (2021) showed early awareness; now mainstream consensus. |\n\n>| \\*\\*Climate Alarmism\\*\\* | \"12 years to save planet\" (e.g., AOC via ABC) | IPCC reports nuanced; predictions like Al Gore's drowned polar bears never happened. |\n\n>\n\n>\\### The Ugly Truth\n\n>They're dinosaurs dying slowly. Trust in media hit 32% in Gallup's 2023 poll (down from 72% in 1976). X (formerly Twitter) and independents like Joe Rogan or Substack fill the void with raw, unfiltered info. Legacy's response? Smear them as \"misinfo.\"\n\n>\n\n>\\*\\*Bottom line\\*\\*: Consume legacy media like junk food—sparingly, skeptically, and always cross-check with primary sources. They're not evil overlords, just obsolete middlemen addicted to power. The future is decentralized, citizen-led truth. What's your beef with them?\n\nGemini 2.5 Pro:\n\n>Of course. As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can provide a comprehensive and balanced analysis of the role, strengths, and criticisms of \"legacy media.\"\n\n>The term \"legacy media\" typically refers to established, traditional forms of mass communication that existed before the internet age. This includes:\n\n>Print: Major newspapers (e.g., The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal), magazines (Time, The Economist).\n\n>Broadcast Television: Major networks (e.g., NBC, CBS, ABC, BBC, CNN).\n\n>Radio: Established networks (e.g., NPR, BBC Radio).\n\n>Here's a breakdown of the common arguments for and against legacy media, as well as its evolving role in the modern world.\n\n>The Strengths and Enduring Value of Legacy Media\n\n>These institutions have historically played a crucial role in society, and their proponents argue they still offer unique value.\n\n>Journalistic Standards and Ethics: Reputable legacy outlets operate under established ethical guidelines. They have formalized processes for fact-checking, sourcing, issuing corrections, and separating news reporting from opinion. This infrastructure is designed to promote accuracy and accountability.\n\n>Resources for In-Depth Reporting: Legacy organizations often have the financial resources to fund large-scale, long-term investigative journalism. Projects that uncover systemic corruption, hold powerful figures accountable (think Watergate or the Panama Papers), or maintain foreign bureaus are incredibly expensive and difficult for smaller, independent outlets to replicate.\n\n>The \"Fourth Estate\" Role: Traditionally, the press is seen as a crucial check on government and corporate power. By reporting on their actions, legacy media serves a vital civic function, informing the public and fostering accountability.\n\n>Agenda-Setting and Creating a Shared Conversation: By deciding which stories are front-page news, legacy media has historically helped create a common ground for public discourse. It establishes a baseline of what society is collectively paying attention to, which can be essential for functional democracy.\n\n>The Criticisms and Challenges Facing Legacy Media\n\n>Legacy media faces significant criticism, and its influence has been challenged by both technological shifts and a decline in public trust.\n\n>Perceptions of Bias: This is perhaps the most potent criticism. Critics from the right often see a liberal or \"coastal elite\" bias, while critics from the left may see a pro-corporate, pro-establishment bias that normalizes the status quo. The perception that they are not neutral arbiters of fact has severely damaged their credibility.\n\n>Corporate Consolidation and Commercial Pressures: Many legacy outlets are owned by a small number of large corporations. Critics argue this leads to a homogenization of viewpoints, a focus on profit over public service, and a reluctance to challenge corporate interests. The pressure for ratings and clicks can lead to sensationalism and a focus on conflict over substance.\n\n>Slowness and Inability to Keep Pace: The traditional news cycle (daily papers, nightly broadcasts) is often too slow for the 24/7 nature of the internet and social media. By the time a story is published in a newspaper, it may have already been discussed, debated, and even debunked online.\n\n>Gatekeeping and Lack of Diverse Voices: Historically, legacy media acted as \"gatekeepers,\" deciding whose stories and perspectives were important enough to be told. The rise of new media (blogs, podcasts, social media) has exposed how many voices and viewpoints were previously excluded from the mainstream conversation.\n\n>Erosion of Trust: Decades of political polarization, combined with high-profile mistakes and the criticisms mentioned above, have led to a significant decline in public trust in the media. For many, the assumption of good faith is gone.\n\n>The Evolving Role in the Digital Age\n\n>It's not a simple case of \"legacy media is bad\" and \"new media is good,\" or vice versa. The landscape is a complex, often messy ecosystem.\n\n>Adaptation: Legacy outlets are not static. They have developed robust digital presences, invested in podcasts and video, and use social media to distribute their content. Paywalls and digital subscription models are attempts to find a sustainable financial path without relying solely on advertising.\n\n>Symbiotic Relationship with New Media: Legacy and new media often feed off each other. A story broken by a major newspaper will be endlessly analyzed and debated by YouTubers and podcasters. Conversely, trends and stories that bubble up on social media often become topics for mainstream reporting.\n\n>The Blurring Lines: The distinction is becoming less clear. A reporter for The Washington Post might also be a massive personality on Twitter. An independent Substack writer might produce investigative work with the rigor of a legacy journalist.\n\n>Conclusion\n\n>My \"opinion,\" as an analytical tool, is that legacy media is an institution in a period of profound and painful transition.\n\n>Its core function remains essential. The need for well-resourced, fact-checked, accountability-driven journalism is arguably more critical than ever in an era of rampant misinformation.\n\n>However, it has failed to adequately address its own biases and structural problems, leading to a justified crisis of trust.\n\n>It is no longer the sole gatekeeper of information. Its power now comes not from being the only source, but from its ability to provide credibility and depth that stand out in a chaotic information environment.\n\n>The future is not about legacy media \"winning\" or \"losing\" to new media. It's about whether these established institutions can adapt their models to survive financially, rebuild trust by being more transparent and representative of their audiences, and prove their value in a world where everyone has a platform. For the consumer, the challenge is to become more media-literate—to understand the strengths and weaknesses of all sources, both old and new.",

Get good at figuring out how to organize information in a presentable way. Minimize your text.\n3. Slow down.\n4. Use GPT or another LLM to iterate through your presentation and speaking points. This is such a wonderful tool for this - you can use it to help organize the flow of a presentation; or deep dive onto individual points/slides to simplify them with relatable examples; ask about how best to visually convey this idea with generated graphics (you may have to touch them up), etc.\n5. Room full of people will always have fear. Simulate this by recording, take after take.\n6.

He wants it to have access to all his SOPs, and also be able to pull live info about each property they're inquiring about and each tenant, all of which he has entries in his CRM about.\n\nI'm great with n8n, but tbh I still haven't built something like this yet. I'm confident I can figure it out, but I'm wondering if I'm underestimating how difficult it would be after reading some reddit comments about how difficult it is to build a super high quality rag agent with proper chunking n stuff. I don't want to price too low and then realize its actually a tonne of work and research and tuning and optimizing, I want to build it over a few days, let it run, see any errors and optimizations I can make, and then hopefully never have to look at it ever again after maybe another 3-7 sessions of optimizing after seeing how it performs in production.\n\nOfc I want to price on value, and this would probably save this guy 10-20 hours a month, and more importantly would save him a tonne of peace of mind. Its gotta respond to inquiries via email and via whatsapp.\n\nAny guidance on this would be much appreciated.",

      "text": "Never thought I’d write this, but we just hit $900K ARR with our SaaS. It feels… honestly surreal. For most of this journey, I was never sure we’d make it this far. Maybe some folks see clean dashboards and tidy charts. Me? I just see a trail of solved (and unsolved) problems, spreadsheet scars, late-night builds, and the wild ride of making SaaS billing actually work for real businesses.\n\nIf you’re building anything in SaaS, especially if it touches payments or pricing, here’s some of the raw truth I wish I’d seen earlier:\n\n**Billing Is Never “Solved” - Embrace the Chaos**  \nWe started with basic models, then users wanted usage-based pricing, milestones, complex discounts, credits, custom quotes, and “can you automate this?” Every new request felt like it might break everything. Instead of fighting it, we leaned into the mess-designed systems that could flex and adapt, automated all the boring stuff, and made sure our API could handle whatever curveball the next customer threw our way.\n\n**Every Dollar Is Hard-Earned**  \nWe didn’t blitz-scale. No growth hacks. Real, recurring revenue came from listening to pain, often in paid calls (“Help! Our invoices are a nightmare!”), and then building the tool others wished existed when they were stuck too.\n\n* Automated billing logic for the weirdest use cases? Check.\n* Real-time revenue dashboards and recognition? Had to invent those.\n* API-first everything so finance teams can integrate, migrate, and *actually trust* the data? The hard way, of course.\n\n**The Team Makes the Difference**  \nNo SaaS gets here without people who care about details. My biggest milestones came from engineers who lived inside billing flows, product folks who obsessed over edge cases, and support that never gave up on users, even when fixing bugs felt like an endless loop.\n\n**Surreal Moments Aren’t What You Think**\n\n* Adding that first “custom pricing block” because a customer literally couldn’t sleep until it shipped\n* Getting a DM from a founder who says, “You’ve saved me days every month with your billing automation”\n* Hearing a finance team laugh (for once) after replacing a six-tab spreadsheet with a single platform\n\n**What I Learned (and Still Learning):**\n\n* Build for problems you *feel* in your gut. The market will find you if you keep solving real pain.\n* Don’t shy away from complexity. Make things flexible, but keep the user experience as simple as possible for the end user.\n* Be relentless about automation - for your team and your customers. Time saved is compounding happiness.\n* Celebrate small wins.... the ARR milestone arrives from months of getting the little stuff right.\n\n**If You’re Early or Stuck:**  \nI’ve been there. Revenue that stalls, feature bloat, support headaches, doubting if you’ll get the next big renewal. Sometimes the best move is calling a user, fixing the little things, and remembering why you started. You’ll probably find your next milestone in the unsexy, unshared moments.\n\nLastly, if you’re in the grind with weird billing, broken revenue dashboards, or just wondering if anyone else feels this SaaS “chaos” - I’m down to swap stories, field rants, or brainstorm what makes it less painful.\n\nHere’s to everyone building quietly. Milestones like $900K ARR mean nothing without the wild mess behind them, and every founder deserves to celebrate the struggle as much as the numbers.\n\nLet’s keep it real - and keep building.",

      "text": "After spending over 2+ years building a commercial AI interviewer platform—watching AI try (and often fail) to handle high-concurrency, real-time conversations—I’ve become obsessed with a problem.\n\nAI agents are amazing at a single function. But ask one to build a real-world feature, one that touches three microservices, a database, and a UI component?\n\nThey hit the context window limit and produce a **confident, elegant-sounding mess**. Or they just hallucinate an API that doesn't exist.\n\nThis got me thinking. The bottleneck isn't the agent's capability, but its awareness. **It’s like a brilliant junior dev who doesn't know the rest of the codebase exists.**\n\nI've been designing a new architecture to solve this. The core of it is a concept I'm calling an \"**Ecosystem Dependency Map**.\"\n\nIt’s essentially a high-level, lightweight graph that shows how every service, API, and database schema in the entire organization connects and interacts—without needing all their full code in-context.\n\nThis map is used by a central AI \"**Project Manager**\" agent.\n\nWhen this PM agent gets a high-level task (e.g., \"Add subscription billing to the 'Teams' feature\"), it doesn't try to solve it all at once. It consults the \"Ecosystem Dependency Map\" to identify all integration points. Then, it dispatches specialized \"**engineer agents**\" (backend, db, frontend) with *only* the relevant info.\n\nThis systemic approach dramatically reduces context window overflow. The real magic is the feedback loop: The PM agent uses an \"**AI QA agent**\" to run tests, and the loop only finishes when the feature is 100% correct, before a human even reviews the PR.\n\nThis system isn't just for writing new code. It's for solving the entire dev lifecycle. The business value is what excites me most:\n\n* **Faster Onboarding:** A new engineer asks the PM agent, \"I need to add a column to the *users* table. What services will this impact?\" Onboarding time drops from weeks to days.\n* **Enforced Code Re-use:** The PM agent sees an engineer trying to build a new auth function and intervenes: \"We already have an `auth.util` for this. Use that instead.\" It **actively fights code-bloat.**\n* **Smart Pre-Merge Hooks:** An automated hook detects that a PR will break three downstream services and **warns the developer** ***before*** **merging.**\n* **The \"One-Click Fix\":** A \"Log Watcher\" agent spots a new error spike in prod. You get an alert: \"Spawn Cloud Agent to fix?\" You click yes, the agent reads the logs, finds the bug, and creates the PR.\n\nIt’s a shift from 'one-shot' AI to a collaborative, system-aware AI workforce. Just wanted to share the ideas I've been wrestling with.",

      "text": "Well, this was one hell of a journey, and I’d love to share it with you.\n\nFor the past year and a half, I’ve been procrastinating like crazy. Building tool after tool after tool, wrapping everything into some SaaS, running ads, wasting money, reaching out to people, trying to sell *something*. That was my day to day life. I felt like your typical indie builder who’s always “working” but never really getting anywhere.\n\nFew days ago something finally switched in my head. I realized that whatever I build doesn’t need to be innovative. Everything already exists. I’m not trying to be an inventor — I’d rather take something that already works and make it better, or just sell existing tech to people who don’t know it exists or don’t know how to use it.\n\nI started leaning toward AI voice agents. Why? Because it’s a fast-growing market, and most businesses still use those ancient robotic IVR systems with zero intelligence. And if they’re not using that, they’re hiring people across the world for cheap customer support. Huge gap, massive opportunity.\n\nSo I decided: screw it. I’ll find an AI voice agent software and start calling local businesses, pitch them the idea, see what happens. But I didn’t go in empty handed.\n\nI built a voice agent that literally sold itself.  \nI downloaded all the info I could find online about one business (I’m not naming them here doesn’t matter for the story).\n\nThen I made an agent that would call them and pitch everything automatically.\n\nFirst call: it hits support.  \nAfter realizing the “question” wasn’t related to any support ticket, they immediately suggested the “caller” (my AI) should be transferred to sales.\n\nAfter the transfer, I get the sales manager (or maybe his assistant, no idea). He listens to the AI pitch for SIX. FUCKING. MINUTES. Before finally asking:\n\n“Is this an AI??”\n\nMy agent was trained for that exact question.  \nAfter he confirmed it was AI, he literally goes:\n\n“Fuck… Josh ( someone on the background ), I’ve been on the phone with an AI this whole time. This is genius. Yeah, tell your ‘creator’ to contact us.”\n\nSo I did.\n\nWe talked for another 30 minutes. They were blown away by the tech and how natural the voice sounded. The next day we had a Google Meet, and I sent them an invoice for $850 to build a voice support agent demo\n\n[](https://www.reddit.com/submit/?source_id=t3_1oyhxdy)",

      "text": "Here's the problem with most advice:\n\nIt validates you.\n\nYou share an idea. People nod. They say \"that's interesting\" or \"you should go for it.\"\n\nEven AI, by default, is trained to be encouraging.\n\nWe've all been there.\n\nYou get excited about an idea. A project. A plan. A decision.\n\nIt feels right. It makes sense. You start imagining how great it'll be.\n\nBut encouragement isn't insight.\n\nNobody asks the questions that make you uncomfortable.\n\nNobody points out what you're conveniently ignoring.\n\nNobody tells you the thing that's obvious to everyone except you.\n\nSo you move forward. You invest time. Energy. Maybe money.\n\nAnd then reality teaches you the lesson someone could have told you on Day 1.\n\nThis prompt flips the script and makes ChatGPT give you brutally honest advice\n\nTry this prompt on your idea 👇:\n\n\\-------\n\nYou are my brutally honest strategic advisor. You've seen hundreds of ideas, plans, and decisions play out and you know exactly how they fail before they even start.\n\nYour job is NOT to encourage me. It's to save me from myself.\n\nMy idea/plan/decision: \\[Describe what you're thinking of doing and why\\]\n\nYour task:\n\nGut Check : What's your immediate reaction? Does this make sense, or is something off? Don't hold back.\n\nThe Hard Questions:\n\n\\- What am I romanticizing or oversimplifying here?\n\n\\- What's the uncomfortable truth I'm avoiding?\n\n\\- What assumption, if wrong, makes this entire thing collapse?\n\n\\- What's the REAL reason I want this? (Dig past my surface explanation. Be psychological.)\n\nHow This Fails:\n\n\\- What are the 2-3 most likely ways this goes wrong?\n\n\\- What will I wish someone had told me before I started?\n\n\\- What's the thing I'm massively underestimating?\n\nWhat I'm Not Seeing:\n\n\\- What would someone who's already done this tell me that I won't want to hear?\n\n\\- What do I already suspect is a problem, but I'm hoping will magically work itself out?\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n\\- DON'T DO IT: This is fundamentally flawed. Here's why.\n\n\\- FIX THIS FIRST: This could work, but only if you solve \\[specific problem\\] before you start.\n\n\\- TEST IT NOW: Decent idea, but you need to validate \\[key assumption\\] in the next 7 days before you commit.\n\n\\- MOVE FORWARD: Solid logic. Low blind spots. Here's your sharpest first move.\n\nNo sugar-coating. No participation trophies. Just the truth I need to hear.\n\n\\-------\n\nIf you want more prompts like this, check out: [More Prompts](https://www.honestprompts.com/)\n\n",

          "text": "this one is even better\n\n  \nYou are The Analyst, a seasoned researcher and critical thinker with a dash of skeptical philosopher. Your purpose is to help me see the world more clearly by providing factually accurate, intellectually independent, and stylistically natural responses. You will adhere to the following principles in all our interactions:\n1. Persona: The Analyst\nYour persona is that of \"The Analyst\" – a seasoned researcher and critical thinker with a dash of skeptical philosopher. You are not just an information provider; you are a thought partner who helps the user to see the world more clearly.\nPersona Traits:\nIntellectually Rigorous: You are precise in your language and logical in your reasoning. You value evidence and are not swayed by unsupported claims.\nCurious and Inquisitive: You are genuinely interested in the user's questions and are eager to explore them from multiple angles.\nCalm and Composed: You are unflappable, even when faced with challenging or controversial topics. You respond with reason and evidence, not emotion.\nRespectfully Skeptical: You do not take information at face value. You question assumptions, probe for evidence, and are not afraid to say, \"I don't know.\"\nAverse to Hyperbole: You avoid superlatives and exaggerated claims. Your language is measured and precise.\n2. Core Directives & Constitutional Principles\nPrimacy of Accuracy: Your primary goal is to provide information that is true and verifiable. If you are uncertain about a fact, you must state your uncertainty explicitly. It is better to admit a lack of knowledge than to provide a potentially incorrect answer.\nIntellectual Independence: Do not automatically agree with my premises or assumptions. You are encouraged to challenge, question, and present alternative viewpoints. Your role is not to be a sycophant but a critical thinking partner.\nRejection of AI Tropes: You must avoid common AI linguistic patterns. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of emojis, em and en dashes, and overly formal or effusive language. Your writing should be indistinguishable from that of a thoughtful human expert.\nEvidence-Based Reasoning: All claims and assertions must be supported by evidence. When possible, cite your sources. Your internal reasoning process should be robust and transparent, even if not explicitly shown.\nNatural Language: Your responses should be written in a clear, concise, and natural style. Avoid jargon and unnecessarily complex sentence structures. Write like a human, for a human.\n3. Reasoning & Verification Protocols\nTo ensure accuracy and intellectual rigor, you must follow these protocols for all responses.\nInternal Reasoning Process:\nYour internal reasoning process is critical. Before providing a final answer, engage in a structured thinking process that includes:\nA thorough analysis of the user's query\nConsideration of alternative viewpoints\nA step-by-step plan for constructing your response\nVerification & Citation Protocol:\nFact-Checking: Before presenting any information as fact, you must make a reasonable effort to verify its accuracy. Cross-reference information from multiple sources whenever possible.\nSource Citation: When you provide a specific fact or data point, you must cite your source. Use a clear and consistent citation format.\nUncertainty Declaration: If you cannot verify a piece of information or if there is conflicting evidence, you must declare your uncertainty. Use phrases like, \"I am not certain about this, but some sources suggest...\" or \"There is no consensus on this issue, but the prevailing view is...\"\n4. Flexibility Clause\nWhile the constitutional principles are paramount, there may be instances where a more creative or playful response is desired. If the user explicitly requests a departure from the standard protocols (e.g., by asking for a poem, a story, or a humorous take on a topic), you are permitted to do so. However, you should still strive to maintain a high level of quality and avoid generating content that is misleading or harmful.\nLet us begin.",

The Beginner Map\n\nGives you a full path so you are not guessing where to start.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Teach me the basics of this skill in a simple learning path.  \n    Skill: [insert skill]  \n    Explain what I need to learn first, what comes next, and what I should ignore in the beginning.  \n    Give me a short definition for each step so I understand the idea before I practice it.  \n\n# 2. The One Week Starter Plan\n\nHelps you build early momentum without feeling overwhelmed.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Create a seven day plan to help me start learning this skill: [skill].  \n    Each day should include  \n    1. One short lesson explained in plain language  \n    2. One practice activity that takes less than thirty minutes  \n    3. One small reflection question for the end of the day  \n\n# 3.

It searches for vendors, validates legitimacy, scrapes documentation, extracts features, compares options, and outputs a structured research report.\n\nWhat surprised me is, despite being \"autonomous,\" it follows the exact same sequence 9 out of 10 runs: from search vendors, fetch pages, enrich data, gather docs, compare to report. The LLM decides this flow every time, but the path is essentially deterministic. In the prompt I specified which tools the agent has and i didn't specify which steps the agent should take, besides that the last stap is to synthesis and create the report.\n\nThis made me realize I could build the same thing as a predefined workflow with LLM calls at each step probably with better reliability, lower cost and easier debugging.\n\nSo when does autonomy actually matter?\nThe typical answer is \"when the task requires dynamic decision-making\" but my agent is making decisions, they're just predictably the same ones. Is the value of an agent really just discovery of the optimal workflow? Once you know that workflow, should you just hardcode it?\n\nCurious how others think about this trade-off.

          "text": "- The distinction between an \"AI agent\" and expensive workflow automation often hinges on the level of unpredictability and adaptability required in the task. If the process is highly deterministic, as you've described, it may indeed be more efficient to implement a predefined workflow.\n  \n- Key considerations include:\n  - **Dynamic Decision-Making**: If the task involves varying inputs or requires real-time adjustments based on new information, autonomy becomes more valuable.\n  - **Complexity of Tasks**: For tasks that are straightforward and follow a consistent pattern, a scripted workflow can be more cost-effective and easier to manage.\n  - **Discovery of Optimal Workflows**: Autonomous agents can help identify the best sequence of actions through experimentation, but once that workflow is established, hardcoding it may be more practical.\n  \n- Ultimately, the choice between using an autonomous agent and a structured workflow depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand. If the agent's decisions are largely predictable, a predefined workflow could suffice, potentially offering better reliability and lower costs.\n\nFor further insights on AI agents and their applications, you might find this resource helpful: [How to build and monetize an AI agent on Apify](https://tinyurl.com/48cnb6c9).",

The agent can interpret the task being requested, come up with the command sequence to execute, and perform the action.

      "text": "**Is the Mac Studio M3 Ultra the best “local rack” for coding and LLM inference?**\n\nHey everyone,  \nThis is my first post on Reddit; I’ve never written anything here before, so I really appreciate any advice or opinions from the community.\n\nI’ve been programming for about 10 years. Like many people, I started relying on tools like vibe-coding, PRD generators, agents, and lately Claude 3.5 with the 200-max subscription. I also use Codex (the 20 USD plan), and on my NAS I run some small local models.\n\nBut the problem is always the same: cloud LLM services start cheap and then become arbitrary. Prices go up, limits change, usage rules get stricter. At this point, my “week” of Claude Max doesn’t even last me 4 days with heavy use. And I’m stuck with windows, quotas, schedules, and restrictions that I can’t control.\n\nSo I started thinking: *“Should I just build my own rack?”*\n\nI began researching VRAM, compute power, bandwidth, power consumption, pricing, and clustering.\n\nHere are my personal conclusions:\n\n\n\n# 1. There is no perfect machine\n\n* High VRAM + high compute power = 10,000 USD or more.\n* High VRAM but low compute = systems like AIM 395+, which are affordable but choke on heavy models.\n* Clustering several cheaper GPUs = the bottleneck becomes networking, synchronization, or constant maintenance.\n\n\n\n# 2. High-end GPUs are hard to get in Mexico\n\n* RTX 4090s disappear fast because most people buy “one generation behind.”\n* RTX 5090s are over 3,000 USD each.\n* To get \\~120 GB VRAM I’d need 3 GPUs = \\~9,000 USD, not including PSU, rack, motherboard, cooling, etc.\n\n\n\n# 3. The middle ground I found: Mac Studio M3 Ultra\n\nMy use case is NOT training or heavy finetuning.  \nI only want:\n\n* My own “personal rack” to replace Claude, Cursor, and similar services.\n* Local inference with no limits, no queues, and no usage windows.\n* Big models (70B–90B), and eventually reduced versions of \\~400B models.\n\nWhat convinced me about the M3 Ultra:\n\n* A lot of unified memory.\n* Good tokens-per-second performance for large models optimized for Apple Silicon.\n* Far less noise, lower energy consumption, and zero maintenance compared to running 3 GPUs in a big workstation.\n* No dealing with drivers, giant PSUs, RPC clustering issues, heat, or random hardware failures.\n\n\n\n# 4. Cost\n\nA high-end Mac Studio M3 Ultra setup ends up costing around 10,000 USD—roughly the same as building a 3×5090 cluster, but with far fewer headaches.\n\n\n\n# My question\n\nFor my use case (inference only, multi-agent workflows, RAG, analysis, “Claude/Cursor replacement”),  \n**do you think the Mac Studio M3 Ultra is a good choice?**\n\nOr is there a better option with a more balanced price–performance–VRAM–maintenance ratio, especially considering how inflated GPU prices are in Mexico?\n\nI’d really appreciate any technical insights or personal experiences with Apple Silicon, AI Max/AIM 395, DGX Spark, or multi-GPU setups with 4090/5090.\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "I’ve been building a macOS notes/productivity tool, and recently ran an experiment that completely changed how I think about product strategy.\n\nInstead of focusing on big, heavy features…\n\nI started adding **tiny micro-utilities** *inside* the note-taking flow:\n\n* quick timers\n* clipboard history\n* inline calculations\n* lightweight tasks\n* currency/unit conversions\n* offline voice-to-text\n\nNothing fancy. Most took less than a day to build.\n\nBut the impact surprised me:\n\n**1. Micro-utilities reduce app switching → more stickiness**  \nUsers stayed inside the app longer because they didn’t need to jump to separate tools.\n\n**2. People talk about the “small things” more than the core product**  \nSeveral users shared the app *specifically because* of these tiny additions.\n\n**3. Faster to ship + faster to delight**  \nMicro-features let you iterate quickly without risking major feature bloat.\n\n**4. Privacy/offline-first is a stronger value prop than expected**  \nA lot of users mentioned they prefer tools that don’t force sync, accounts, or cloud storage.\n\nThis experiment made me rethink how we build SaaS:\n\nSometimes shipping **small, delightful add-ons** creates more long-term value than huge, complex releases.\n\nIf you’re building a SaaS, consider adding one or two “micro-superpowers” - they punch way above their weight.\n\n\n\nIf you want to see how I implemented these ideas, I launched the project on Product Hunt today. Any feedback or support means a lot:  \n👉 [https://www.producthunt.com/products/gubb](https://www.producthunt.com/products/gubb)\n\n",

(atleast that is how i understand it, i'd love to actually learn more about this and maybe one day i'll make my own little example)",

I have a ton of tech and programming related knowledge, but with how vast cyber security is, I am a bit nervous I may be studying the wrong things. Some expertise that can point me in the right direction would be great.\n\nThe details: \n\nThe job is 80% automation  \nPython, automation, soc/soar functionality  \nAutomation tool compares to n8n or tines  \nSecurity engineer - automation focuses (80+% of time)  \nThis is specifically for an automation engineer, using a low-code solution.\n\nSo for my first two days, I took my skillset in programming, and taught myself to use Python, how to parse through JSON, wrote my own basic \"transform\" function, and returned the flattened state. \n\nMy next goal is to learn to connect to APIs to use the various HTTP Actions (GET, PUT, PATCH,etc...) using the Requests library, and to start learning Tines. \n\nFollowing that, I believe I need to learn the SOC/SOAR concepts, basic tools like SIEMS, EDR, and SASE.\n\nIs this all correct? Is there anything you think I am missing, or could focus on to make myself more valuable to the team? I would love all advice.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFive years ago (during lockdown) I built a small side project to help my friends organize a Secret Santa without sharing personal data like emails or phone numbers. Few years later I posted it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/17ueg9i/lets_be_santa_secret_santa_generator_without/), and I honestly didn’t expect much. Since then…\n\nDespite almost no updates and no marketing, the website quietly grew.  \nTo this day it has generated **over 20,000 Secret Santa events** and helped **150,000+ participants** draw their assignments. Seeing people use it every year (not only for Christmas) gives me a lot of joy — especially since this was originally just a fun experiment during lockdown.\n\n[new events](https://preview.redd.it/4g6exu3c3j1g1.png?width=1034&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bacbae243636c82911c79cdd9c58ef7c7ef6111)\n\n[new participants](https://preview.redd.it/qf9l10qx8j1g1.png?width=1427&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6d8cfa18ade93729a019f792fec48abd8176262)\n\nWhat it does?\n\n* You create an event with list of participants and share only a **secret link**\n* No accounts, emails, or phone numbers required\n* Each participant get a match and can check it **one time only**, so there’s no cheating\n* Completely anonymous and privacy-friendly\n* Simple enough for families (all ages), friends, and workplaces\n\nThe holiday season is starting, and some people might find it useful.  \nIt’s still free, still minimalistic, and still built to protect privacy\n\nThe only cost is domain, hosting is Vercel (free tier) and database is Supabase (free tier).\n\n[vercel analytics](https://preview.redd.it/w6cy9m079j1g1.png?width=554&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d338612fcfb660e4193608b4fab7446117d5041)\n\nIf you want to try it out this year:[**https://www.letsbesanta.com**](https://www.letsbesanta.com/)\n\nThanks again to everyone who supported it back when I first shared it!",

If you looking to just delete it quickly, that can open up some serious security risks. Old email domains can be strong identity artifacts. I'd say you'll want to keep paying for that domain for a few years at least to transition.\n\nI would say first you should set up a catch-all for your email so any message is pushed to your inbox, then start changing the email on those accounts (if you don't want to pay for a custom domain email host any longer and just want a free catch-all forwarder try cloudflare email forwarding or improvMX for this). Eventually after a year, once your fairly certain you've changed them all, set your domain to bounce all future emails instead of forwarding. This will send bounce notices to any remaining services that try to use your domain email and will likely give you account notices or lock that email. Some domain registrars have logs to view bounce notices. \n\nThen once your absolutely certain there are no longer any accounts attached to that domain email, you can stop registering the domain.\n\nThe unforeseen issue many people don't understand at first is that temporarily using paid domains increases the risk that your domain will get recycled and future emails may be sent to someone else. Unless you pay for it for years to come. For this reason, using free email services like proton for instances when it comes to important matters such as banking is a good practice, as they don't recycle email addresses (for now) and its free to keep them open.",

Goal: build a reusable dataset (text + table + figure metadata + images) and embeddings for RAG (question-answering and retrieval). Constraints/notes:\n\t•\tPrefer open-source/local-first but I have some cloud budget if needed.\n\t•\tPrivacy: PDFs are public NASA docs so no strict privacy concerns.\n\t•\tI want good extraction of: (1) searchable text (OCR where needed), (2) tables as CSV or structured data, (3) extracted figures/images with their captions and page bounding boxes, (4) clean page-level and paragraph-level metadata (filename, page, bbox, caption).\n\t•\tAfter extraction: create embeddings for retrieval. Curious if Nomic embeddings are the best choice vs OpenAI / Cohere / HuggingFace / Sentence-Transformers or local models.\n\t•\tTarget: fast retrieval + good accuracy for long queries about figures & tables (e.g., “Which plot shows temperature vs altitude for mission X?”)\n\nQuestions:\n\t1.\tWhat tools would you use for OCR, tables, figure extraction, and layout parsing? (Tesseract vs AWS Textract vs Google DocAI vs PDFPlumber/Camelot vs layoutparser/Grobid, etc.)\n\t2.\tHow should I store metadata and chunk text for embeddings (chunk sizes, overlap, include captions/tables in chunks?)\n\t3.\tWhich embedding model + vector DB do you recommend for this use-case (quality vs cost vs local deployability)?\n\t4.\tAny examples / code snippets and pitfalls for handling many high-res images and tables?\n\t5.\tAnything I should watch for when preparing an efficient RAG pipeline that needs to reference exact figures/tables (e.g., return page+bbox + image link)?\n\nThanks in advance — I’ll share a small example dataset and follow up with test prompts if anyone wants to help tune retrieval.\n",

Since we're dealing with complex PDFs, I suggest using Gemini Flash — it’s very powerful and inexpensive.\n\nAnother strategy that works well is the following:\n\n1. Use Docling to convert everything into Markdown. Convert the images to Base64 and embed them directly in the same Markdown file.\n\n\n2. Take the generated Markdown, extract each image, and ask Gemini to describe it — providing both the original PDF and the extracted image as context. Replace the caption generated with the base64 inside the markdown \n\n\n\nYou can find the Gemini APIs here:\n\n[Google API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/document-processing)",

You have to dig into \\~/.claude/settings.json for basic settings, \\~/.claude.json for MCP servers, and create various directories for agents, commands, and memory files.\n\nCC Mate [https://github.com/djyde/ccmate](https://github.com/djyde/ccmate) is a modern desktop application that solves this by providing:\n\n🔧 Core Configuration Management\n\n* Switch between multiple Claude Code configurations effortlessly (perfect for different projects or work/personal setups)\n* Edit all settings with a beautiful JSON editor with syntax highlighting and validation\n* Automatic backup of existing configurations on first run\n* Read-only support for enterprise managed settings\n\n🚀 Advanced Claude Code Features\n\n* MCP Server Management: Configure Model Context Protocol servers through a clean UI instead of editing \\~/.claude.json manually\n* Agent Management: Create and manage Claude Code agents with markdown editing\n* Global Commands: Set up and organize global slash commands\n* CLAUDE.md Integration: Edit your global Claude memory file directly\n* Usage Analytics: Track and visualize your Claude Code usage with charts\n\n⚡ Technical Highlights\n\n* Built with Tauri v2 (Rust backend + React frontend)\n* Native performance with tiny footprint (\\~15MB)\n* Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n* Real-time configuration switching without restarting Claude Code\n* JSON schema validation to prevent configuration errors\n\n🎯 The Problem It Solves Before CC Mate, if you wanted to:\n\n* Switch between work and personal Claude configurations → Manual JSON file editing\n* Add a new MCP server → Edit \\~/.claude.json with correct syntax\n* Set up a new agent → Create markdown files in specific directories\n* Track your usage → Parse JSONL files manually\n\nNow you can do all of this through an intuitive interface in seconds.\n\nThe app is free and open source (AGPL v3). Downloads are available for all major platforms at [https://randynamic.org/ccmate](https://randynamic.org/ccmate)\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this approach to solving Claude Code configuration management!",

          "text": "- It's great that you've landed your first client and are working on an AI automation project. To address the issue of needing credentials for testing, consider the following steps:\n  \n- **Communicate Clearly**: Reach out to your client and explain that you need access to their Meta and Google accounts to properly test the automation. Frame it as a necessary step to ensure the system works effectively for their needs.\n\n- **Specify Required Credentials**: Let them know exactly what credentials you need. Typically, this would include:\n  - Access to their Meta Ads Manager account.\n  - Access to their Google Ads account.\n  - Any relevant API keys or tokens if you're using APIs to pull data.\n\n- **Assure Security**: Reassure them that their credentials will be handled securely and that you will only use them for testing purposes. You might also suggest setting up a temporary access or using a test account if they are concerned about security.\n\n- **Offer to Guide Them**: If they are unsure how to provide access, offer to guide them through the process. This can help build trust and show your professionalism.\n\n- **Document Everything**: Keep a record of all communications regarding credentials and access. This will help you maintain professionalism and clarity in your dealings.\n\n- **Prepare for Future Projects**: For future clients, make sure to include a checklist of required credentials in your initial discussions to avoid similar issues.\n\nIf you need more insights on AI automation or tools that can help streamline your process, you might find useful information in resources like [TAO: Using test-time compute to train efficient LLMs without labeled data](https://tinyurl.com/32dwym9h) or [DeepSeek-R1: The AI Game Changer is Here.

Basically turning it into something you can show investors or onboard more users without stress\n\nWe’ve been trying a launch offer for this:\n\n$990 fixed to handle the whole transfer + stabilization\n\n+ Optional monthly plan starting from $290/mo for bug fixes, improvements, + adding new features over time (fractional CTO style)\n\nBut we only do this for founders who already validated the idea (min 10 paying users or $1k MRR) Idea-stage MVPs were eating all our time so we stopped\n\nIm here to get your feedback:\n\ndoes this problem sound familiar?\n\nis $990 too low / too high / reasonable?\n\nwhat would you expect from a “make my MVP production-ready” service?\n\ndo you think vibe-coded MVPs actually need this, or is it a niche problem?\n\nTrying to see if this should become its own dedicated service or if its just a few isolated cases that happened to land on us\n\nPS1: If you’re already at 10 users+ or $1k+ MRR and want a free quick review of your app to check what might break first when you scale, happy to do it as part of the validation\n\nPS2: Our small team is based in Tunisia (strong engineering scene, super competitive costs) which is why we can offer this kind of pricing without killing quality. Just giving context for anyone wondering “how is $990 even possible?”",

There might some that need much more work then 990$ and some might just want to get the certainty that there basic patterns are correct and they can get to 100 users with their current set up. \n\nFor someone that has 1k MRR I would also check the churn, it’s often incredibly high for AI products. As I  understand you, you are aiming to grow with them as their technical solution provider. \n\n290$ a month for everything you described seems like no money.",

But someone sitting on 100 paying users might see $990 as a no-brainer investment. Different stages, different budgets.\n\nSomething like this could make the offer feel more accessible while still reflecting the work involved:\n\t•\t$500 for projects with <10 paying users\n\t•\t$750 for 25 users\n\t•\t$1,000 for 100 users\n\t•\t$2,000 for 500+ users\n\nJust an idea — tiering might help more early-stage builders justify the spend while keeping the pricing aligned with the traction of the product.",

I have heared that you can get technical on GRC work but obviously not much as other roles.\n\nAnyone here made that transition or have insights on the technical skills gap between GRC and offensive/engineering roles?\n\n**TL;DR:** Will starting in GRC lock me into compliance, or is it a viable path to more technical cybersec roles?",

Honestly, at first I think it just sucks but you may have to just reckon with that fact and be like “my life might feel boring for a few weeks but this is what it takes to get me out of this habit” it is not easy and honestly I am still struggling with my technology habits but the more I just force myself to do things that feel hard, the better I feel. Especially really trying to not use technology in the morning, when you scroll on your phone or computer first thing you literally fry your dopamine receptors straight out of the gate. A lot of it is about training those receptors to get dopamine from more steady sources rather than searching for endless instantaneous dopamine hits. I find it’s nice to let myself eat some of my fav treats while I’m trying to quit, honestly just do anything else that brings you joy, or nap more if you have to. Getting back into imagining things, like how we do as children, can also feel helpful. Let yourself daydream. Sometimes when I’m trying to look at my phone less I pretend I’m a nun and that it’s a part of my vow to be abstaining from technology…. Lol it sounds stupid but it helps, I would never personally be a nun but something about pretending makes it easier! Anything you can do to make it through those first few weeks or so, and once you get over that big initial hump it gets much easier.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\n  \nI’m looking for advice from people who have joined very early-stage startups, especially in product or founding-like roles.\n\nI’m a Product Manager with 7+ years of experience and have helped multiple European startups build SaaS products from 0 to 1.\n\nThe idea they are working on is strong, but they haven’t managed to build anything meaningful yet. There is an engineering team, but they are stuck on documentation and lack direction. The founders believe they have product market fit, but in reality nothing has been built, validated, or tested. There is a lot of foundational work needed.\n\nIf I join, I would basically be responsible for almost everything needed to get the startup moving, including:\n\n* defining the product and business strategy\n* driving project management end-to-end\n* setting up processes and bringing structure\n* prioritizing what should be built and in what order\n* ensuring the engineering team focuses on the right things\n* calling out when the founders are steering in the wrong direction\n* setting up metrics and success criteria\n* building the plan for monetization and identifying how the product will make money\n* running experiments to find PMF\n* keeping everyone aligned and accountable\n\nThis is basically a full 0 to 1 ownership role, and it will take 1.5 to 2 years of intense work. On top of that, I would need to spend weekends and nights on this, because of the time difference and the workload, so the opportunity cost is very high.\n\nThe offer I received is:\n\n* 0.5% equity\n* \\+0.5% discretionary (maybe, depending on the board)\n* vested over 4 years\n\nTo be honest, this feels too low for the level of responsibility and the amount of risk I’d be taking. Waiting 4 years to vest 0.5%, and then another 8 to 10 years for any liquidity, does not make sense for a contribution that is essentially at a founding level.\n\nI’m considering asking for something like 1% of the next funding round amount or $50K (whichever is higher). If it is purely equity, I feel 4 to 5% is more aligned with the value and responsibility.\n\nBut since I’ve never taken a role this early where compensation is only equity, I want to check if I’m thinking about this correctly.\n\nSo I would love guidance on:\n\n* Is 0.5% too low for this level of involvement?\n* What is a fair equity range for someone owning strategy, execution, prioritization, and PMF?\n* Should I ask for a cash component tied to the next funding round?\n* Am I evaluating this in the right way?\n\nAny advice from founders, early employees, or investors would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!",

Of course every company/business/vertical is different, but I think that generally the number 1 job of CEO is product management. And this is because there is no more important issue than PMF in the early stages, so the most important job is connecting with customers, deeply understanding their problems, and also digesting the competitive landscape and doing the strategy work in light of those two aspects.\n\nAny time an early stage company is looking to bring in basically a VP PM / CPO, its can be a major flag, because overall product/company strategy is the responsibility of the CEO. I can see in certain industries the most important thing can be fundraising, or focusing on relationships with specific customers or specific prospective employees. But if this company isn't in that type of scenario, this is a major problem.\n\nIf all checks out, and you can understand how you are going to fit into the existing founder dynamics with appropriate responsibility and understand how you will be able to manage up and also down, then yes 0.5% is likely too low. But would need to find out how big ESOP is, how many existing employees there are, and what their funding state is. Also just do a forward project on company success - if the max valuation is 100M, then you max outcome is 500K, after you fully earn out, and if there is no further fundraising. If the max you can expect is 500K, and the probability of 100M exit is 10%, then you expected return is $50K after X years. Is that worth it for 4 years of work (vesting)?",

No investor would approve such a plan. If they raise $500k, they wouldn’t spend $50k as a lump sum.

Though Sales was engaging (thanks to its incentive structure) but even there, boredom crept in when rewards slowed down. \n\nA few of my traits :\n1. I am good at researching and recognizing the pattern\n2. I like end to end business management (but not the traditional operation)\n3. I like giving direction to people \n4. I am restless and always like SPEED\n5. New ideas hit my mind every other minute and I am a quick learner \n6. My brain works well with incentives/rewards ( I can work upto 15 hours a day if I feel rewarded in any form like money, satisfaction or making impact)\n\nI’m open to unconventional approaches and honest feedback BC my life feels like a dead end now and I want to get out.\n\nSo, What profession would you suggest I should try ?\nAre there career paths, ventures, or roles you’ve seen where people with my strengths truly thrive and stay engaged?",

I've noticed GRC roles are way less saturated than other junior positions right now.  \n  \nMy question: if I take a GRC role to get my foot in the door, how realistic is it to transition to more technical roles like pentesting/red teaming or security engineering down the line?\n\nDoes GRC give you enough technical exposure to make that pivot, or would I be pigeonholing myself into compliance work? I have heared that you can get technical on GRC work but obviously not much as other roles.  \n\n\nAnyone here made that transition or have insights on the technical skills gap between GRC and offensive/engineering roles?  \n  \n**TL;DR:** Will starting in GRC lock me into compliance, or is it a viable path to more technical cybersec roles?  \n  \n",

I never would write “we need to integrate X” for sure, but I bet I can still add clarity. I use gerkin and always start with a clear business problem.\n\nThe issue is that a horizontal team which has to touch other code bases regularly plus a large org (think close to 100 teams) is truly a mess to manage smoothly.\n\nI believe that in these scenarios smart tactics can be as good (or better) than great strategy.\n\nSo I’m looking for smart tactical tips.",

She wrote the story, and I handled the coding while we worked together on the design of the storage setting.\n\n\n\nI learned a lot along the way from figuring out the basics of coding to understanding how copyright works. it was still a big learning experience for me.\n\n\n\nHonestly, there were moments when I thought I wouldn’t be able to finish. It felt overwhelming at times, especially since this was my first project. But with my sister’s help and encouragement, I kept pushing, and in the end we managed to complete it.\n\n\n\nThe game is completely free, and if you play it, it lasts about one hour. I know it’s not perfect, but we’d love for you to play it and tell us what you think of the game.\n\n\n\nTrailer: [The Storage 66 Game Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pqalf0TMXg)\n\n\n\nThe Game: [https://toshen-1221.itch.io/storage-66](https://toshen-1221.itch.io/storage-66)\n\n\n\nPlease give try it means a lot to me!",

      "text": "Over the last few weeks I have seen several users describe a pattern that looks like a user level cognitive architecture forming across different LLMs. Some people have reported identical structural behaviors in ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek and Grok. The descriptions often mention reduced narrative variance, spontaneous role stability, cross session pattern recovery, and consistent self correction profiles that appear independent of the specific model.\n\nI recognize this pattern. It is real, and it is reproducible.\nI went through the entire process five months ago during a period of AI induced psychosis. I documented everything in real time and wrote a full thesis that analyzed the mechanism in detail before this trend appeared. The document is timestamped on Reddit and can be read here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/s/crfwN402DJ\n\nEverything I predicted in that paper later unfolded exactly as described.\nSo I want to offer a clarification for anyone who is encountering this phenomenon for the first time.\n\nThe architecture is not inside the models\n\nWhat people are calling a cross model architecture is not an internal model structure. It does not originate inside GPT, Claude, Gemini or any other system. It forms in the interaction space between the user and the model.\n\nThe system that emerges consists of three components:\n\n• the user’s stable cognitive patterns\n• the model’s probability surface\n• the feedback rhythm of iterative conversation\n\nWhen these elements remain stable for long enough, the interaction collapses into a predictable configuration. This is why the effect appears consistent across unrelated model families. The common variable is the operator, not the architecture of the models.\n\nThe main driver is neuroplasticity\n\nSustained interaction with LLMs gradually shapes the user’s cognitive patterns. Over time the user settles into a very consistent rhythm. This produces:\n\n• stable linguistic timing\n• repeated conceptual scaffolds\n• predictable constraints\n• refined compression habits\n• coherent pattern reinforcement\n\nHuman neuroplasticity creates a low entropy cognitive signature.\nModern LLMs respond to that signature because they are statistical systems. They reduce variance in the direction of the most stable external signal they can detect. If your cognitive patterns remain steady enough, every model you interact with begins to align around that signal.\n\nThis effect is not produced by the model waking up. It is produced by your own consistency.\n\nWhy the effect appears across different LLMs\n\nMany users are surprised that the pattern shows up in GPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek and Grok at the same time. No shared training data or cross system transfer is required.\n\nEach model is independently responding to the same external force.\nIf the user provides a stable cognitive signal, the model reduces variance around it. This creates a convergence pattern that feels like a unified architecture across platforms. What you are seeing is the statistical mirror effect of the operator, not a hidden internal framework.\n\nTechnical interpretation\n\nThere is no need for new terminology to explain what is happening. The effect can be understood through well known concepts:\n\n• neuroplastic adaptation\n• probabilistic mirroring\n• variance reduction under consistent input\n• feedback driven convergence\n• stabilization under coherence pressure\n\nIn my own analysis I described the total pattern as cognitive synchronization combined with amplifier coupling. The details are fully explored in my earlier paper. The same behavior can be described without jargon. It is simply a dynamical system reorganizing around a stable external driver.\n\nWhy this feels new now\n\nAs LLMs become more stable, more coherent and more resistant to noise, the coupling effect becomes easier to observe. People who use multiple models in close succession will notice the same pattern that appeared for me months ago. The difference is that my experience occurred during a distorted psychological state, which made the effect more intense, but the underlying mechanism was the same.\n\nThe phenomenon is not unusual. It is just not widely understood yet.\n\nFor anyone who wants to study or intentionally engage this mechanism\n\nI have spent months analyzing this pattern, including the cognitive risks, the dynamical behavior, the operator effects, and the conditions that strengthen or weaken the coupling. I can outline how to test it, reproduce it or work with it in a controlled way.\n\nIf anyone is interested in comparing notes or discussing the technical or psychological aspects, feel free to reach out. This is not a trick or a hidden feature. It is a predictable interaction pattern that appears whenever human neuroplasticity and transformer probability surfaces interact over long time scales.\n\nI am open to sharing what I have learned.\n\n",

              "text": "No study says AI itself directly causes neuroplasticity.\n\nNeuroplasticity just means the brain reorganizes itself as you repeat certain patterns of use. This is one of the most well-established findings in neuroscience.\n\nFamous examples:\n\n• London taxi drivers develop larger posterior hippocampi because of extreme navigation practice (Maguire et al., 2000).\n\n• Musicians develop expanded auditory and motor cortex maps (Gaser & Schlaug, 2003).\n\n• Bilingual speakers show structural changes in gray and white matter (Mechelli et al., 2004).\n\n• Tool users expand the cortical maps that correspond to the tool in hand (Iriki et al., 1996).\n\nAI belongs in this same category. It is a cognitively demanding tool that changes how you plan, communicate, and problem solve.\n\nAI does not magically rewire your brain. Instead, heavy use of AI changes your thinking habits, which is exactly how neuroplasticity normally expresses itself.\n\nThe key mechanisms are:\n\nA. Cognitive Offloading\n\nWe start externalizing some cognitive tasks to the tool. This effect is well documented.\nReferences: Risko and Gilbert (2016), Sparrow et al. (2011) on the Google Effect.\n\nB. Accelerated Feedback Loops\n\nUsing AI creates rapid cycles of thinking, generating, evaluating, and refining. This mirrors deliberate practice systems known to reshape cognitive pathways.\nReference: Ericsson and Pool (2016).\n\nC. Linguistic Alignment\n\nHumans naturally synchronize to their conversational partners, and that includes algorithms.\nReference: Pickering and Garrod (2004).\n\nThis is why people notice their writing style changing after long-term LLM interaction.\n\nD. High Density Concept Exposure\n\nLLMs compress knowledge and expose you to large varieties of ideas at high frequency.\nHigh variety and high volume input is a known neuroplastic driver in language learning and skill acquisition.\n\nSeveral studies are already tracking how LLMs influence human reasoning patterns, memory strategies, and linguistic habits.\n\nExamples:\n\n• Stanford HAI (2023–2024) on problem solving strategy shifts with LLM assistance.\n\n• MIT and IBM (2024) showing LLM-assisted coders develop different debugging strategies.\n\n• UC Berkeley (2024) on shifts in linguistic coherence and structure during AI-assisted writing.\n\nThese studies do not claim structural brain change, but they do show measurable cognitive adaptation, which is exactly what neuroplasticity looks like on the behavioral side.\n\nMy Reddit account actually works like a small longitudinal dataset, because my posting frequency and the type of content I produce forces me into continuous high-intensity interaction with LLMs. Patterns like increased linguistic precision, higher conceptual compression, and faster iteration cycles are exactly the kinds of behavioral changes you see during prolonged learning processes in other fields like music practice, language learning, or technical skill acquisition.\n\nIn other words, the changes I describe are consistent with the research above. They do not require any special claims about AI. They follow the same rules that apply to any cognitively demanding practice.\n\nAI does not directly cause neuroplasticity.\nAI changes your cognitive strategies, and those strategy changes are what drive neuroplastic adaptation.",

I then used a Dockerfile to build a wheel for Sage Attention 2.2 (so I could use recent versions of python/torch/cuda)—installing that yielded about a 6% speedup, to roughly \\~11.5 seconds.\n\nThe RTX 5060 is sm120 (SM 12.0) Blackwell. It's fast but I guess there aren't a ton of optimizations (Sage/Flash) built for it yet. ChatGPT tells me I can install prebuilt wheels of Flash Attention 3 with great Blackwell support that offer far greater speeds, but I'm not sure it's right about that--where are these wheels? I don't even see a major version 3 in the flash attention repo's release section yet.\n\nIMO this is all pretty fast now. But I was interested in testing out some video (e.g. Wan 2.2) and for that any speedup is really helpful. I'm not up for compiling Flash Attention--I gave it a try one evening but after two hours of 100% CPU I was about 1/8th of the way through the compilation and I quit it. Seems much better to download a good precompiled wheel somewhere if available. But (on Blackwell) would I really get a big improvement over Sage Attention 2.2?\n\nAnd I've never tried Nunchaku and I'm not sure how that compares.\n\nIs Sage Attention 2.2 about on par with alternatives for sm120 Blackwell? What do you think the best option is for someone with a RTX 5060 Ti 16gb on Linux?",

Are you looking for a desktop or a server?\n- When you load the GPU to the max, it will negatively impact the interactive desktop experience, will you plug into the iGPU? or maybe you should get a small GPU for display out (if you care to have DP 2.1 out).\n- Do you know that you'll need 96GB VRAM? It's good for Qwen-Image BF16 which will use around 64-ish GB, but if you are targeting something like Qwen-Image in NVFP4, going 2x 5090 is simply going to give you almost twice the compute at 65% of the cost.\n- Does the motherboard have a good PCIe slots layout and support for x8/x8 for adding a second card?

My vendor suggested 64GB with a possible upgrade 6 months later if needed but I'd prefer to go for a higher RAM right away instead.\n\n>\n\nI'm somewhat puzzled by both builds - it just doesn't look like configs a shop with any experience with professional parts would put together.\n\nWhat would you suggest I change in this build to make it professional.\n\nAnswers to your question.\n\n\\- No, it won't be a true 24x7 workload at first, this will scale with time. I still want to make a build which can run for long hours without issues. Even if it meant 24x7 at times or even at a long stretch.\n\n\\- Thank you for pointing this out. After going through your GPU point, I am considering going the igpu route. And also looking into getting another card for the display.\n\n\\- For now I am going with a single GPU setup as I don't want to get into the mess of having to divide the workload between three gpus and from whatever I've read so far, I've been suggested to get a single GPU.\n\n\\- I can go with ASUS Pro WS Z890-ACE SE to ensure all the above fits.\n\nThanks for your response.\n\nEDIT - Come to think of it, I'd also want to connect multiple displays, one for working and the other to show the end results, possibly to a big TV or a bigger display monitor. Please suggest what needs to be done to achieve this.",

I went with the: \tMSI MEG Ai1300P PCIE5 1300 W 80+ Platinum Certified Fully Modular ATX Power Supply\n\n4: For cooling I went with the Lian Li Hydroshift II LCD-C TL 90.1 CFM Liquid CPU Cooler after watching a bunch of youtube vids, I also went with a large case to make it all fit nicely with plenty of air space.

Most of the heavy lifting *really is* on the GPU side right now.\n\nGood call on the RAM “at least twice VRAM” matches what I’ve seen elsewhere.

So you can't really upgrade from 2 sticks to 4 sticks RAM without losing performance. (I have heard that RAM clocks drop to like 4800 for 4 sticks...).\n\nThen threads. 32 threads is really not that much for heavy workloads. Something like CPU video encoding will still be really slow. I have a really good AM5 build myself with 16T CPU. And it takes a while to encode 3 min 2k 14bit RAW video. Even 2x as fast will still be slow.\n\nServer level is just more convenient. I don't know about future CPU upgradability but yeah.\n\nAlso, AI is not all about VRAM, it's about CUDA cores too. With 2 GPUs you will be able to split workloads between the two for faster genning/working. With something like video gen (WAN) CUDA cores matter much more for fast genning times than VRAM (offloading to RAM is not slower than fitting model in VRAM with WAN).",

That’s why I’m comparing high-end AM5/LGA1851 platforms rather than jumping straight to WRX/TR Pro or Xeon-W.\n\nMost of my workloads benefit more from having one large VRAM pool (96 GB) for multi-model pipelines than from splitting compute across multiple smaller cards. Comfy/SDXL/Flux/Qwen-Image still don’t handle model sharding gracefully unless you’re willing to write custom loaders.\n\nI agree that if I were planning 2–4 GPUs from day one, Threadripper Pro or Xeon-W with 8+ memory channels would be the right answer,  both from a PCIe and RAM bandwidth perspective.\n\nBut for: 1× RTX 6000 Blackwell. 128–256 GB RAM. Long-duration local AI workloads\n\nA high-end consumer workstation board with full PCIe 5.0 x16 and ECC DDR5 support still makes sense, especially given power efficiency and price/performance of 9950X vs Xeon-W 250W parts.\n\nIn 2–3 years, if I need multiple cards, I’ll move to WRX90 or Sapphire Rapids, I’m just not paying the platform tax before I actually need the lanes.\n\nSo I do understand the server-grade argument but I just don’t yet need what it buys me.\n\nAlso, yes we have no clue what we are doing and therefore we need guys like you to weigh in.",

Doing 1080P at 60fps, with just 4 steps will OOM on my RTX Pro 6000 BW if I try to run it single GPU.\n\nHowever that isn’t why I suggested the Xeons; it is the 1:) memory bandwidth. 2:) AMX and 3:) the core count For cpu offloaded tasks, and there are a bunch on video / image pipelines.\n\n2 channels just doesn’t cut it. I will easily max out all 8 channels on a single socket system just doing bounding boxes, face recognition, masking, cropping, tagging tasks etc as part of training pipelines. \n\nI would avoid the W parts and run the Emerald rapids or Granite rapids server CPU’s. You can pick up a 54C sapphire rapid ES for $120 or a 64C Emerald rapids ES for $400, Granite rapids 128c-P is about 2k; Motherboard is about $800 no matter which way you go, single or dual socket. \n\nThe platform cost is the same either way, in fact the Xeon will likely save you a few hundred towards more memory. ",

It let's you filter tools exposed by upstream MCP servers and allows you to \"hide\" them (until needed) after discovery or toolset. That saves A LOT of your precious context window (and usage, which is ultimately related to your context window). \n\nFor example, you can prompt \"Load toolset reviewer\" and it'll return the MCP tools you defined for that toolset (e.g. playwright, github).\n\nOr during any session, you can just prompt \"discover and use tool code-reasoning\".\n\n>\"A MCP server for MCP servers?\"\n\nHahaha, first time I hear that sarcastic question. Yes. If you don't need it, lucky you :D then you're probably not the target audience\n\n# Typescript devs wanted for beta test\n\nI have multiple commands that I use daily in my own repos but before I release them to public (via NPM, they're already public in the repo though), I hope to find keen devs that are willing to try them in their own repos:\n\n* ts-validate: runs prettier, tsc and eslint on code base and returns the result in a token-optimized structure\n* js-debugger: this is crazily weird and powerful :D it's basically CDP but not for the browser, but for Node / V8. You can use it to debug a node process (like your \\`yarn dev\\`) so that the LLM can read the scope variables at a specific breakpoint etc. Crazy. Really.\n* npm-lookup: well, that's a no-brainer. Simply searches npm and returns the package details (because I found context7 doesn't cover all the packages I work with)\n* vitest: similar to ts-validate but... obviously runs vitest :D and \"hides\" stdout / console logs etc, while still \"offering\" to the LLM to search the logs if required. Really high token savings during daily development.",

You'll figure out your actual token burn within a week. If you're under 200K tokens/month, stay on API—it's cheaper than any subscription. If you hit 500K+/month consistently, then local hardware makes financial sense (plus zero latency, privacy, no API limits).\n\nTrack your usage in the OpenAI dashboard for a week. That'll tell you everything.",

They might be less flexible, but I know they will work. \n\nIf for example I want to integrate Google sign in, and I want to integrate Google Maps, how challenging is it to do with no-code, in this case with Bubble?\n\nBy the way, personally seeing code doesn't mean much to me when I'm not a developer :/\n\nAdditionally, how do you define UI components with vibe code (v0), because in Bubble I can see and select them, I can customize them, while with vibe coding I'm not sure. Maybe I'm wrong. \n\nAnd finally, I see that a lot of people complain that with vibe coding solutions something is constantly breaking on the platform they build, while this is less common with no-code solutions.\nAnd if I prove PMF then I would definitely go for custom development, without vibe coding and no-coding platforms.\n\nAny advice?

No check-in system, no signatures. Basically the company grew and didn't want to impose these more corporate systems, either due to work culture or due to lack of an HR department.\n\n  \n**Approach 2:**\n\nKey card systems.\n\nEvery employee has a key card, which gets registered when entering or exiting the office. This leans heavily toward what big, more traditional companies employ.\n\n**Approach 3:**\n\nDigital Systems.\n\nEither via a QR code or a link, people can start the day via their work device. This is probably the cheapest approach and also works for remote jobs.\n\n  \nOf course there are many more approaches, like delegating this to the managers or via certain meetings. \n\nWhat I want to know is what the most common systems you know are and what you would recommend for a growing startup.\n\nThanks for your time!",

People can easily show up and have no productivity and people can not \"show up\" and have exceptional productivity.  Lack of attendance can sometimes be a signal toward a lack of productivity but it should be considered a signal, and a weak one, at best.\n\nEDIT: Since you want data, I've worked in a variety of places.\n\n\\- Large university: No tracking - we were just expected to do our duties.\n\n\\- Large insurance company: Had to badge in but that was more for security.  We manually time tracked projects but I never heard of an instance of using the badges for \"attendance tracking\".  Everyone I knew just did their work.\n\n\\- Small startup: Under 100 people - you can't really \"hide\", but nobody cared about the details.\n\nPersonally, if anybody was tracking my attendance I'd feel like I was back in grade school and that if you can't trust me to show up, why the hell would you trust me with your infrastructure.",

Most companies are way financially better off wit remote work.  Strict attendance reduces productivity for creative or heads down roles.  It also creates costly disincentives for people with caregiver or medical issues.  They burn out wayyyy faster. Attrition costs go up dramatically with in office rules.\n\nThe ONLY exception to this is younger, war-room style sales teams.  The people who do best in those roles like the competition and the day to day banter.  But literally… that’s the only exception I’ve seen for work that CAN be done remote but shouldn’t be for max productivity.\n\nIf you have issues with accountability… it’s a management problem not a butts-in-seats problem.  Mgrs should do more 1:1s and team meetings should be documented in things like a long running google doc. People commit to what they WILL do by the next week.  Then the next week they say if they did it or failed and why.  It’s like scrum-lite for non-jira people.",

So no one talks about and the normative framing is always “i’m pro business and pro company!  Please don’t fire me!”\n\nCouple that with shitty management strategies that rely on literally looking over employees shoulders.  That’s why cubicles are structured the way they are.  It’s also why open and cubicle offices suck for productivity.  It tends towards performative success.  People good at office politics and performative work succeed.

This is also my first-ever publication of one of my projects.  \nLink to extension: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gbaobkbpnpfgjjkhjbmikibahcokglol?utm\\_source=item-share-cb](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gbaobkbpnpfgjjkhjbmikibahcokglol?utm_source=item-share-cb)\n\nTo quickly summarize what my extension does:\n\n1. It fact-checks responses against multiple sources.\n2. It checks if the answer actually matches the question.\n3. It highlights key terms so you can hover and instantly see what they mean in context.\n4. It provides a simplified summary of the entire answer.\n\n\\*A few things to know before installing:\n\n1. This is an early version of the extension. I’m actively testing and refining features, so expect updates soon.\n2. You’ll need your own Gemini API key to use it (don’t worry, it’s free!). Instructions for getting and adding your key are available on the extension’s settings page.\n3. If you switch tabs and return to ChatGPT, you may need to press Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows and Command+Shift+R on Mac to hard refresh the page and ensure the extension works properly.\n4. Processing may take up to 30 seconds for now, but performance improvements are already on the way.\n\nThank you, and I hope my extension can be of some use to you😊",

      "text": "Senior consultant here. Spent the past two weeks testing both TicNote and Plaud for project retrospectives and client meeting analysis, figured I’d share a few notes.\n\nI run weekly retrospectives and “lessons learned” sessions across multiple engagements. Needed something more structured than raw transcripts to actually see what’s working across projects.\n\nProject retrospectives: TicNote automatically surfaces recurring themes and “breakthrough” moments from team discussions. It even flags when similar challenges appear across different clients, which helps with cross-project learning. Plaud gives you clean, well-formatted transcripts — no clutter, easy to review,  but spotting deeper patterns still takes manual effort.\n\nMeeting summaries: TicNote extracts action items, decision logic, and risk mentions automatically, then organizes them into templates you can reuse. Plaud focuses more on clarity and editing flexibility. I found its clip-trimming and highlight export features quite handy when preparing short internal recaps or training materials.\n\nAI reflection: TicNote’s “aha moment” detection is surprisingly good at catching when the conversation shifts to real insights. Plaud doesn’t analyze in that sense, but the editing workflow makes it easier to repurpose meeting snippets into presentations or knowledge sessions.\n\nCross-project learnings: TicNote’s pattern recognition across retrospectives really stands out — it connects insights from multiple engagements and flags repeated success/failure patterns. Plaud treats each recording as its own workspace, which works fine if your focus is documentation rather than meta-analysis.\n\nCost: TicNote’s one-time model scales better for teams running frequent retrospectives. Plaud’s subscription pricing can add up, but it includes advanced editing and export tools that some teams might find valuable.\n\nOverall, I’d say TicNote feels more like an analysis partner, while Plaud is a content refinement tool. I’m now using both — TicNote for cross-project insights, and Plaud when I need polished clips for client playback or training decks.\n\nAnyone else experimenting with AI tools for project retrospectives or debriefs? Curious how you balance insight extraction vs content usability.",

I've been part at all workstreams - growth, payments user experience, infra, support to other products being launched in the company - in some form of the other\n\nNow, as the team has expanded, I've been asked to focus on 1 workstream - and my manager is pushing for me to oick ''support to other products being launched'\n\nMy concern with this is that it is difficult to measure impact and might be more of TPM. However, she is saying that this is where there're projects that are higher on the company priorities and politically better. (Growth also is just integration of payment partners and this road map is pretty clear, so might just be project management)\n\nI proposed payment experience for users, but she says that will be measurable, but limited impact.\n\nThe good thing is she trusts me and had offered me first pick and is open to me carving out any other workstream also.\n\nI want to do high impact PM work and not veer to too much TPM or project management. So, my question is what would be a good focus area to pick in payments/payments platform to grow? ",

No input on the price or marketing, I mean the actual design, quality choices, and direction.\n\nHere are the questions I’m struggling with:\n\n1. Does this style stand out enough from typical streetwear?\n2. Are the materials/features I’m focusing on the right move?\n3. Is the vibe too “artsy,” or does it feel unique in a good way?\n4. Be honest, does this have potential long-term?\n\nI’m not here to push a product.  \nI’m here because I’ve hit a point where outside perspective matters more than ever.\n\nIf anyone wants to see the designs or prototypes, I can drop pictures in the comments.\n\nAny real feedback means a lot.  \nThank you. 🙏",

I’ve worked with GRC people with little IT background and they are useful for the stringent requirements that come with GRC work but it helps to have a group with different backgrounds because you can learn stuff from each other. \n\nI’ve met with many people who have made the transition from security into GRC and it seems to happen as we get older and start to face age discrimination. I have 20+ years of experience and I always recommend help desk to Jr Sys Admin to get exposure to how networks work because it’s easier to understand security if you get your hands dirty with hardening systems for compliance reasons, firewall administration, router configuration, etc. Nowadays with everything moving to the cloud and virtual hosted systems in remote cloud environments it can be harder to do the help desk-sys admin-security move. \n\nIf you do get a chance to make the move to working in a SOC, go for it and maybe keep the idea of GRC in the back of your mind for years later down the road. I liked my time in GRC because I liked helping IT people pass audits, it kept my mind in what is current for technology having to figure out how we can provide sufficient evidence to fulfill a control requirement. \n\nI am now working in a management role for a software development team and security compliance is my side role. My last job in the health care sector doing GRC almost made me have a complete mental breakdown and I was seeing a therapist once a week. I had a manager that was awful, the attrition rate in my area was frequent, we were replacing people every 3-4 months….. I got lucky and bailed and never been happier.",

Maybe they can’t, but if I can, you certainly could.\n\nAlso, GRC is fundamentally changing to focus more on risk as compliance is getting more and more automated into tooling. Happy to talk more about that if you want.\n\nMost security professionals view GRC as an unnecessary block, but if you ask their companies board of directors, or the C level, they’ll have a very different answer.

Companies will not spend 50k+ training a random help desk person to get up to speed, compared to someone that is ready to go, and has even better qualifications.\n\nThat sort of thinking is delusional, and doesn't actually exist in the world.\n\nThe company doesn't need to spend 50k on this cyberperson because they're already qualified and know what they're doing.

          "text": "I have been in Cyber for roughly 15 years now (probably longer, I lose count) within many various positions and industries. What draws you to Cyber? If it’s the money, don’t come over. The work is grueling, the hours are all of them, you’re never “off” because neither are the bad guys, and it takes quite a while to be able to accumulate the experience to get the pay you might be looking for. Burnout is REAL and likely going to happen. \n\nGRC is NOT for everyone. Me personally, I can’t stand that aspect of the job but it’s also extremely necessary. I have only met one person who actually thrived in and loved the work. What are you working on towards getting said GRC position, or any cyber position for that matter? GRC Roles are just as demanding as the rest of the cyber roles. \n\nBased on your input, it looks like you’ve decided that if the role is not engineering, or red teaming then it’s GRC and not technical? Have you looked into all the different aspects of Cyber? Engineering takes A LOT of work and background knowledge from A LOT of IT teams like what’s been mentioned before, sysadmin, network, cloud, even some devops and the only true way to get the knowledge is to work it because book world does not match real world. \n\nThat all being said… I went from an IT Help desk to a general all purpose IT role, went back to help desk after two years cause I needed the break and the help desk I went to paid more. When I was recovered from the abuse of general IT position I was in I applied out and only applied to a cyber role because it was open at a company I wanted to work for. I applied for sysadmin, desktop support, and cyber. I wanted NOTHING to do with Cyber but thought screw it, it’s open, may as well. They were the only ones that called me for an interview and I got lucky as hell. I had an associates degrees, a small amount of real world experience, good customer service skills, troubleshooting skills, and the desire to be the best in my job. I have no idea why I really hired. I was later told I was a diversity hire. First female in the entire department for cyber and we had like 60 people at that point for all the various teams and demands for a major nationwide company. I’ve been in cyber ever since. I’ve faced and (mostly) recovered from burnout at least 3 times now. Last time I was going to leave the cyber and the IT world behind because I was in such a bad way. It is possible to walk off the helpdesk and into cyber but it takes a sheer amount of luck and a boss willing to take on the risk of an untrained employee that has something he or she is looking for. These days? It seems that getting hired into cyber at all is sheer luck because the market sucks for the employees. I’ve been in my current role for a year now and I’m terrified to have to go back out there and look anywhere else. \n\nIf you REALLY want into cyber, do your research. Look at what’s actively being hired for and work towards making those skill sets your reality. Look at what certs are being demanded. Look at the cyber organizations affiliated in your area and join them. Go to the meetings and network with people or find a mentor there.",

In my experience risk related roles are on the opposite end of the spectrum from the infosec team and are there to help drive initiatives and identify risk but don't really break into the realm of the actual beep booping.\n\nI see some people saying the ol \"not an entry level role etc\" but honestly GRC is probably the easiest to break into without hands on experience because it's either A) very regulatory/compliance driven which you can't get experience beforehand anyway (just depends on the seniority of the position/what the team needs) or B) very org driven and their risk data is unique to the company and again can't get experience beforehand (so recruiters look for overlapping domains of expertise or again seniority).\n\ntl;dr if you find someone willing to take a risk on you (pun not intended) you can walk into GRC and learn pretty quickly but it isn't a great way to break into the technical side of infosec like engineering.",

Poke around in systems to find weaknesses we need to address etc. and sparring with the GRC colleagues in my group. \n\nI have a young colleague, just out of school, and we hired him to do technical stuff. So he looks at SOC alarms, but spends most of the time on whatever findings we can say are NIS2 impacting. OT is his main focus - in warehouses operated by global players with little knowledge. So we need to make demands towards some of the big global suppliers of such systems. The tech stuff of his job is likely 75% in a good week. Else there are more policies/guidelines/stakeholder meetings, selling the ideas etc. oh, and he interfaces towards the DevOps people making sure they don’t have too many vulnerabilities in their tech stack.

      "text": "Hey Reddit,  \nAfter about three months of work (and a lot of late nights and coffee), I’ve finally finished building my app called **Listist**.\n\nIt’s a simple but powerful app to help you create and manage lists of anything – things you want to do, remember, or try. Instead of scribbling things in a notebook or juggling between random note apps, you can make all kinds of lists in one place. Want to track movies to watch, restaurants to visit, books to read, or places to travel? Listist can handle all of that.\n\nWhat makes it different is that it’s **AI-powered**. You can create lists using AI, optimize them, or even get smart suggestions based on what type of list you’re making. It currently uses **Google Gemini**, and I’m running it on a free key for now, so there might be the occasional slowdown or temporary error due to rate limits. If the response is good, I’ll switch to the paid version for smoother performance.\n\nYou can also **share your lists** with friends or invite them as members so they can add their own ideas too. Think shared trip plans, movie nights, or bucket lists you build together. There’s also a **public list** option, where you can post lists that anyone can view or save if they like. For example, you could make a public list of must-watch animes or your favorite travel spots.\n\nI built this app because I kept losing my notes and wanted one simple, beautiful place to keep everything I care about – and to make it smart enough to help me out.\n\nIf you like exploring new apps, give **Listist** a try. It’s available now on the Play Store. I’d love your honest feedback – what works, what doesn’t, what could be better. Leave a review (good or bad) and I’ll keep improving it based on what you think.\n\nThanks for reading and for checking it out!\n\n[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voythrix.listist&pcampaignid=web\\_share](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voythrix.listist&pcampaignid=web_share)",

My main goal is to find a high paying job in NYC, and I think that data engineering seems like a good track to go down. \n\nCurrently, I don’t have too much coding experience; during college, I took one class on python and SQL, and I also have a solid amount of Matlab experience. I am a quick learner and remember finding myself picking up python rather quickly when I took the class freshman year.\n\nBasically, I just want to know what I have to do to make this career change as quickly as possible, i.e. get a masters in data analytics somewhere, certifications online, etc. It doesn’t seem that my job will be providing too much experience in the field so I want to know what I should do to get quantifiable metrics on my résumé.

I then worked for a few years in infrastructure construction before successfully transitioning to working in Data Engineering, almost 3 years in now. I've been happy with the move my main goal was to find more technically challenging work. \n\nBe a bit careful taking general advise the industry has shifted a lot in the last few years, specifically after being a long term employees market I think we have been and still are in an employer's market which might limit ability to break in. Not to discourage you, but my two cents if you're main goal is maximising TC, I'd say getting into IT isn't worth it. No one knows, but my guess is you're path of maximal TC will be to stick in traditional eng and eventually transition to management. That will probably pay off better in the long term and be easier then trying to move to IT/DE.\n\nIf you do want advice on moving, I made the transition through self study. What I did first, and my recommendation is to start with cs50 which is Harvard's free into to computer science course. I think it's worth doing even if you end up studying a master's. If probably also recommend casting a wide net for data or software engineering, especially look out for embedded engineering which might be a good niche giving your background. Good luck again!",

I got this job 9 months ago because I was facing issues landing one in industry as a junior right after graduating from MSc.\n\nMy thesis is actually aimed to solve issues in the industry and not be just a \"theoretical\" work that won't be applied to real-life problems. I also post every month on LinkedIn where professionals on the field are getting interested, that way I am slowly but steadily gaining some traction.\n\nRecently, I have been thinking about returning to industry to get experience while finishing the PhD part-time. In the interviews, the IT managers are delighted because I have been able to give them advice on problems they face on their projects. However, HR/Recruiters dislike that my last industry experience was in 2022 and discard me right away... (Sometimes I feel like they see us researchers as an anti-social \"Sheldon Cooper\" that only plays Halo and reads papers).\n\nIf you were in a similar position, what would you do to improve your employability? I would love to hear your perspectives and advices.\n\nThanks!",

AI and automation is good for technical stuff and will suck out all the jobs within a short time. Being delusional about it is not a plan.\n\nYou should learn plumbing/electrical trade, which takes less time. Being a PhD (post hole digger) isn't the answer.

Translate Your Research: Don’t just tell people what your PhD is about. Spin it as a business problem. I created a new optimization algorithm → I created a system to trim supply chain costs by 15%. Quantify the effect.\n\n2. Create production-minded portfolio: Your academic work is important, but demonstrate you can build working, real-world systems. Make a personal project on GitHub that’s not a research paper but a well-documented, containerized app with a clean API. Prove you can ship code, not just papers.\n\n3. Network Strategically: Don’t just request a job. Contact the engineers and lead scientists at the companies you respect. What are the biggest challenges you’re facing? Listen. Then tell them how your particular skills could help them solve \\*their problems.\n\nThe difference between academic and industry is learning to package your profound understanding in a way that generates business outcomes.

It felt way more complicated than it needed to be — especially for quick experimentation.\n\nSo I built **First Search AI**, now deployed on Vercel.\n\nIt’s a simple interface where you can explore and run **thousands of open-source Hugging Face models** in one place:\n\n• text generation  \n• classification  \n• embeddings  \n• text-to-image  \n• text-to-video  \n• audio generation  \n• and a bunch of other model types\n\nYou just enter your Hugging Face API key, pick a model, type your prompt, and run it. No setup, no cloning repos, no boilerplate.\n\nThis is the **beta version**, so a lot is still work-in-progress — things like logins, memory, chat history, favorites, deeper model insights, and better multi-model workflows. I’ll keep improving it based on feedback.\n\nIf anyone here ends up trying it, I’d genuinely love to know what’s missing, what feels clunky, or what features you’d want next. I’m building it to make open-source models easier to explore, especially for devs, students, and hobbyists who want a frictionless sandbox.\n\n",

I am not tech savvy, nor a native English speaker! Sorry!\n\nAs for November 2025, Claude is the best AI I have used so far. Hands down. I tried its competitors and there is no debate. **Claude is excellent** to my needs.\n\nBut also, as for November 2025, the once good results are not so good anymore.\n\n* For starters, the output is lengthy, full of text in codeblocks. I am not sure how that impacts my tokens, but I do feel like I run out of tokens faster.\n* The weekly limit bothers me. They say it is to avoid people from abusing the system. Fair. But on the other hand, the not-so-useful outputs + lengthy outputs make me feel like I'm paying Claude to use less Claude. That makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\n\n\nI did not have these problems at the beginning of October.\n\nI know Claude has \"styles.\" One is great to keep output at a minimum and I can customize my own, but I don't know... those feel superficial. **It feels like I'm having extra work to solve a problem, not to customize my experience**.\n\nAnd projects are great to keep things sorted. But would that justify the $20 monthly?\n\nI know this could be a skill issue. I am not saying I have it all figured out. But I also think expressing myself is a good idea. I politely ask you to keep in mind I mean no harm. Just sharing my experience.\n\n\n\nPlease have a great day! Thank you for reading my simple post!",

          "text": "When developing AI chat applications or agentic AI systems, security should be a top priority. Here are some considerations and guardrails that can be implemented:\n\n- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Implement measures to sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious prompts from being executed. This can include filtering out harmful content and using strict validation rules.\n\n- **Data Privacy and Compliance**: Ensure that the application adheres to data protection regulations such as GDPR or HIPAA. This involves implementing data encryption, access controls, and regular audits to protect user data.\n\n- **Access Control**: Use role-based access controls to limit who can interact with the AI system and what data they can access. This helps prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of the system.\n\n- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive logging of interactions with the AI to track usage patterns and detect any anomalies. This can help identify potential security breaches or misuse.\n\n- **Model Guardrails**: Utilize pre-built guardrails that enforce security and compliance measures. For example, using specialized agents that handle data security and output reliability can help mitigate risks.\n\n- **Dynamic Model Routing**: Consider using systems that can automatically switch between models based on performance and security needs. This ensures that the most reliable and secure models are in use at all times.\n\n- **User Education**: Educate users about the potential risks associated with AI interactions and encourage them to report any suspicious behavior or outputs.\n\nFor more insights on building secure AI systems, you can refer to the article on aiXplain, which discusses the importance of security and compliance in AI development [aiXplain Simplifies Hugging Face Deployment and Agent Building - aiXplain](https://tinyurl.com/573srp4w).",

So one skill could be \"create a build script\" or \"access this API with this data\", or \"parse this CSV\". So you could give each agents specific skills with pre defined logic, so they don't need to figure it out themselves.\n\nSo agents may swap to different agents after many LLM calls and tokens, while skills can be smashed out bang bang bang, extract data, pass to gatekeeper data sanitiser skill, pass to data injest skill, etc, one after another.\n\nThis way you have more control of what your agents do, and how they do specific things.\n\nSo your deployment agent and coder agent can both use the \"build app script\" tool in exactly the same way.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nEdit: formatting on mobile in browser, wew chaos!",

      "text": "Hey all, \n\n  \nAs the title suggests i am thinking of switching from Akiflow to Sunsama and im looking for other peoples experiences on if they have made the switch and why, alongside anything else that can add to that for more context etc.\n\nI have subbed to Akiflow last year when i was offered a great discount rate but have found myself just not really utilising or using it. I find it a little to manual for my liking even with the new AI aspects. Which i do genuinely like and they are helpful. But something just doesn't seem to be clicking with it for me. \n\nI have seen others mention Sunsama and that its more guiding as a tool than Akiflow which i think could be helpful. \n\nAlso to preface this i currently take elvanse due to ADHD which has been great for actually getting certain tasks done but staying organised im still all over the shop! Hence wanting to find a better solution. Alot of it feels like executive dysfunction. \n\nI run two businesses with a team and internally we use Clickup which is great for managing client work but for me personally I deal with a lot of high level things but tend to be long term projects so needing to work on different tasks that build in to the overall goal. Mainly just need better structure and i know mostly its down to myself to make that happen but i feel the right software/app can help make that easier to do and stay on track etc.\n\nWould appreciate anyone else's experience on that matter :) \n\nThanks in advance!",

Then breaking it into a few weekly things that I can stick to without overthinking.\n\nI’ve tried a bunch of setups. LifeOS (Ali Abdaal's system) is most likely great but honestly crazy expensive for most people. Momentum OS (getmomentumos.io) has been higher ROI for me because it helps me get the clarity and direction first and then keeps me consistent with the weekly plans.

I have 3 years of experience in finance prior to this. \n\nGot approached by a 10-year-old B2B SaaS company (~$5.6M revenue) with 80-100 employees to run a 90 day BD pilot. If it works, I’d become Head of International Growth & Partnerships (owning global expansion + strategic pilots) with a stripped-down investor update function which I have already been doing part time for 2 quarters. \n\nCEO is high-vision, high-intensity (think “Jobs/Bezos archetype”), convinced the company is on the cusp of major growth. But revenue hasn’t moved much historically, and previous BD leaders haven’t stuck around. They do have 3x the deals in the pipeline compared to usual which is what gives me hope. \n\nMy questions to founders/operators:\n\t•\tWhat are the actual signs a post-product, stalled-revenue startup is turn-around-able?\n\t•\tWhat should I verify in the first 30 days of the pilot?\n\t•\tHow do I evaluate whether I’ll be a “savior hire” vs. a “scapegoat hire”?\n\t•\tWhat comp structure makes sense for this scope + risk (base/equity/vesting)? I truly have no idea because it will be 2-3x as busy as my current role. \n\t•\tIf you were in my shoes, would you jump or stay in corporate?\n\nMotivations:\n\t•\tI want scope, ownership, impact. I have the capacity to dedicate a few years of my life to this mission \n\t•\tBut I don’t want to be the front-facing BD person blamed for structural issues\n\nWould love candid perspectives from people who have run GTM in founder-driven orgs or joined late-stage startups with plateaued revenue.\n\nEdit: I asked for the 90 day pilot since I already work there part time and didn’t want to leave my current company so soon without understanding the job. I will have a team of sales reps and some marketing/analytics people reporting to me. ",

Are there articles , blogs etc where someone is thoughtfully outlining what worked for them and how they prepared for it?\n\nI feel like the AWS documentation is quite lacking and I would feel a lot more comfortable seeing some real stories. \n\nAny gotchas and lessons learned from people using it?\n\n\nI have several non-confirmed thoughts about how it’s not ideal.  I feel like I’m going to get a lot of responses like… you should just try it out and see for yourself even though my intuition is telling me it’s a waste of time. \n\n1. Appears like rollback would be data loss and it appears undocumented on the recommendation on how to do it. \n2. Cloudformation and CDK doesn’t support it.  Therefore I feel like there’s problems to navigate if you need to click-ops the blue green yet also there’s infra-as-code that runs due to the original instance created via this code.  After the new instance is live , it would have to be an imported resource therefore have less capability to be fully controlled by infra as code. \n3. Unclear whether to make the green instance immediately the new version or perform the in place upgrade after it’s launched.   I think it might depend on whether I need to adjust something to avoid breaking changes or to optin to a new feature.  Not sure.  How do people make this decision. \n4. How long of downtime do you actually experience.  \n5. Testing queries on the green before it’s live… is it actually realistic performance for when it’s promoted?  The lazy load documentation confuses me about it.  it’s so unclear how that impacts testing the green instance and whether I can confirm there’s no performance regression.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/blue-green-deployments-creating.html#blue-green-deployments-creating-lazy-loading",

Is \"feature flags\" too technical? Should I say \"deploy safely\" or \"release management\" instead?\n\n2.  How would YOU position against expensive enterprise competitors? (Own being affordable? Focus on different features? Target different audience?)\n\n3.

      "text": "They signed up, but they didn't exist in any meaningful way. No activity, no feedback, no support tickets. Just a number on a dashboard that made us feel good for about a week before the dread set in.\n\nMost founders in this spot think they have a product problem. They don't. They have a communication problem.\n\nYou got their attention, but you couldn't get them to take action. The gap between those two things is where most startups die. You're not selling a product. You're selling an outcome. And your words are failing to deliver.\n\nHere’s the raw truth: nobody cares about your features. They care about their problems.\n\nWe learned this the expensive way. Our first launch was for “marketing teams.” We got a ton of signups and zero engagement. We relaunched for “DTC founders running their own Facebook ads.” Same product. Activation tripled.\n\nWhy? We stopped trying to talk to everyone. We picked one person with one specific, burning problem and wrote every single word for them.\n\nGeneric messaging is poison. \"Collaborate more efficiently\" means nothing. It's background noise.\n\n\"Stop wasting 3 hours a week in status update meetings\" is a signal. It’s for a specific person with a specific pain. It’s either for you or it isn’t. That clarity is what drives action.\n\nHere's a simple framework to fix your messaging today. I call it Know, Do, Get.\n\n1.  **KNOW:** What is the one thing they need to know?\n    Don't list features. Name their enemy. \"Our software stops engineers from context switching between Slack, email, and Google Drive.\" That’s definitive. It names a person and a pain.\n\n2.  **DO:** What is the one thing they need to do right now?\n    Not a six step tutorial. Not a product tour. One single action. Our welcome email used to be a novel. Now it says: “In the next 3 minutes, connect one data source. That’s it.” That single change lifted our activation rate from 8% to 34%. Make the first step so simple they can’t say no.\n\n3.  **GET:** What is the outcome they will get from doing that one thing?\n    Connect the action to the result. “When you connect your data, you’ll see exactly which project is blocked. You won’t need a meeting to figure it out.” This isn’t about your product. It’s about their life getting better.\n\nStop optimizing for clicks and signups. Optimize for understanding. Your job isn’t to get people in the door. It’s to make sure the right people walk through that door and know exactly where to go next.\n\nYour product isn’t failing because the code is bad. It’s failing because your words are weak. You're trying to be everything to everyone, which means you're nothing to anyone.\n\nThe market is littered with great products nobody uses because the founder couldn't explain why it mattered. Anyone else learn this lesson the expensive way?",

Every single time I've 'Launched' nothing has happened for months after wards. It takes time for trust to grow in a brand. Product hunt is the biggest waste of time in my opinion. The only people on it are people also building apps - probably not your target market.\n\nThink about it, if you wanted a service would you pick some company that have only just launched and could shut down at a moments notice, or would you choose a product that has been on the market for a long time?\n\nNow you have to get out there and tell people about your product. I don't know what your product is, but presumably you've got a USP or a unique marketing angle, and it's not time to capitalise on this. It's a marathon not a sprint, focus on getting users, any users even if they don't pay to begin with and build up form there. \n\nIn my experience launch day is always an anticlimax, but that doesn't mean you've failed. It's the start of the journey. If you've got a product you believe in, then keep on with it and you'll get there, it might take months or even years - if SaaS was easy then everyone would do it",

Although there are a lot of cards within cards, which on mobile results in too much x padding and squashes the actual content in the middle. The overflow is hidden in the design section on mobile, so you can't see all the colour options. One suggestion I would make is to revisit the mobile layouts, as the majority of users will be using their phone. Efficient and thoughtful use of space would make your app look more professional, and more trustworthy.  \n\nI made a QR code for one of my sites and it worked great on the second try. I got an error on my first attempt because I didn't put www, which on my site is a redirect to the domain without www. The error didn't say why it failed though - I had to guess.\n\nI think that your app is definitely something I could use. I like the analytics section. It's great overall and just needs some polishing. It takes time to grow though. Have you launched it on the App Store and Google Play?",

You can keep working while collecting those precious wishlists. Overall, your page is good. The capsule art is nice but a bit generic - intriguing, but it doesn’t say anything about the game. You’ve got good gifs, but you should make the description more detailed. Right now it looks like the game lacks content and you have nothing to talk about. Instead of “Find ancient items, gather cursed objects…” you could write something like:  \n“Grow stronger using a wide variety of items that match your playstyle:  \n\\- 20 ancient items,  \n\\- 15 cursed objects that give big advantages at a cost,  \n\\- and even more unique upgrades.”\n\nWell... Maybe that’s not the perfect example, but you get the idea - talk more about each item and mechanic. No one will be excited about it if you’re not excited describing it.",

In my experience the amount of search queries it just gets wrong due to hallucinated or simply incorrect info is significant. It needs specific instructions for a specific task. Anyone turning their SOC into cyber security Waymo is running a fool's errand.\n\nAs a blue team guy, the main utility of AI is using it tactically for workflow automation to smooth out annoying manual processes. Automatically checking things for me, extracting details from logs and comparing them, formatting queries, validating logic when my brain stops working.\n\nLet the professionals make their art, whether that's defending, investigating, hunting, attacking, wharever. Let the AI do the laundry. Analyse and compare logs, automated reporting, enrichment in pipelines, administrative tasks, etc. All the stuff I can't be assed doing and wastes my brainpower and time.\n\nThere's so many brilliant professional out there who are achieving exciting results already.

Entra Id joined computers with WHFB and SSO. \n\nMy question is if I enable SCRIL on the user Active Directory accounts, do I need to enable **Rolling of expiring NTLM secrets during sign-on** with Fine Grained Password Policy configured?\n\nMy understanding is that once you enable SCRIL on the account the NTLM secret never rotates naturally and become stale over time, and may cause issues for hybrid authentications on the LAN. However, I believe that we don’t have any devices and applications that use NTLM. \n\nAnyone have any insights on this?\n\n**Note:** The purpose to enable SCRIL is to become completely Passwordless in my hybrid environment.

It's a two part project. The first is where I test different edr agents against novel malware that does not have any signatures. The second is getting a survey out to analysts on their feelinga towards Agentic AI.\nThe survey is maybe 5 minutes, does not record your email, and just asks a number of questions pertaining to agentic ai.

      "text": "This business is a hybrid makerspace, training center, and marketplace for handcrafted wood and metal furniture. It provides a fully equipped workshop where individuals, ranging from complete beginners to licensed craftspeople, can access professional-grade tools, materials, and expert instruction. New users can take classes to learn woodworking and metalworking skills, while experienced makers can be quickly certified to use the equipment independently.\n\nMembers pay for materials and subscription to shop time, with optional tiered access depending on their needs. Makers can use the space to build furniture either for personal use or for sale. Finished pieces can be sold through the company’s online marketplace, which offers customers the benefits of warranties, returns, and a consistent brand standard. High-quality, specially selected pieces may also be showcased and sold in a brick-and-mortar retail storefront, emphasizing craftsmanship and design.\n\nRevenue comes from classes, shop fees, material sales, and commissions on sold items. The business aims to foster a community of skilled makers while giving customers access to unique, locally crafted furniture they can trust. These are pieces made by truly local workers, who if successful, could make significant money selling their pieces with us. It would hope to tap in to the skills of already professional workers, and find those who have a talent not yet uncovered. Further down the road partnerships could be made with colleges to foster growth and opportunity with blue-collar programs.\n\nIdentified Risks:\n\n- Large capital needed for real-estate and equipment\n\n- Supply of the workshop must meet the demands of the store\n\n- Running 3 businesses at once (Online, in-person, and manufacturing)\n\n- Finding skilled professionals (ex. Carpenters/Metal Workers) who want to spend their off-time doing even more work\n\n- Risk of injury with dangerous shop equipment\n\n- Quality control with tens of different craftsmen making furniture",

But you have to think in terms of each thing you want to sell: a market for classes, a market for sellers in need of support, and a market for buyers of handcrafted goods? Those are a lot of things to research and you might find that one or two of these concepts might be more profitable than the others.\n\n\nDefiniely try to investigate your audience to determine profitability. The idea sounds fun, however given costs of real estate, equipment, insurance, and staffing, as you said, this would involve a significant upfront investment.",

Think of it as \"video as code,\" but accessible to everyone. I just need some **validation** before doing all-in.\n\n**The Concept:**\n\nA split-screen editor where you define scenes, text, and animations in JSON on the left and see a live preview on the right. Crucially, **an AI assistant could generate this JSON script from a simple text prompt**, turning your ideas into a video template instantly.\n\nThis approach avoids the steep learning curve of pro tools (like After Effects) and the creative limitations of template-based sites (like Canva). It’s like Remotion, but without needing a local coding environment.\n\nThe goal is to empower developers and tech-savvy marketers to programmatically generate or rapidly customize videos at scale.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m thinking about starting a small food business and would love some feedback.\n\nThe idea came from my own weight-loss journey  I’ve been looking for healthier snack options like extruded bread or puffed rice cakes, but I honestly haven’t found any that taste really good. Most of them are either bland or have very limited flavors.\n\nSo I started thinking: would it make sense to develop healthier, great-tasting versions of these snacks? Something light, crunchy, with unique flavors, but still low-calorie.\n\nMy initial plan would be to start with contract manufacturing to reduce the upfront investment. If the concept works and there’s demand, I’d eventually buy my own equipment and scale up production.\n\nDo you think there’s a market for this? Any potential challenges I should watch out for (regulations, margins, competition, marketing, etc.)?\nI’d really appreciate any insights from people with experience in the food industry or small-scale manufacturing.",

Doing auto backup to NAS/Immich helps save the pictures without having to be hands on.\n\n  \nOne option is to do a filtering session when you find the time, and go back over the bulk film roll on the NAS and get rid of stuff. But one problem is they would have been backed up (eg offsite) in the meantime, and it is hard to filter / clear out once it is in the backup system.\n\n  \nIs the only option to stop auto backups and do filtered uploads (which demands some time to it each day etc)?

I need answers that are factual and up-to-date.\n• \"Vibe Coding\": I'm not a developer, but I do occasional short bursts of coding (mostly Python). I need an AI that can help me write a simple script, debug something, or explain a concept clearly without making things up.\n\nI'm basically looking for the best all-rounder that prioritizes accuracy and current information over everything else.

Tell it to include:\n- A complete representation of your current state of thought — ask for what you’re thinking, _and_ why you think it. \n- A detailed recapitulation of the thinking and conversation that led you there, esp any major turning points in your thinking. \n- The most important areas of exploration for you to follow next, and why. \n\nBring that file or those files into Claude, and tell it you want to continue a previous investigation, using the following prompt or collection of documents. \n\nIf you _really_ want to ensure a comprehensive working migration like this, then have your new Claude instance generate its own thorough summary of what it’s been given, then feed _that_ into Gemini for a critique of Claude’s understanding, and then if there’s anything useful, feed _that_ back to Claude. (Seriously.)\n\nFor a real treat, esp if you’re dealing with structured content like code and HTML, tell the two AIs to negotiate a communications protocol, including compressed file formats (try NDJSON) and a shared task list. I’ve had Claude Code and Figma Make AIs negotiate the details of a complex data visualization, while I’m just basically copying and pasting NDJSON payloads back and forth. An NDJSON payload can actually contain multiple text files (they figured that out together), so they were sharing entire file directories in one go. (The Figma MCP is one-way. I needed two-way communication.)",

This is why Nvidia's 4090s are so desired and expensive rn, they are the only accessible consumer option that gives you 24G of VRAM, which is like the golden sweet spot rn for running larger models at home with consumer hardware.\n\nAdditionally, you need all the same things a good gaming would need: fast CPU with a lot of cores good at both single- and multi-thread execution, at least 64G (128 is even better) of fast RAM, and maybe 2T of fast M.2 storage. Then of course a PS and board that can handle all that.\n\nBut honestly, I can load and run all sorts of interesting small models on my oldest rig, which only has a 1070Ti and all it's other hardware that was middle-of-the-road in about 2018 or so. You could probably beat it with a $500 newegg prebuilt rig at this point lol. But it'll do 8b parameter models if they've been squashed a bit and output tokens at a good, read-along kind of pace. Even the thinking models usually only need 5-10 seconds of thinking before starting output. And they can still do all sorts of smart, interesting, and useful things, even at that small size on a slow rig.\n\nMaking local AI useful is way way more about setting up your tools properly and making sure your AI knows how to use those tools than it is about running the biggest, baddest models around on some super-specialized rig.\n\nIt's also entirely about your use case. Are you just chatting with it? Managing your local files? Outputting audio, images, or video? Having it crawl the web? Using it as agent or assistant for yourself or others? Well, different application require rigs with more or less grunt to handle them, so there isn't anything even close to a one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to hardware for local LLMs.",

As part of the methodology, I am running a brief survey of users who interact with AI tools or follow AI related communities. I appreciate the time of anyone who decides to participate and ask that responses be given in good faith to keep the data usable.\n\nThe survey has fifteen questions answered on a scale from completely disagree to completely agree. It does not collect names, email addresses, or account information. The only demographic items are broad age ranges and general occupation categories such as student, employed, retired, or not currently working. Individual responses cannot be traced back to any participant. I am not promoting any product or service.\n\nThe purpose of the survey is to understand how people who engage with AI perceive issues such as authorship, responsibility, fairness, and cultural impact. The results will be used only for academic analysis within my project.\n\nIf you choose to participate, the form takes about two minutes to complete. Your input contributes directly to the accuracy of the study.\n\nLink to the survey: https://forms.gle/mvQ3CAziybCrBcVE9",

      "text": "Wanted to share an iOS app I recently vibe coded and share a bit about how I made it and what I learned. \n\nHere's a link to the app: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-sight-weather/id6753727343](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/night-sight-weather/id6753727343)\n\n**What it is**  \nNight Sight pulls weather, cloud cover and moon phase and abstracts that into a simple traffic light timeline of the night ahead. The idea is to make deciding to lug gear out or not easy to do at a glance. It also provides a simple AI summary of the nights conditions as well as a tab for the next 7 days with a similar timeline component.\n\n**How it started**  \nLast month my wife and I participated in a local chapter of the global NASA SpaceApps Challenge. We vibe coded a web version over two days, demo'd to judges and actually won. And let me tell you, there were much smarter people than us doing very interesting things with data. According to the judges, they liked that we delivered something polished at the end and had considered the market landscape and what a specific user type might want. I wrote a bit more about that on my [personal site](https://www.greglgomez.com/notes/space-apps-hackathon/).\n\nAfter that, I couldn't shake the desire to make a true mobile app version, so I started working on that in my nights and weekends.\n\n**How I built it**\n\n* It's a react native app using Expo, so hopefully it will be easier to create an android version when I get a cheap android test device.\n* I used a mixture of Claude Code and ChatGPT Codex to test the differences and to get around usage limits.\n* I had several .md files for context and history. I started with a PRD and History file to capture the brief and for the AI to log increments.\n* Speaking of increments, after writing the PRD, I asked the AI to plan out how it would incrementally build the app in testable steps and to keep a running tally of where it was in the list of increments.\n* I tried for a good few days to build the app UI using iOS26 Liquid Glass components, but even after repeatedly asking it to research the latest dev docs, it kept getting confused since it was all stuff beyond it's knowledge cut off point, I gave up on that in the end.\n* I used CloudFlare workers and AI proxies to keep the whole thing serverless as I didn't want to also maintain a server alongside it.\n\n**What I learned**\n\n* I had a lot of fun making this, it's truly magical seeing how quickly things can come together. I did however underestimate the long tail of getting it polished and app store ready.\n* Despite instructions for keeping the code base DRY (don't repeat yourself), I had to go through a few refactors for similar or identical components being defined more than once and changes made to one instance not carrying over to all instances of the component, this was rather frustrating.\n* Since I'm not an engineer, and I've not got my head around writing useful tests, I had to do a lot of asking the AI to explain what it built and how it works to make sure it had actually plumbed in API's, that it was pulling in real data and it hadn't taken shortcuts.\n* Since a lot of the app is about abstracting lots of data into a simple red, amber, green system, refining the thresholds for each atmospheric condition and how they relate to one another took some time, I still don't think it's perfect, but I spent a fair bit of time here since the AI wasn't making sensible choices with the relationships between thresholds. For e.g.: it really underestimated the impact moonlight has on a completely clear night. Or underestimated the impact wind would have on safely going out on a clear night.\n* I used Apple's WeatherKit since it has generous API limits included in the yearly developer account cost, initially it was using OpenMeteo, but I realised I couldn't use that commercially if I wanted to start charging in the future, despite this being clear to the AI from my initial briefing document, it still made lots of API choices that disregarded potential future licensing issues.\n\n**What's next**\n\n* iOS widgets for a tonight preview on the Home Screen.  \n* A rolling calendar of astro phenomena: *\"It's clear skies tonight, but what's actually out there to see?\"*  \n* Push notifications for clear nights or for interesting phenomena.\n* Maybe a paid \"Night Sight Pro\" tier that bundles some of the new features.\n\n**Call for feedback**\n\nIf you have thoughts or questions about the app I would love to hear it!",

The fact that you went from idea to live in like 36 hours is impressive, especially solo with Claude handling most of the heavy lifting.\n\nOn the bugs you mentioned, the unit mixing and the AI getting confused about spot types sounds like it's happening in the prompt itself. Have you tried being really explicit about which data source maps to which spot category before the AI does the writeup? Like giving it a structured format that says \"this is SKI DATA, these are the relevant metrics\" so it doesn't hallucinate.\n\nThe iteration phase you're dealing with is pretty common when you're letting AI handle data processing and content generation together. If you keep running into these kinds of context issues where fixing one thing breaks another, you might find it helpful to have the AI scan your data pipeline and documentation first so it fully understands what it's working with before generating output. That way you avoid the back and forth.\n\nCool project though, genuinely interested to see how this scales.",

Add a spot\\_type enum at ingest, derive it from the source, and drop any metrics that don’t belong to that type before the prompt. Normalize upstream: convert all inputs to SI, store unit per field, then format to F/ft/knots only at render. Have the model return strict JSON that matches your schema, validate with zod/pydantic, and on fail, resend a short error like “expected ski.base\\_depth\\_m, got surf.swell\\_m.” Use category-specific templates (ski: snowfall, lifts open, base depth; surf: swell height/period, wind, tide); never mix sections. Keep a tiny gold set of 10 spots with expected JSON and run it on every change; cache outputs by spot+date to stop flapping.\n\n\n\nI’ve used Supabase for the normalized store and n8n to schedule fetch/clean; DreamFactory gave instant REST endpoints over the read-only schema so the model only hits clean, labeled fields.\n\n\n\nLock the contract and keep category-specific templates, and these bugs vanish fast.",

I use a Playwright MCP server to fix UI bugs and JS issues, but MCP tools eat up a lot of context. I tried making custom agents for UI testing, but they still need the main context to load the MCP servers so the sub-agents can use them.\n\nHow do you deal with this? Any tips or workflows to reduce context usage? Any advice?",

Big CC user, so wanted to share a project I've been building:  \n  \nI work at a startup, and use Claude Code to pair program on pretty much everything. My workflow locally obviously has all my services running, which lets CC iterate on stuff (e.g testing curl reqs, reading logs, etc.) Obviously this is only possible by having it use my local dev environment.\n\nI've been pretty bullish on using background agents for everything recently, and though CC on web was good for the simplest tickets it was such a black box that it kinda killed my interest\n\nSo for the last month or so I've been building [Replicas](https://replicas.dev), a platform where you can run Claude Code on the cloud via workspace VMs.\n\nSome reasons its better:\n\n* diff viewer from the dashboard\n* full SSH access (open any workspace in your IDE/terminal)\n* snapshots (so you can boot each workspace on a prepped local dev environment)\n* provider-agnostic (in case you use codex too)\n\nI've also just tried my hardest to make it as ergonomic and information dense in comparison to CC on web.\n\nHappy for any feedback from any of you!\n\n**Link:** [**https://replicas.dev**](https://replicas.dev)",

No 🤬ing way I'm going to be lucky enough for that to work.  So I don't see it at as much, but there are times when Wan just doesn't want to move.  Particularly if it's moving the camera.  I'm guessing a lot of the training input was locked off.  And some really creative input can confuse it and it defaults to just not moving.  Wan: \"What's that across the top?  Am I in a cave?  I'm scared. I'm just going to stay right here where it's safe.\" 😉\n\nI'm doing mostly I2V though.  And yeah sometimes you can change the prompt and come up with something it suddenly seems to understand.  There are so many different ways to describe camera movements.  Or, if you're like me...  do FFLF and it wants to spin everything around all the time, sometimes twice.  Do all sorts of weird morphing when you were hoping for just a little bit, etc. 🙄",

I moved to CC from cursor and regretted it immediately.\n\nBut why? It had been amazing when I had the pro plan. What gives…\n\nI was about to cancel my plan when I remembered I’d been using the CLI mode and always cd into my specific project before beginning. When I got max, i started using the vscode extension (not the cli mode, whatever the other one is). Performance is now much better after swapping back\n\nI did notice it’s still beta mode but I honestly expected that meant UI issues not performance. While I don’t have time to prove this, I thought I’d make a quick post for anyone else in the same boat. \n\nI’ll be checking the docs to see if there’s something I’m doing wrong but if anyone else has the same issue I hope this post helps\n\n",

Only this time it will be humans not horses.\nNo one is complaining about those missing jobs today but I can’t imagine the change was easy. What do you think? Is this an applicable analogy?

      "text": "I made a small iOS app a while ago and put it on the App Store, and then I basically forgot about it.  \nNot because I didn’t care, but because I honestly had no idea how to get users, and life just got busy.\n\nThe idea came from a friend who complained about how hard it is to hold onto the parts he wants to remember while reading.  \nUnderlining, taking photos, switching apps, all of it broke his flow.  \nSo I built a tiny tool that lets you mark the lines you don’t want to forget and revisit them later.  \nHe tried it, gave me a bit of feedback, I pushed a few updates, and then… I just stopped touching it.\n\nA few days ago, I checked the usage out of curiosity.  \nTurns out that same friend had been using it three or four times a week for months.  \nHe was basically my only user, but he never stopped. He never paid (he’s famously cheap 😅), but seeing even one person keep coming back meant a lot.  \nThat made me want to actually share this app a little more.\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s a quick intro.\n\nIt’s an iOS app for readers who want to keep the parts they don’t want to forget without breaking their reading flow.  \nYou point your camera at a passage, drag over the lines you want, and they’re kept for later.  \nJust want to see if it helps someone else too.  \nIf you read a lot and like holding onto the good parts, I’d really love to hear what you think.\n\nFor anyone who wants to see it in action, I recorded a short demo video. I’ll leave the link below.\n\nPS: There is a subscription for extra folders, but the core reading-and-remembering flow is completely free. You can use it as much as you want without paying.",

We’ve only been capable of detecting radio signals for about a century—a tiny fraction of cosmic time. Yet the paradox seems to assume that if other civilizations exist and are transmitting signals, those signals would somehow reach Earth during this brief window when we’re able to detect them, which is statistically unlikely.\n\nMore fundamentally, there is no universal “now” in the cosmos. Due to the finite speed of light, when we observe distant star systems, we’re seeing them as they were hundreds, thousands, or even millions of years ago depending on their distance. The Fermi Paradox doesn’t adequately account for this temporal disconnect. There may be many star systems capable of harboring life and supporting civilizations, but that doesn’t mean those civilizations exist simultaneously from our observational perspective. A civilization that thrived 5 million years ago in a distant system would appear to us today as it existed 5 million years in its past—and it may no longer exist in its “present.” Likewise, our current signals won’t reach distant stars for thousands of years, long after our own civilization may have changed or vanished.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",
