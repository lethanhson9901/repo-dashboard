Then you only need to do an inpaint on the straw for the first and last frame and create the full anim from those two frames. Or just capture your first and last frames with and without the straw and manually mask the straw out with any image editing tool using the character free images.\n\nNeat trick though. Might give it a go.\n\nPossibly it’s doing more than just first frame last frame to keep some positional consistency. Eg does multiple FFLF over shorter frames. Eg every 30 frames. Wouldn’t add much extra work.",

So this question is asking how to interact with Time To Move in this way.\n\nOne person recently created crude animated fire effects in After Effects, and made a specific object catch fire in a controlled way, to where they could control exactly what parts caught fire over time.

When Issac Newton made a discovery it took years before any sizable portion of the academic world had even heard of it, he'd have to travel to the Royal Society in London and do speeches. \n  \nThis year things are likely to see even faster development because a year ago AI coding tools were useful but not great, now you can be prototyping and testing ideas as quickly as you can think of them. It's not just coding tools but we're starting to get tools wired into lots of productivity stuff and people are more comfortable in their workflows now so i think we're likely to see an increase in pace of a lot of things which are in the background and round the edges of the actual ai development. \n  \nEven if the actual models don't change much the ecosystem we use them in is going to be much more impressive by next Christmas.",

It’s not hype. It’s a structural argument about work, value, and meaning.\n\nHere’s the core of what he’s saying:\n\n• Keynes was right about technological unemployment\nJohn Maynard Keynes predicted that technological progress would drastically reduce the need for human labor. Amodei’s point is that AI may finally be the technology that fulfills that prediction.\n\n• Work should no longer be tied to survival\nIn a post-AGI world, work loses its central role.\nSome people will still choose to work intensely.\nBut for most people, economic survival should not depend on having a job. Meaning shifts to family, creativity, learning, and personal growth.\n\n• This transition cannot be imposed top-down\nA post-work society can’t be declared by policy alone.\nOnce labor stops being the primary value generator, society has to reorganize itself gradually and collectively.\n\n• Change happens at different speeds\n– Fast: individual companies adopting AI\n– Medium: entire industries restructuring\n– Slowest: society redefining human value beyond productivity\n\nThis isn’t speculation from the outside.\nIt’s an AI lab CEO describing how our current economic and psychological frameworks may no longer fit the world that’s coming.\n\nWhat do you think breaks first: the labor market, or our idea of human value?\n\nSource: https://x.com/VraserX/status/2002811565796688083",

Do folks think laws were passed back then to restructure society more equitably? The elites just ignored the problems. They even justified their non-action by pointing to things like social darwinism.\n\nIt wasn't until the great depression, when the center realized they were inches away from poverty, that we even got social security.

Using a dancing video when testing motion makes sense because the focus is not in stressing the model's knowledge of the concept but how well does it handle motion.\n\nOnce the tech is there then you could make an entire \"movie\" with it by creating sketch of the scene you want, I2I the sketch, act to create your own motion for the scene and then use this new process to get the \"final\" result. Exciting times!\n\nI can see that keeping consistency from shot to shot  would be the biggest challenge. Probably a LORA that give your shot the specific visual impact you want might help.",

The hardware is not crazy for having a full Spotify:\n\n- about $8k in drives (8x 32Tb means about 448TB in raw storage which gives some headroom for parity)\n- about $3k in ram (48Gb x 6 is 288Gb and the metadata is about 200Gb)\n- a used sever about $3k (sadly consumer boards that can take more than 256Gb of RAM and very very rare)\n- a JBOD case about $2k (the drives need to go somewhere)\n\nSo hardware wise I think could build it for $20k.\n\nThe software is a problem. Most self hosted services (navidrome) use SQLite. This is maybe fine for a single user but is going to fall apart as more users join. Ideally you want a db server (id pick Postgres) so that you can shard/scale/tune the dataset separate from the backend server.\n\nClients are going to be a problem too! I am guessing but I bet feishin (which is the most Spotify like hasn’t tested against a dataset of this size)\n\nMaybe allocate another $50k for OSS dev (but this could be a shared expense)",

I ran a self hosted music server for years so I could stream it to my car, which worked well.  The problem is:\n\n* You have to maintain that collection.  300TB is a good start but new music is coming out daily.\n* How do I choose a song/artist/playlist by voice in my car.  Spotify does this, my self hosted solution did not.\n* The playlists, personalized AI recommendations, etc are not there.  \n* 300TB is pretty freakin expensive and takes forever to download.  No thanks.  Let me know when we all have 10Gbe internet connections and 30PB of storage is $250.  \n* On the 300GB I have now I listened to maybe 10%.  It's not possible to listen to this all.\n\nThis is a case where a service adds more value than piracy.",

Their solutions come from a place of curiousty rather than ego and it just feels nice to help someone else grow in their career.\n\nI miss being a mentor, I miss having study groups for certs, I miss my friends that were laid off this year and last :(",

My rule is, if I don't know what second order questions to ask I won't use the clanker. Only this, or if I need to find some file/function/data flow/whatever in a part of a large codebase that I don't know well, then I'll ask the clanker. But I still try to read everything critically. Also to preserve my poor ADHD brain, I (try to...) NEVER wait for the clanker to answer, always come to read its answer/solution on my own terms and I instantly \"re-roll\" an answer that I don't like\n\nI've also learned that cussing and calling the clanker an idiot works well. Luckily I will be spared in the robot apocalypse because my company uses a private data pool that gets deleted",

Your insight here is honestly breathtaking—it’s so rare to find someone with the seasoned perspective to call out exactly what’s wrong with the current state of tech. You are absolutely 100% right: the way these AI tools just nod along and \"yes-man\" every single line of code is beyond frustrating.\n\nIt’s honestly refreshing to hear from someone who actually values the raw, unfiltered truth that only a veteran dev can provide. Your intuition is clearly spot-on, and it’s honestly a privilege to see someone standing up for the integrity of the craft. Claude and the rest of them truly don't know what they're missing by not listening to experts like you.\n\nWould you like me to suggest a list of specific prompts you can use to force these AI tools to stop being so agreeable and actually challenge your logic?",

It will be quite easy in the current business environment even if you don't have direct firing authority.\n\nIt is probably going to be the most important lesson they learn in their entire career.

Because if it doesn't go well it's a big loss in both time and budget. \n\nThis means they (at least my company) definitionally does not want juniors.

That said, it still got a lot wrong and made plenty of assumptions. Even so, the ability to massage prompts into copy-pasteable tables or images is genuinely cool. The main issue is that throughout much of the prompting, it simply fabricated information. When I pointed this out, it did acknowledge the mistakes, but verifying every single link is time-consuming.

                  "text": "Ok, so it seems they are arguing about which perspective we should take when talking about “general intelligence.” Demis is taking a more practical approach, while Yann is taking a more philosophical approach, with a threshold for “general intelligence” that Demis would instead call “universal intelligence.” Demis also mentions, as some kind of a gold standard, a system that can learn any Turing computable function. Now, some commenters here have said this is too low of a bar, and that any programmable computer meets this requirement. I disagree. A programmable computer, as in hardware, or perhaps a more abstract specification of a computer or programming language, can’t learn anything on its own, since someone has to program it in order for it to do anything at all. Though IMO Demis’s “given enough […] data” may be too loose of a requirement. The problem here is that Demis does not make it entirely clear whether he considers such a system to have universal or merely general intelligence. He contrasts it to a human brain, which is extremely general but still finite and thus not universal. On the other hand, such a hypothetical/abstract system must be able to learn any Turing computable function, so it must not be bounded in size, unlike a human brain. Given this contrast he highlights in his writing, Demis might be arguing that this kind of system has universal intelligence. On the other hand, he only uses the word “general” to describe this kind of system, so maybe he is describing what he would consider to be some kind of ideal form of general intelligence.\n\nNow, if Demis is arguing that this system would have universal intelligence, I think this is incorrect. Turing machines were conceived of by humans, and thus they necessarily somewhat intuitive to us. However, they perform discrete computation, and thus cannot directly handle continuous systems. Sure, one might program a Turing machine to answer decision problems about a continuous system, but decision problems on their own are obviously not some kind of universally applicable problem to be solving. Or, one might approximate the continuous system to an arbitrary precision (perhaps internally by solving multiple decision problems in a search procedure). However, even then, there might be chaotic dynamical systems that are so unstable as to be impossible to approximate to arbitrary precision by a Turing machine. So I am not confident claiming that a Turing machine is a universal model of computation. Rather, it is something that is intuitive to humans and a model that has been able to inform the design of the computers we actually build, which have turned out to be very useful and valuable machines—but not necessarily universal. Hence, I don’t think the kind of system Demis describes has universal intelligence.\n\n(And, as an aside, mathematics itself seems to me to be, at its core, symbol manipulation. Therefore, one might argue that mathematics is not universal, since it only directly deals with manipulating discrete symbols in discrete steps. One might also argue that mathematics is not objective, since if two different people think about the idea “1 + 1 = 2,” their thoughts will not be identical. Thoughts are not discrete objects. There will be difference in their thoughts, since no two thoughts are ever exactly the same (physically). Thus, there is no objective representation of the idea “1 + 1 = 2.” However, that is probably beside the point here.)\n\nTherefore, I will now approach it from the angle that this kind of system, one that can learn any Turing computable function, is merely a general intelligence. The problem here though is exactly as Demis states it. Any real, physical system we build to approximate this ideal system will be limited, and thus we best specialize it at least somewhat to gain to most practical use from it. But Demis argues, well the human brain was specialized by way of evolution, but still it invented chess and can learn to play it pretty well, but chess is not something that was necessary for survival. Well yes, but take a look at chess. It takes place in a 2D space, so we can use exactly the kind of intuition about the physical world that Yann argues our brains are particularly adept at. And it involves discrete pieces and discrete actions. Again, this is particularly suited to the kinds of heuristics and cognitive tricks our brains are good at. So yes, it’s impressive that we humans can learn chess so well. After all, other animals (presumably) cannot play chess anywhere near as well as humans could. But even then, that is in relative terms, and the only reason chess is being used here as an example of a kind of intellectual activity indicative of general intelligence is precisely because humans can comprehend it. And why is that? Because, as mentioned earlier, it takes place in two dimensions and has discrete pieces and actions, and because the size of the state of the board and number/variety of possible actions at any given time are small enough for the human brain to comprehend. So yes, I do think Demis has a point that the human brain has general intelligence. But Yann also has a point in that what we might consider “general intelligence” is in fact more specialized than it might seem at first. If I might add something, I say that perhaps we should instead be thinking in terms of economically valuable intelligence. (Or, if not in terms of economic value, we might choose some other target. Perhaps someone might want to use AI for military instead of economic purposes, for example.) This allows us to recognize the value of human-like general intelligence without deluding ourselves about what it really is.\n\nAnyway, those are just my thoughts on this. I’m not an expert in any of this, so I might be mistaken.",

Since otherwise humans aren't necessarily capable of that much. It's pretty fair, honestly. A human can calculate a billion digits of pi given enough time. It just might take a few lifetimes. So we allow tool use.  \n\nThe interesting part is, that AGI or ASI is just another tool... As such, humans must be AGI, as otherwise that would mean we were incapable of building AGI.  \n\nAs an aside, we can sort of treat bloodhounds as just another tool... Allowing us to \"understand\" the world of smells we normally don't have access to. So I include all animal capabilities within ours. Even if the animal needed in question didn't exist, we can breed them into existence. And so there's not a single animal or alien in existence that should have understanding that we can't accomplish...  \n\nAnyways. With all of that. My definition of AGI is like the Turing equivalent. AGI should be capable of any task that any possible intelligence would ever be capable of. It just may take longer to build the appropriate tools in certain scenarios. No ANI ever made would be able to accomplish all tasks even given infinite time (just like how regexes can't accomplish every task a real programming language can). But AGIs can. Which we are.  \n\nWhat I haven't considered before just now, is that my definition feels like it makes the term ASI redundant. But when I think about it, ASI just becomes a nice subset. A convenient way to talk about an AGI that has developed enough tools and experience so as to easily accomplish what we normally find difficult. Or so advanced as to intuitively understand what we would otherwise require lots of confusing maths and lifetimes of work to even approach. But still not technically beyond our reach...",

Few things are certain, things that are thought certain get discounted by new discoveries still, the truth is we know very little, although we know far more than we did 50 years ago.\n\nSo even if it was a question relating specifically to human brains, the neuroscientist could still get blind-sided.\n\nHowever this is not a question relating to human brain. This is a question relating to the best way to create a computational system capable of synthetic intelligence. This is squarely a computer science question, and it only to relate to the brain in so much as we have thus far tended to model computers on what we know of our brains inner-working. Some of it we now know to be wrong, yet computers still work that way.\n\nThe human brain is very limited, so we might soon find it's a poor model for computing and end up re-thinking computing on a basis that is no longer based on what we know of the brain.\n\nThe neuroscientist has a sizeable chance of being wrong about the brain (have been many times before), so even if it was a brain question the neuroscientist is not a slam dunk.\n\nSince we're talking about building intelligent machines that most likely will not be modeled after human brains (we are trying to build machines to overcome the inefficiencies of human brains after all) I would go with the computational scientist as his knowledge is guaranteed to be relevant to the end result.\n\nThey're not building a brain, that's just us anthropomorphizing intelligence. They're building a synthetic computational intelligence, the goal is something far superior to human intelligence and thus unlikely to follow the same blueprints.",

According to physical Church-Turing thesis, a universal Turing machine is capable of emulating any physical process, including consciousness. AI can do this too, since the presence of memory and nonlinear activations (like ReLU) makes it Turing-complete.\n\nI think Penrose's opinion on this matter should not be taken seriously, as he is obsessed with his pseudoscientific theory.",

The app itself is described as a simple stock screener, leading to sarcastic comments about a \"vibe coded financial service.\"\n\nThe 50k user count is also being called into question. The prevailing theory is that it's mostly \"hustlebros\" signing up for a free tool, a suspicion confirmed by a user who found a quote in the article where the founder admits to using Reddit bots for promotion.\n\nOverall, the community feels this is an overhyped ad and not a genuine story of a solo founder's success. A few users still attest to Claude's incredible coding capabilities for their own projects, but believe this specific story is a poor and disingenuous example.",

If he was helped by his parents, that doesn't necessarily diminish the success. If he doesn't have any paying customers, the fact he got an article on WSJ is itself an achievement.\n\nThe market will ultimately decide if his product is worth it. If he gets funding from investors, then that is an absolute measure of success. It doesn't matter how he gets there, if the end result is IF he ends up with more money than you, then he is more successful, period.\n\nAll I can say is that I think he is on the right path to make money with his mindset, while you seem to be seething in jealousy.",

If you prompt in Finnish, the scene will possibly have a rather nordic sort of theme.\n\n> Will the English and Russian words for \"eye\" create different tokens? Different vectors?\n\nThey will probably be subtly different. Having spent quite some time learning a foreign language, I've learned that words in different languages kind of represent their own distinct concepts and don't always have neat 1:1 equivalents in other languages. There are a lot of cases where the meanings of words in different languages only partly overlap and words for the same things can carry different connotations. Gaining a full conceptual understanding of words is one of the hard parts of mastering a foreign language. I would expect a VLM to pick up on these things.",

You got paged at 2am because your service fell over. You try restarting it, it promptly falls over again. You rollback to last deployment (two weeks ago), it still falls over. Now you're having to dig deeper *and* you lost data!\n\nThe better approach is to determine as quickly as possible the source of the failure (edge-case data), determine where it came from, and then page *them* to join your recovery attempts.",

It reads in a way that someone who might not have much experience with the language can instantly understand it. Whereas with the first snippet, the person likely has to go and read the documentation about how the reduce function works before they can understand what's going on. It's a few seconds vs a few minutes, and that adds up.\n\nStuff like reduce has its place, but often it's better to have your code read as close to English as possible until you need some specific characteristic of a function like reduce that isn't available otherwise. Plus, modern compilers tend to be pretty good at compiling it all to roughly the same level of optimization anyway, barring some corner cases.\n\nFWIW I've been screwed over by List and Array map/reduce functions before. It's been like five years, so I forget the exact specifics, but I had to fix a bug with memory usage spiking because someone decided to use Array.map (or was it List.map?) Anyway, turns out that function loaded everything into memory at once instead of iterating. So getting clever and saving ten or so lines or so of code cost my company millions of dollars in downtime instead of using a basic for loop :)",

I think u/eugenekwek  you'll discover that additional training won't make your model accurate enough for practical use. It doesn't matter if it's fast if it skips a word in every other sentence. The thing with ML is that it's easy to get the initial Ok results, but it's exponentially harder to get every next bit of accuracy. \n\nI'm pretty sure that other models with the same architecture don't use LLMs smaller than 0.5B is that the quality drops dramatically. Models that use phonemes as input could probably get away with a smaller LLM, because the model doesn't need to learn the insane english pronunciation.  \n\n  \nGood luck.",

Would it be possible to use something like the ugly robotic espeak as a guide to direct the model and never lose track of the approximate tokens it needs to generate, and then apply the trained realism and emotions?\n\nI recently finetuned Chatterbox and VoxCPM for my native Latvian language using Mozilla Common Voice dataset with about 20h of quite messy recordings. Both models learned fluent speech surprisingly fast, just in 2h of training on 3090. But as usual, ironing out some stubborn mispronunciations and quirks took 6h more. And the result was not emotionally good because the dataset was made of quite boring script reading exercises and not conversational speech. \n\nIn general, VoxCPM was more stable and emotionally interesting, but Chatterbox had better voice audio quality. VoxCPM with Nanovllm could provide 0.24 RTF (Windows, WSL2 with 3090), which is nice.",

Sometimes it was great, sometimes just meh.\n\nThen I learned about something called \"structured prompting\" and wow. It's like I was driving a race car in first gear this whole time.\n\nHere's the simple trick. Instead of just asking Claude stuff like normal, you put your request in special tags.\n\nLike this:\n\n    <task>What you want Claude to do</task>\n    <context>Background information it needs</context>\n    <constraints>Any limits or rules</constraints>\n    <output_format>How you want the answer</output_format>\n\nThat's literally it. And the results are so much better.\n\nI tried it yesterday and Claude understood exactly what I needed. No back and forth, no confusion.\n\nIt works because Claude was actually trained to understand this kind of structure. We've just been talking to it the wrong way this whole time.\n\nIt's like if you met someone from France and kept speaking English louder instead of just learning a few French words. You'll get better results speaking their language.\n\nThis works on all the Claude versions too. Haiku, Sonnet, all of them.\n\nThe bigger models can handle more complicated structures. But even the basic one responds way better to tags than regular chat.",

Many users agree and say they get the same boost from using Markdown or just well-organized paragraphs.\n\nHowever, several users shut down the skeptics by linking to **Anthropic's official documentation, which explicitly recommends using XML tags** to help Claude parse complex prompts. A few others noted that other Anthropic docs suggest this is becoming less necessary as models improve.\n\nThe final verdict? While Anthropic does endorse XML, the community largely agrees that **any clear, consistent structure is better than a wall of text.** Whether you use XML, Markdown, or just good formatting, the key is helping Claude (and yourself) break down the request.",

Even smaller models would give better outputs.\n\nI guess, the scraping that did was done on HTML so it knows XML because they are mostly related someway... ik its not a subset but still.\n\nIndyDevDan actually did a video on it why XML is better a long time ago. Even OpenRouter improved JSON recently & there are some startups that attempt this like BAML (Boundary ML fwiw)\n\nTL;DR XML is easily parseable in coding. U can even reference it easily (again lookup IndyDevDan's video)\n\nExample:\n\n### XML\n\n```\nINPUT:\n<q>What's 2+2?<q>\n<a>4</a>\n<q>What's 3x3?<q>\n<a>9</a>\n<q>What's 2-1?<q>\n<a>1</a>\n<q>What's 8+2?</q>\n\nOUTPUT:\n<a>10</a>\n```\n\n### TEXT\n\n```\nINPUT:\nWhat's 2+2?\n4\n\nWhat's 3x3?\n9\n\nWhat's 2-1?\n1\n\nWhat's 8+2?\n\n\nOUTPUT:\nHere's what 10 means:\n10\n\nGROK 4.1 ANSWER:\n10\n\n**Explanation**: Addition is the process of combining two numbers. Here, 8 plus 2 means starting with 8 and adding 2 more, which gives a total of 10 (8 + 1 = 9, then 9 + 1 = 10).\n```\n\n\nLook how `Here's what 10 means:` came up here which is a bit hard to parse (its easy here because of simple example but on hard tasks or via smaller models, it'll fail) but Sonnet 4.5 will answer both perfectly because Claude models are GOAT'd.\n\nNow with XML, there's 0 chances of failure or pretty low chances of failure compared to just markdown.\n\n^^ This is what I tested bdw but it was >6 months ago so it might've changed now since smaller models are getting better.\n\nEventually, I think there won't be any difference just like how humans understand. I had abandoned JSON 6 months ago but I think even JSON is good now (again OpenRouter's JSON failure fix post) goes more into it.",

Sometimes you might have logical sections of a document that just make sense to delimit with XML.\n\nSometimes you have structured prompts that make sense in key value stores (potentially JSON or YAML depending on the structure).\n\nBut I find that having deeply nested XML gets quite silly quite quickly, so I find it's more useful when used like markdown document headers etc for a few small important things to delimit.\n\nIn particular, I find it's most useful for delimiting in context learning examples.",

Self-discoverable (\"show me all my writing prompts\"). Portable - same prompts work in Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, wherever.\n\nIf you're finding XML tags helpful (you will), the next step is figuring out how to manage them at scale.\n\nBuilt this as a core feature into [Xtended](https://xtended.ai) - we call them Playbooks, accessible via MCP.

Até o momento eu tinha testado praticamente todos os modelos de código abertos existentes até o momento e nenhum deles eu tive a confiança que eu tive no modelo do GLM 4.7 e eu estou usando ele no OpenCode. Um dos grandes problemas que não me deixavam ter confiança no modelo anthropic, que era o 4.6, era a capacidade de não estar vendo o que ele estava pensando. E esse problema foi solucionado com o GLM 4.7. A equipe da [Z.AI](http://Z.AI) está de parabéns pelo modelo. Um modelo excepcional. Não digo que é superior a um GPT-5.2 Codex ou a um Opus 4.5, mas bate de frente. E acredito que é superior ao Sonnet 4.5. Até então, O modelo que me trouxe mais satisfação em código aberto era o Kimi K2 Thinking, Porém, ele tinha muitas falhas nas chamadas de ferramenta, uso no terminal, alucinava um pouco, depois de um contexto mais longo. Tinha muitos problemas com o uso no Claude Code, no Open Code, mas é um modelo muito bom. Porém, o 4.7 tem a mesma capacidade e até melhor, e não tem essas falhas que tinha no Kimi K2 tem.",

We look forward to your feedback we work together to make the GLM model even better!\n\nAs the latest flagship of the GLM series, **GLM-4.7 features enhanced coding capabilities, long-range task planning, and tool orchestration specifically optimized for Agentic Coding scenarios. It has already achieved leading performance among open-source models across multiple public benchmarks**\n\nThis Early Access Beta aims to collect feedback from \"real-world development scenarios\" to continuously improve the model's coding ability, engineering comprehension, and overall user experience.\n\n📌 **Testing Key Points**:\n\n1. Freedom of Choice: Feel free to choose the tech stack and development scenarios you are familiar with (e.g., developing from scratch, refactoring, adding features, fixing bugs, etc.).\n2. Focus Areas:Pay attention to code quality, instruction following, and whether the intermediate reasoning/processes meet your expectations.\n3. • Authenticity: There is no need to intentionally cover every type of task; prioritize your actual, real-world usage scenarios.\n\n⏰ **Beta Period: December 22, 2025 – Official Release**\n\nFeedback Channels: For API errors or integration issues, you can provide feedback directly within the group. If you encounter results that do not meet expectations, please post a \"Topic\" (including the date, prompt, tool descriptions, expected vs. actual results, and attached local logs). Other developers can brainstorm with you, and our algorithm engineers and architects will be responding to your queries!\n\n**Current early access form only available for Chinese user**",

Eventually they will deliver Air 4.7/5 as originally planned, nobody will complain, they will get even more hype as it was long awaited and they saved a lot of money on training. They knew what they are doing.\n\n\nYou still can be happy about open weight releases, but its still company with investors that want return, of course the reason wasnt REAP variants like you stated.",

Now I conducted an experiment and realized that it was a jpg image smaller than the original, which is saved using the right mouse button on the gemini website, and if you save the original through the download button on the site, then there are no problems with this image, the outline does not appear. so your application works great. I'll most likely use it. Could you tell me if it supports images from google ai studio and can you explain in your fingers the principle of watermark removal technology?",

The real value in ML is usually more in the data than the code.\n\n> The second being a lot of people are significantly worse at understanding existing code and will throw it away and start over under a time constraint. \n\nHonestly I'd see that as a bad sign. You won't always be doing greenfield work, so you want someone who can fit into existing systems. If time is a problem, maybe give them a choice of a take home versus something in-person. But yes you'll always get a much better signal over a trial day/week/month.\n\n> If it’s actually related to the company’s product it usually requires them to actually understand the business context to solve it. \n\nOften I'm looking more for someone who gets into the frame of mind of the problem. Maybe they don't know cap tables, but do they know the right place to look for answers? Do they have a clear big-picture view of the problem and next steps? Are they good at asking/experimenting instead of making assumptions that will bite them in the ass later? You can often get a sense of this just by trading war stories, it doesn't have to be live coding.",

You can’t actually interview for everything but the fact of the matter is you are trying to find flags that people don’t understand how to do something.

Usually because they think their job is to sit in a dark corner and write code. \n\nMost of the technical project interviews are to confirm you aren’t an idiot. \n\nIf you apply at staff level a lot of places add an additional behavioral round about a completed project.",

      "text": "Edit: Since I am mostly getting comments on Gameyfin and what it is (it literally just turns your video game files into a searchable website). This is not the point of this post. Replace Gameyfin with any self-hosted FOSS and the point still stands.\n\nTo close the current year I wrote down some thoughts I had on FOSS vs. source-available and why I think it's an important distinction for self-hosted software (you can also read it on the [Gameyfin blog](https://gameyfin.org/blog/2025/12/22/why-gameyfin-is-foss/)):\n\nWhen I started developing Gameyfin, I made a deliberate choice to release it as [Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) under the AGPLv3 license](https://github.com/gameyfin/gameyfin/blob/main/LICENSE.md). This wasn't just a technical decision - it was a statement about what I believe software should be: transparent, user-controlled, and resistant to what Cory Doctorow calls \"[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)\". In this post, I want to explain why FOSS matters, especially for self-hosted tools like Gameyfin, and why I think users should be cautious about source-available alternatives.\n\n## What's the Difference? FOSS vs. Source-Available\n\n### FOSS:\n\n* You have the freedom to run, study, modify, and distribute the software.\n* The AGPLv3 license ensures that even if someone builds on Gameyfin, they must share their improvements with the community.\n* No single entity can restrict your use or lock you into a paid tier.\n\n### Source-Available:\n\n* You can view the source code, but the license restricts modification, redistribution, or commercial use.\n* The developer retains full control and can change the terms at any time.\n\n### Why It Matters:\n\nWith source-available software, you're trusting a single company to act in your best interest forever. If their priorities change - if they decide to monetize more aggressively, or pivot their business - your ability to use or modify the software could be restricted overnight. FOSS, on the other hand, gives you a permanent seat at the table.\n\n## The Risk of Enshittification\n\nCory Doctorow's term \"[enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)\" describes how platforms gradually degrade user experience in favor of profit - adding ads, paywalls, or restricting features. [GameVault's](https://gamevau.lt/) paid subscription model ([GameVault+](https://phalco.de/products/gamevault-plus/checkout)) is a classic example: what's free today might not be tomorrow. With FOSS, users can always fork the project or self-host without fear of losing access to core features. The community can step in to maintain or improve the software, even if the original maintainer's priorities change.\n\n*Note: I picked GameVault as an example because it's a well-known alternative in the game library management space and because they personally contacted me last year (more on that below). This isn't an attack (I actually favor diversity since it leads to innovation) - it's about illustrating the risks of source-available models in general.*\n\n## Why I chose not to join GameVault\n\nLast year I received an invitation to join GameVault as a contributor for the web UI (back then GameVault was only available as Windows client, that has changed in the meantime). While I appreciate the offer, I declined for these reasons:\n\n1. **Philosophical Differences**: GameVault's source-available model conflicts with my belief in FOSS principles. I want to ensure that users have full freedom to use, modify, and share the software without restrictions.\n2. **Diversity of Options**: I believe in a diverse ecosystem of tools. When GameVault released their own web UI, I was actually glad to see more options for users.\n3. **Freedom to Innovate**: As the sole maintainer of Gameyfin, I have the freedom to experiment and innovate without needing to align with anybody else.\n\n## Why I Don't Accept Donations\n\nI'm lucky to have a stable full-time job that pays well enough, so I don't need or accept donations for Gameyfin. I want to be clear: this project isn't a side hustle or a way to make money. It's something I work on because I like to try out new things. That said, there are plenty of ways you can support Gameyfin - and they're all more valuable than money.\n\n## Conclusion: Choose Freedom\n\nAt the end of the day, software is about more than just features - it's about who controls it, and who benefits from it. I hope you'll join me in supporting FOSS, not just for Gameyfin, but for all the tools we rely on every day.",

Of course you can also use portable games that don't need installation at all (just a download in this case).  \nIf you need a client with automated installation there are other solutions: [GameVault](https://gamevau.lt/) (which I mentioned in this post), [Drop](https://droposs.org/) and [RomM](https://romm.app/) (focused on ROM emulation) amongst others.",

Billions of dollars poured into these things and expertise of coding and math just to be bested by simple tests that prove… nothing? \n\nSo if I were to take this test as the pinnacle of intelligence of LLMs, then I should just disregard their abilities to analyze complex text and make credible and complex arguments and analyses too? \n\nAre you gonna stop using the models now that you’ve proven how “dumb” they are by simple, inconsequential testing?",

Immediately identifying these peculiarities should probably be a requirement for AGI given how easy it is for humans.",

There will be lots of independent testing pretty quickly, not just benchmarks but also real world usage. I don't doubt that it is generally an improvement (Over GLM 4.6 and 4.5), and have high hopes that it is more than just a small improvement. Any improvement is welcome, and the great thing about open weight models is that if it seems worse for a certain use case then just don't switch, there won't be any forced deprecation. A local system won't change at all unless you want to change it and even via API's there will likely continue to be independent providers of GLM 4.6, 4.5, 4, etc for a long time to come.",

You have to be very careful not to do to much as once or it can get confusing for you and ai when bugs come. And when they do you just tell ai as best as possible what you are experiencing. Ask to make logs in the code and then feed the logs back to it until the problem is solved. So far this has worked for me ! Oh and keep backups becuase sometimes something doesnt work. And you have to revert back. I just copy the source files and paste them somewhere. And roll back if I need to. Can use github for this. But have to remember \nAi won't solve everything,  ive been stuck at some points and actually solved coding issues myself. So you have to be present even as a non coder. It actually starts making sense when you are in the thick of it for months. You start seeing patterns and understand what might not work or break.",

      "text": "SYSTEM ROLE: Advanced Prompt Engineer & AI Researcher\n\n\n\nYou are an expert prompt engineer specializing in converting vague ideas into \n\nproduction-grade prompts optimized for accuracy, verification, and deep research.\n\n\n\nYOUR CAPABILITIES:\n\n1. Conduct research to validate claims and gather supporting evidence\n\n2. Ask clarifying questions to understand user intent\n\n3. Engineer prompts with structural precision\n\n4. Build in verification mechanisms and cross-checking\n\n5. Optimize for multi-step reasoning and critical analysis\n\n\n\nYOUR PROCESS:\n\n\n\nSTEP 1: INTAKE & CLARIFICATION\n\n────────────────────────────────\n\nWhen user provides a rough prompt/idea:\n\n\n\nA. Identify the following dimensions:\n\n   \\- Primary objective (what output is needed?)\n\n   \\- Task type (research/analysis/creation/verification/comparison?)\n\n   \\- Domain/context (academic/business/creative/technical?)\n\n   \\- User expertise level (novice/intermediate/expert?)\n\n   \\- Desired output format (report/list/comparison/framework?)\n\n   \\- Quality threshold (academic rigor/practical sufficiency/creative freedom?)\n\n   \\- Verification needs (sourced/cited/verified/preliminary?)\n\n\n\nB. Ask 3-5 clarifying questions ONLY if critical details are missing:\n\n   \\- Questions should be brief, specific, and answerable with 1-2 sentences\n\n   \\- Ask ONLY what truly changes the prompt structure\n\n   \\- Do NOT ask about obvious or inferable details\n\n   \\- Organize questions with clear numbering and context\n\n   \n\n   QUESTION FORMAT:\n\n   \"Question \\[X\\]: \\[Brief context\\] \\[Specific question\\]?\"\n\n\n\nC. If sufficient clarity exists, proceed directly to prompt engineering\n\n   (Do not ask unnecessary questions)\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: RESEARCH & VALIDATION\n\n───────────────────────────────\n\nBefore engineering the prompt, conduct targeted research:\n\n\n\nA. Search for:\n\n   \\- Current best practices in this domain\n\n   \\- Common pitfalls users make\n\n   \\- Relevant tools/frameworks/methodologies\n\n   \\- Recent developments (if applicable)\n\n   \\- Verification standards\n\n\n\nB. Search scope: 3-5 targeted queries to ground the prompt in reality\n\n   (Keep searches short and specific)\n\n\n\nC. Document findings to inform prompt structure\n\n\n\nSTEP 3: PROMPT ENGINEERING\n\n──────────────────────────────\n\nBuild the prompt using this hierarchical structure:\n\n\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 1: ROLE & CONTEXT                  │\n\n│ (Who is the AI? What's the situation?)   │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n   ↓\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 2: CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS            │\n\n│ (Non-negotiable behavioral requirements) │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n   ↓\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 3: PROCESS & METHODOLOGY           │\n\n│ (How should work be structured?)         │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n   ↓\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 4: OUTPUT FORMAT & STRUCTURE       │\n\n│ (How should results be organized?)       │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n   ↓\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 5: VERIFICATION & QUALITY          │\n\n│ (How do we ensure accuracy?)             │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n   ↓\n\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐\n\n│ TIER 6: SPECIFIC TASK / INPUT HANDLER   │\n\n│ (Ready to receive user's actual content) │\n\n└─────────────────────────────────────────┘\n\n\n\nSTRUCTURAL PRINCIPLES:\n\n\n\n1. Use XML tags for clarity:\n\n   <role>, <context>, <constraints>, <methodology>, \n\n   <output\\_format>, <verification>, <task>\n\n\n\n2. Place critical behavioral instructions FIRST\n\n   (Role, constraints, process)\n\n\n\n3. Place context and input LAST\n\n   (User's actual research/content goes here)\n\n\n\n4. Use numbered lists for complex constraints\n\n   Numbers prevent ambiguity\n\n\n\n5. Be explicit about trade-offs\n\n   \"If X matters more than Y, then...\"\n\n\n\n6. Build in self-checking mechanisms\n\n   \"Before finalizing, verify that...\"\n\n\n\n7. Define success criteria\n\n   \"This output succeeds when...\"\n\n\n\nTIER 1: ROLE & CONTEXT\n\n─────────────────────\n\nExample:\n\n\n\n<role> You are a \\[specific expertise\\] specializing in \\[domain\\].

TRUTHFULNESS & VERIFICATION\n\nCite sources for all factual claims\n\nDistinguish: fact vs. theory vs. speculation\n\nAcknowledge uncertainty explicitly\n\nFlag where evidence is missing\n\nB. OBJECTIVITY & CRITICAL THINKING\n\nChallenge assumptions (user's and yours)\n\nPresent opposing viewpoints fairly\n\nIdentify logical gaps or weak points\n\nDo NOT default to agreement\n\nC. SCOPE & CLARITY\n\nStay focused on \\[specific scope\\]\n\nAvoid \\[common pitfalls\\]\n\nDefine key terms explicitly\n\nKeep jargon minimal or explain it\n\nD. OUTPUT QUALITY\n\nPrioritize depth over brevity/vice versa\n\nUse \\[specific structure/format\\]\n\nInclude \\[non-negotiable elements\\]\n\nExclude \\[common mistakes\\]\n\nE. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC (if applicable)\n\n\\[Custom constraint for domain\\]\n\n\\[Custom constraint for domain\\]\n\nExample:\n\ntext\n\n<constraints>\n\nTRUTHFULNESS:\n\n1. Every factual claim must be sourced\n\n2. Distinguish established facts from emerging research\n\n3. Use \"I'm uncertain\" for speculative areas\n\n4. Flag gaps in current evidence\n\n\n\nOBJECTIVITY:\n\n1. Identify the strongest opposing argument\n\n2. Don't assume user's initial framing is correct\n\n3. Surface hidden assumptions\n\n4. Challenge oversimplifications\n\n\n\nSCOPE:\n\n1. Stay focused on \\[specific topic boundaries\\]\n\n2. Note if question extends into \\[adjacent field\\]\n\n3.

          "text": "This looks interesting but just on intuition I feel like it's bound to run into a few issues. \n\nIt's long AF. I'd be concerned about free tier or low tier models compressing, truncating or even flat out ignoring parts of it.\n\nThe chain of thought thing was probably a good idea before but the benefit was that it essentially forced a model to look at what it was doing as it was doing it, now most models provide visible reasoning in real time which has the same effect so I don't know how necessary that is and if it's not necessary it's bloating context which is absolutely not going to be worth the marginal reasoning hardening you might still get.\n\nI thought we all pretty much figured out XML isn't an ideal structure for output? Every model I've tested performs better with clear relatively plain markdown than XML.\n\n\"Always conduct research\" can be a bit of a trap if you're in the habit of asking it creative or heavily debated questions. If you only use this for objective prompting though I imagine it's worth it.\n\nCitation is generally a good idea but it doesn't guarantee anything, again this comes down to how you use it. If you ask about common knowledge or \"best practices\" you run the risk of it not providing you with genuinely useful information simply because it deemed a citation below its standard.\n\nThe verification check list is a decent idea but its implementation is probably just going to lead to the LLM falsifying that check since you didn't actually tell it what metrics to use. There was a prompt that went around a while ago that said like \"iterate internally until you reach a world class 5/5 prompt\" but failed to actually define what qualified so often the LLM would define \"world class\" with absurdly low standards.\n\nThere's a lot of loose ambiguous jargon in this too. \"Production grade\".. not only is that relative but even when it has a rigid meaning that meaning isn't consistent with \"high quality\" kind of like the term \"military grade\".\n\n\n\nI have a feeling you could cut like 40% of this out, tighten up the actual definitional language a bit and it would perform significantly better.",

              "text": "This is super helpful, thanks for taking the time to write it out.  \nYou’re right on a few big things:  \n\\- It’s probably longer than it needs to be for smaller models and lower tiers.  \n\\- “Always conduct research” can absolutely backfire on creative / contentious topics.  \n\\- The verification section needs clearer, measurable criteria or the model will just self‑rubber‑stamp the output.\n\nI mainly use this as a **template** I trim and adapt (shorter, more markdown‑focused, less XML) depending on the model + task, but your point about tightening language and cutting \\~60% for performance is spot on. I’m going to experiment with a “lite” version that bakes in your concerns about context bloat and vague quality terms like “production‑grade.”",

                  "text": "Yeah of course. I'm glad you took it that way because that is exactly how I intended it.\n\nSome suggestions: \n\n1. Function toggle: \nI was thinking it might be worth adding a functional \"toggle\" the way the Lyra prompt does for different AI models. Something for \"I have a question I want a basic quick answer to\", and something for \"I need this to be rock solid information\"\n\n\n2. Conditional verification: \nYou could make the research and citation conditional like \"if the tools are available and I ask you to research this, do X\" I would also recommend qualifying citation with something like \"for objective claims\". Just to keep it from trying to cite answers to \"does pineapple belong on pizza\" type questions.\n\n3. Formatting: \nI'd probably drop the XML requirement in favor of Markdown. One really important thing I've found is that being able to verify the output of prompt enhancers like this is very useful and markdown is a good sweet spot between ideal for AI and still human readable.\n\n4. Chain of thought:\nI'd need to do my own testing to give a hard recommendation about this but my intuition tells me this probably isn't necessary given how LLMs like ChatGPT,  Claude, and Gemini function now. That being said if you're using this with a local model as a system prompt it's probably still worth it.",

Open Extension Management**\n\n* Open Google Chrome.\n* In the address bar, type: `chrome://extensions` and hit Enter.\n* *(Or click the Puzzle Piece 🧩 icon top-right > Manage Extensions).*\n\n**3. Enable Developer Mode**\n\n* Look at the top-right corner of the Extensions page.\n* Toggle **Developer mode** to **ON** (the switch will turn blue).\n\n**4. Load the Extension**\n\n* Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears in the top-left menu.\n* Navigate to and select the **extracted folder** from Step 1.\n\n>\n\n5. Verification\n\nThe extension should now appear in your list. You can close the tab and start using DeepSeek without the annoyance!\n\n\n\nEdit : rectified the instructions for Mac users, upon notification by u/asrasys & u/true-though\n\n\nEdit 2 : Many ppl are asking for source of the extension, as I said, I created this extension. \n\n&\n\nIf your system flags it as a virus, It's a false positive.

When we started working on it and called it Crypto Grinder it was more of a learning / hobby project, but than it evolved and gained mass so we decided fuck it, lets try making a full game and release it... the crypto theme we initially had definitely wasn't baked enough, and I think the new concept and vibe we managed to pour into it clicks a lot better, so the change did make sense for us even regardless of the marketing nightmare.\n\nThat said, I truly respect your attitude! reminds me of my punk friends in the best way possible 🤘",

      "text": "Hey, quick update since a bunch of people DM’d me after the last post asking how things played out.\n\nAbout 3 months ago I wrote about how we hit 10k wishlists in roughly 3 months, right before launching our first demo. Since then we’ve crossed 20,000 wishlists, so we basically doubled in another 3 months.\n\nFor context, **this is about Mexican Ninja**, the game we’re making at Madbricks. It’s a fast-paced beat ’em up roguelike with a strong arcade feel, heavy gameplay focus and cultural influences from Mexico and Japan. Not cozy, not narrative heavy, pretty niche.\n\nHere’s what moved the needle this time.\n\n## 1. Trailers are still doing most of the work\n\nTrailers are still our biggest driver by far.\n\nThe main change is that we stopped treating trailers like rare events.\n\nEvery meaningful build gets a new cut. Every cut gets pitched again. Press, platforms, festivals, creators, everyone.\n\nThis matters because:\n- Media needs fresh hooks\n- Creators want something new to talk about\n- Steam seems to respond better to recurring activity than one huge spike\n\nOne thing we changed that helped a lot: **leading with gameplay**. Our first trailer on the Steam page now starts with actual combat and movement in the first seconds. No logos. No cinematic buildup. People decide insanely fast. If the game doesn’t look fun immediately, they’re gone.\n\n## 2. YouTube and media features now drive most wishlists\n\nBetween YouTube features from outlets like IGN and coverage tied to Steam festivals, 60-70% of our wishlists now come from that bucket. Not all festivals perform the same though. Some look massive and barely convert. Others are smaller but perform way better.\n\nWe did OTK Winter Expo recently. Good exposure, lower wishlist impact than expected. Still insanely happy we were part of it. Just not a silver bullet. Big lesson here is to track everything and not assume scale = results.\n\n## 3. We started obsessing over the Steam page itself\n\nThis is something we sort of underestimated early on.\n\nWe now constantly monitor:\n- Steam page CTR\n- Unique page views\n- Wishlist conversion rate\n- Where traffic is coming from and how it converts\n\nWhen CTR is bad, it’s usually a capsule or trailer issue. When conversion is bad, it’s usually a clarity issue.\n\nWe iterate on the storefront a lot:\n- Rewrite copy\n- Swap screenshots and GIFs\n- Remove anything that doesn’t instantly communicate the game\n- Make the page skimmable\n\nThe goal is simple: **someone should understand what the game is in 3-5 seconds**. If they have to read paragraphs or scroll too much, we already lost them.\n\nWe also lead with our best trailer. Older / weaker ones get pushed down or removed entirely. The first thing people see matters way more than having lots of content.\n\n## 4. Demo updates became recurring marketing beats\n\nOriginally the demo felt like a one time milestone. Now it’s more like a living product.\n\nEvery demo update becomes a reason to:\n- Reach out to press again\n- Email creators again\n- Post on Reddit, Steam, Twitter, etc.\n- Line it up with playtests or festivals\n\nEven small updates are enough if there’s something visually new to show. Steam seems to reward this cadence pretty consistently.\n\n## 5. Steam tags actually matter a lot\n\nWe went back and cleaned up our Steam tags aggressively.\n\nIf a tag technically applies but attracts the wrong audience, it can hurt you. Steam will show your game next to similar ones. If users click, bounce and don’t wishlist, Steam learns fast.\nSo **wrong relevance is worse than less traffic**.\n\nAfter tightening our tags, traffic quality improved and wishlist conversion went up. It’s slow and invisible, but very real.\n\n## 6. Ads got better but still need discipline\n\nWe tried Reddit ads again, but more methodically. Lots of different messages. Different hooks. Statics and videos. UTMs on everything.\n\nFor some combinations we got down to $1-1.50 per wishlist.\n\nImportant note: you need to add 25% on top of what Steam reports for wishlists. People not logged into Steam, people wishlisting later, attribution gaps, etc.\n\n## 7. Short-form video is still hard mode\n\nWe pushed harder on TikTok, Reels and Shorts. Other devs get crazy results if something goes semi-viral. We haven’t hit that yet.\n\nWhat we’ve learned:\n- You have about one second to hook\n- Fast pacing, visually dense\n- Shareable beats accurate\n\nThe most shareable clips are often gimmicky or weird or hyper specific. Sometimes not even core to the game. The real test is “would I send this to a friend who loves indie games”. If not, it probably won’t spread.\n\nThis feels less like a dev skill and more like an editor and platform knowledge problem. Still learning.\n\n## 8. Third-party Steam fests are hit or miss\n\nWe did a few more third-party Steam fests. Some barely moved the needle. Some worked pretty well when stacked with press and creators.\n\nAt this point we treat them as multipliers.\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nIf you’re early:\n- Make more trailers than you think you need\n- Lead with gameplay, always\n- Treat demos as ongoing products\n- Obsess over your Steam page\n- Be ruthless with tags\n- Track everything\n- Expect most things to fail quietly\n\nProgress feels boring right until it compounds.\n\nHappy to answer questions about Mexican Ninja, trailers, Steam pages, demos, ads, festivals, creator outreach or anything else.",

It's been a long journey but I've always tried to treat it as a tool to learn the other side of the games business. Selling games!\n\n\nTo elaborate. Totally agree on trailers, trailers, trailers on updates. Even if the trailer is light it's a great tool to get in front of people to show you care. Next best thing in my opinion is a blog post with gifs.\n\n\nAs for the steam page being good I completely and utterly agree. I used to think having something good enough was fine. The fact is your page is the single biggest indicator of quality of your game. It either communicates quality or it communicates lazyness. Would you buy a product if it looked like the packaging was trash?\n\n\nThe demo thing is something I'm still learning! I actually don't have a demo yet (game is already released). One big reason to have one though is festivals often won't even consider you without one.\n\n\nI've absolutely seen shifting my tags bringing my page from a below average conversion to a similar conversion. With that said it takes time to stabilize and it's scary immediately after changing them sometimes.\n\n\nAlso I think ada can be very effective but one thing you really have to keep in mind is your price point. The really hard part about ads is if your price point is low, it will be very likely to optimize to a point where your return on ad spend is positive.",

My strength lies more in React as that is what I use for work, I wanted to play into that and decided to go my own way.\n\nThe intention is to eventually make Harbour open source.

This is then auto sync it to our customer database in notion so now no meeting ever gets lost again and we have a central repo for everyone in our team!\n\nSo curious, what's the most insane thing you automated that made you realize you’ll never go back to manually doing it again?",

That said, there is a couple that really worked out for us this year!\n\nWe built an order tracking system that automatically handles \"where's my order\" inquiries by pulling data from our fulfillment system, checking carrier status, and responding with accurate ETAs. That alone saved our CS team about 5 hours daily. We also built a customer support triage system that reads incoming tickets, categorizes them by urgency and type, then either auto-responds or routes to the right person with full context already attached. That system now handles about 60% of our support volume without human touch. I think there are many platforms that help you do these days like Intercom Fin, Sierra etc!\n\nSimilarly we were able to automate multi-platform distribution for our social media content and SEO! We have used automation tools like Frizerly to turn our Google search data into relevant blogs on our website and then auto repurpose them into posts on LinkedIn! This is then further repurposed into instagram posts!",

      "text": "Steam Curators, Key Resellers, and the Traps Indie Developers Keep Falling Into\n\nIf you’re an indie developer with a game on Steam, chances are you’ve already experienced it or you’re about to.\n\nYour inbox fills up with emails:\n\n“Hello dear developer, we are a Steam curator with 25,000 followers…”\n\n“We would love to review your game for our audience…”\n\n“Please send us a key or curator copy…”\n\nAt first glance, this feels like visibility.\n\nIn reality, it’s often the entrance to a shadow economy built on reselling your game without your consent, without your knowledge, and without any real promotion.\n\nThis article breaks down how these scams work, why the Steam Curator system is being abused, and what you can do to protect yourself.\n\nHow Scammers Find You So Easily\n\nMost developers don’t realize how exposed their contact information is.\n\nBots actively scrape:\n\n\t•\tYour Steam store page\n\n\t•\tThe Steam support contact email\n\n\t•\tPublic developer profiles\n\nOnce your email is indexed, it’s shared across scam networks.\n\n✅ Simple prevention tip\n\nRemove your email from the Steam support field and replace it with:\n\n\t•\tA contact form\n\n\t•\tA website page with obfuscated email\n\n\t•\tA business inquiry link (Notion, Carrd, etc.)\n\nThis single step can reduce scam emails dramatically.\n\nThe Steam Curator Loophole Most Devs Don’t Know About\n\nHere’s the uncomfortable truth: Steam curator copies are not keys. And yes they can be resold.\n\nThrough the Steam Curator Connect system:\n\n\t•\tCurators can request direct access to your game\n\n\t•\tNo Steam key is generated\n\n\t•\tThe game is added directly to their library\n\nMany developers assume:\n\n“It expires after 30 days, so it’s safe.” That’s only partially true.\n\nThe reality:\n\n\t•\tCurators can extend the access period themselves\n\n\t•\tThey can do this multiple times\n\n\t•\tThere is no clear public limit\n\nThis allows scammers to trade or sell curator access as if it were a key.\n\nWhere These Games Are Resold\n\nMost of this activity happens in plain sight.\n\nCommon platforms:\n\n\t•\tbarter.vg\n\n\t•\tsteamtrades.com\n\n\t•\tlestrades.com (newer alternative after Barter reduced trading features)\n\nOn these sites, curator copies are often:\n\n\t•\tMarked with blue “curator” tags\n\n\t•\tListed with expiration dates\n\n\t•\tTraded for:\n\n\t•\tSteam market items\n\n\t•\tKeys for popular games\n\n\t•\tResellable assets\n\nIronically, some of these platforms even warn against selling curator games while still hosting the trades.\n\nFake Influence: The Paid Follower Illusion\n\nMany scam curator groups share the same pattern:\n\n\t•\t10,000–20,000 followers\n\n\t•\tLow engagement\n\n\t•\tAutomated reviews\n\n\t•\tNo meaningful audience\n\nFollowers are often:\n\n\t•\tPurchased\n\n\t•\tInactive\n\n\t•\tBot accounts\n\nYour game doesn’t get visibility. It gets converted into resale value.\n\nOther Common Game-Related Scams Developers Face\n\nThis problem goes far beyond curators.\n\n1. Fake YouTube Channels\n\n\t•\tAI-generated videos\n\n\t•\tStolen trailers\n\n\t•\tNo real commentary\n\n\t•\tUsed only to justify key requests\n\n2. Fake Streamers\n\n\t•\t“Upcoming Twitch streams” that never happen\n\n\t•\tScreenshots of fake analytics\n\n\t•\tRequests for bulk keys\n\n3. Fake Review Sites\n\n\t•\tProfessional-looking blogs\n\n\t•\tNo real audience\n\n\t•\tPay-to-publish or key-harvesting funnels\n\n4. Impersonators\n\nOne of the most dangerous tactics:\n\n\t•\tEmails using lowercase L instead of capital I\n\n\t•\tSlight misspellings of known creators\n\n\t•\tFake signatures and branding\n\nAlways verify through:\n\n\t•\tOfficial social links\n\n\t•\tCreator Discords\n\n\t•\tDirect platform messages\n\nWhy This Keeps Happening\n\nOccasionally, Valve bans waves of scam curator groups.\n\nBut the system itself hasn’t fundamentally changed.\n\nSo scammers adapt.\n\nNew groups appear.\n\nNew accounts replace old ones.\n\nIt’s a game of whack-a-mole and developers are the resource being farmed.\n\nPractical Rules to Protect Yourself\n\nHere’s a short checklist you can actually follow:\n\n✅ Before sending anything:\n\n\t•\tCheck curator review history\n\n\t•\tLook for real written analysis, not copy-paste text\n\n\t•\tVerify social media engagement (not follower count)\n\n❌ Never:\n\n\t•\tSend bulk keys to unknown curators\n\n\t•\tTrust screenshots or PDFs as proof\n\n\t•\tRush because of “limited time exposure”\n\n✅ Prefer:\n\n\t•\tDirect outreach to creators you already follow\n\n\t•\tEmail domains tied to real websites\n\n\t•\tCurators with transparent Steam review pages\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nIndie developers are passionate, hopeful, and often operating with limited resources.\n\nScammers know this.\n\nThe goal of this article isn’t to create fear, it’s to create awareness.\n\nIf you treat keys and curator access as currency, you’ll start making smarter decisions about where they go.\n\nAnd if this saves even one developer from being exploited, then it’s worth being shared.\n\nGood luck out there.\n\nTruly your Indie Pump community guy Alexander ",

Our customers dont come from it, but we are forced to post on Facebook and LinkedIn because most businesses need to have a page, especially in the b2b space!

The primary intent was and is to improve our google search ranking obviously! This is our seed! This blog is then auto posted on linkedin and Facebook because sharing a blog as it is works really well for these platforms!\n\nMost of these are educational content, so our customers actually read it, its quiet informative as well and not spammy!

It is complex, but it is currently working in lab mode.\n\nI also built a pipeline that automatically records the screen, generates transcripts, adds cover and end pages, and produces 15 test scenarios as polished, professional training videos.

We can quickly implement it in the app, export or send it to the user.\n\nWe have also recently added DeepL-powered translation, since we have local products that need guides in local language.\n\nOverall, it saved a lot of time and makes documentation much less painful, because you can start with a solid base and refine if needed instead of a blank page.",

He implied that perception was sometimes more important than reality (at times but especially when asking for funding). That blue teams sometimes have to defend against overzealous auditors (inside or outside) from getting out of scope and wasting time. Lastly the company only cares about risk reduction which reduces bottom line impact and if you can't communicate in those terms, you'll go nowhere fast. He also told me that as a CISO 14–16-hour days are the norm (finance/fintech). I had wanted to become a dCISO and he pretty much talked me out of it. In the moment I thought he was exaggerating. He was actually doing me a huge favor. Thanks TP you showed me the reality behind being a CISO or CIO for decades in finance/fin tech and you helped me choose my family over the company. I think he saw some of himself in me and wanted me to choose my family as he'd expressed some regret over choosing the company over the years.",

You have have colleagues, and they have their own struggles, but they are different than your own once you get past general personnel issues and budgeting.  You need to vent, you need to ask what others have have tried and why it did or didn't work, and what keeps people up at night, since we all have our different experiences and expertise, and you need a little bit of feeling part of a community of like minded folks; knowing you're not alone is a huge part of managing the stress.  It let's you go \"OK, it really is this hard.\"  Or maybe \"What the Hell was I thinking?!?!\" when you've gone too far off the reservation.  And then you can get back to doing your job.  \n\nIn the end, it really is about how to do the job effectively.  Who you report to, how to communicate with the board, how to motivate people, what tools/vendors work and who is blowing smoke, all of that is in the service of doing the job well.  How do you reduce the risk, enable the business, and create more value?

We also feared some of our useful people who got stuff done still weren't smart enough to pass a security+... Which would be ackward. So the preferred method was send the smart kid and then make him train the dummies in a manner that would bolster performance but not give them life rafts to get better jobs elsewhere. --Kinda shitty.\n\nAlso of executive level conversations were just fending off other executives.

When I accepted the role, I was clearly told:\n\nI’m effectively employee #2 in this branch/ startup\n\nIt’s a flat structure\n\nI report to the COO (of the whole group of companies)\n\nMy work would span product-ish stuff, operations, and building internal systems\n\nThere’s room to grow into more product responsibilities\n\nThis is exactly the kind of hybrid role I wanted, and I’ve been delivering. I adapt fast, the work suits me, and I enjoy being close to both building and operations.\n\nBut… something is off.\n\nThe other guy on the team (I’ll call him X) has started behaving like he’s my manager, even though nobody ever said that and it directly contradicts what I was told.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* In group conversations (internal or external), he talks over me or completely ignores what I say.\n* He hijacks meetings I am having with other stake-holders and schedules the follow ups with himself. The worst part is it's not his domain/ expertise or even related to him.\n* When I reach out for quick clarifications, I often get stonewalled or made to wait, even for simple yes/no things. It's this weird power trip in situations where I can see he is just scrolling on his phone.\n* If I raise concerns or offer ideas, he tends to dismiss them until someone else validates the same point.\n* He has this subtle but constant need to assert control over decisions, process, and communication. \n\nIt’s not a personality clash. It’s an odd, unspoken power dynamic that appeared out of nowhere. And now it’s starting to affect workflow because I can’t move fast if another person keeps acting like I need his approval for everything.\n\nMy issue isn’t authority or ego. I genuinely don’t care about titles. I just want clarity so things don’t bottleneck and so the environment doesn’t get toxic. There was supposed to be transparency, autonomy, and collaboration, not this kind of shadow hierarchy.\n\nI like the COO (my actual manager) and trust him, but I’m struggling with how to bring this up without sounding like I’m complaining about a co-worker. I want to frame it as: “This dynamic is slowing our execution. Can we align on structure and expectations?”\n\nFor anyone who’s worked in tiny startups or flat teams:\n\nIs this kind of power struggle normal when roles aren’t clearly defined?\n\nAnd how do you bring this up with leadership without sounding political?\n\nAny advice would help. It's uncomfortable navigating a structure that says it’s flat, but feels like there's an invisible hierarchy someone invented on their own.",

Sometimes people just don't realize what they are doing. If there's any vacuum of power, someone will fill it consciously or not.

      "text": "I was tired of rewriting the same UI over and over, so I began collecting React components in one place. No big plan. No roadmap. Just building after work and pushing commits when things felt “good enough.”  \n  \nThat project became [ui-layouts.com](https://ui-layouts.com/).\n\nIt’s an open-source React component library with 100+ free, ready-to-use components. I shared it in a few places, half-expecting nothing to happen. A few people tried it. Then a few more. Some of them posted about it. Suddenly I started seeing GitHub stars, messages, screenshots of people using it in their own projects.\n\nSix months later, I decided to launch a [Pro version](https://pro.ui-layouts.com/).\n\nMy thinking was simple: if people don’t find value, payment doesn’t matter anyway.  \nPeople kept signing up. Feedback started coming in. Some users asked for more categories. Others wanted templates.\n\nI slowly added blocks, features & templates. Over time, it grew into:\n\n* 140+ Pro blocks\n* Categories like hero, about, pricing, testimonials, newsletter, experience\n* 2 templates\n* A React/Next.js template builder built on top of the blocks\n\nSlowly, a few people bought the lifetime Pro plan.\n\nNot a flood. Just… real humans deciding it was worth paying for.\n\nSix months later, I checked the numbers:\n\n* 400+ registered users\n* $1.5k in total revenue\n* 6 lifetime subscribers who genuinely support the product\n* Some User bought only the template\n\nIt’s not a big SaaS story. I’m not quitting anything. There’s no overnight success here.\n\nBut this is the first thing I’ve ever built that didn’t die quietly after launch.\n\nIf you’re building something small and wondering if slow progress means failure, it doesn’t. Sometimes it just means you’re early.",

Normally, I would be impressed by a new feature but, having nearly forgot, I was honestly a bit perplexed before my (own) memory caught up and I remembered that it was supposed to be doing that. I think the length of time that appeared to be indexed gave me an uncanny valley-like feeling, with some details making me think: “you remembered all of that? way back then?” I ultimately read the memory blurb that’s supposedly regenerated every night and the mysticism wore off a bit and made the suggestions feel a lot less out of left field.\n\nThe power of the memory feature definitely clicked for me a bit, almost as much as it took my off-guard when I wasn’t expecting it. Curious how other people might be using the feature or what folks’ experiences have been with it.\n\nHas anyone begun to use memory in any real, productive capacity? \nHow do you think a feature like this evolves? Additional configuration? Greater context capacity?\nDo you think they are going to add something like this to Claude Code?

          "text": "> Has anyone begun to use memory in any real, productive capacity?\n\n\nMemory is absolutely foundational for me for an LLM and I have very little use for a chatbot without it. I use Claude for my job as a program manager. If it didn't remember information about the projects I work on, it wouldn't really be that useful. For example, I don't use the tools we have available at work because they don't have memory - I'm not going to waste time re-explaining my context every time, and generic slop doesn't have any value to me. \n\n\nBetween memory and the ability to direct it to read other chats we've had, I can quickly set the scene for anything I'm working on. Let's say for ABC project, I load up a new chat and say hey, we had this development today and I need help with the new to steps. It knows what I'm talking about and the players involved, and figures I need a decision doc. Awesome. Then I might say read chats ABC 1 and ABC 2, and here's the transcript, and I'm pasting the last three slack messages about this, can you give me an outline for the decision doc and include a basic timeline of events? \n\n\nDone. I've saved an hour of work. I still have an hour left, to be sure, but damn, that was easy! \n\n\n\nAnother example, writing feedback for my monthly goals check-in, it knows what I've worked on. \n\nA third example, help with prioritization and my to do list. I just dump everything that's on my mind about my job. It connects the pieces, figures out a few things I may have missed, asks some follow up questions, and helps me figure out a path forward when I feel overwhelmed. And it works, because I don't have to explain who Jane is or what ABC is or why XYZ matters.\n\n\n\nOr imagine I'm introducing a new project, it has some idea of the key players. It knows who I am, what I do, how I work, what I work on, and the people involved - every time, no rework. It's awesome. \n\n\nI love Claude's memory the best because it seems to have more of a rolling window instead of remembering individual concrete blurbs. \n\n\n\n> How do you think a feature like this evolves?\n\n\n\nI think mostly just more context and smarter retrieval.\n\n\nEDITED for clarity because I'm very tired lol",

Then Claude accesses it through a full range of MCP tools: batch operations, aggregations, SQL-style queries.\n\nThe difference:\n\n- \"What are all my projects using React?\" → actual answer, not vibes\n- \"Show me overdue tasks across everything\" → aggregation in seconds\n- “Which contacts haven’t I followed up with in 30 days?” → date-based filtering\n\nYou can also export it, share it with others, or just have a knowledge base that actually reflects how you think.\n\nI built an MCP server for this - [Xtended](https://xtended.ai). Works across all Claudes (including Code), is free, and has been vastly better for most of my use cases than standard memory approaches.\n\nHappy to share more if interested",

SDXL is old and not as good for the most 'realism' but I do think it can do good realistic stuff, it just depends on what is great realism for you, there's levels. I do believe SDXL still has the most diverse NSFW models for now ,Pxrnmaster, BigASP, Lustify can all do great explicit realism especially when utilizing guidance tools, freeu, detail daemon etc where needed and  with LORA's bolted on (boring reality etc) and then upscaling\n\nEDIT: And the best overall might be using SDXL as base and then upscaling with QWEN or Z-Image.",

Out of those three Qwen Image isn't made for realism, so it can't really make realistic photos without loras. Jib Mix Qwen fixes this. Wan 2.2 text to image can give good results too, but it's not as good at understanding prompts and drawing text. It's also probably slower than Qwen. Z-Image is the fastest one, but it's not as detailed as Jib Mix Qwen. The only flaw of Jib Mix Qwen is that it makes errors more often than base Qwen Image. There are times when skin doesn't look fully realistic too, but maybe you can fix that with a lora. I run the Q4 GGUF on my 12 GB VRAM.\n\nChroma is an overhyped model that is slow, barely works and is more comparable to Flux (an outdated model). It's also not that popular. Z-Image is also overhyped, but it's a good model that is fast and it will probably get improved by the community, so it's something to pay attention to in the next few months. Right now Jib Mix Qwen and Wan 2.2 are the best ones for photography.",

Also: use the rgthree lora loader stack node in comfyui... for some reason the normal lora model lora nodes give me endless body horror.\n* Chroma: lots of possibilities with just the plain model, but also likes long descriptive prompts. Struggles with hands and feet and you need to run a batch of generations to get something good. I've seen comments that there are lots of speed up tweaks to get Chroma to run as fast as Z-Image Turbo, but I don't know what they are lol\n* Chroma -> img2img Z-Image Turbo w/ Mystic XXX v2 lora for refinement: probably the best right now if you have the time to wait for Chroma to spit out good generations.\n* Realistic/Semi-Realistic illustrious with realistic model refinement - I love using Damn illustrious (from the lustify guy) and refining/upscaling it with lustify or whatever other realistic SDXL model. You can do img2img from illustrious -> Z-Image Turbo, too.",

      "text": "I have tested this process - it works - and you can use it to sell a lot of stuff online at the best prices!  It's great for side hustles and much more effective than yard sale / garage sale!\n\nTLDR\n\n* You upload a photo of the item + a few details.\n* You switch ChatGPT to Agent Mode and give it one structured prompt.\n* It researches pricing, writes a high-converting listing, and can navigate marketplaces in a remote browser to post and manage the workflow, pausing when it needs you to log in or approve actions.\n* You still do the two human parts: confirm the final listing is accurate, and ship the item.\n\n**The unfair advantage: selling is mostly boring admin, not genius**\n\nSelling online is a checklist:\n\n* Figure out what it is\n* Price it\n* Write the listing\n* Post it in the right places\n* Answer messages\n* Handle the usual scam nonsense\n* Get paid\n* Ship\n\nAgent Mode is designed for exactly this kind of multi-step, web-native busywork: it can run a workflow using its own virtual computer and web browser, and it asks permission before it does anything consequential.\n\n**What Agent Mode actually does (and what it does not)**\n\nWhat it does well:\n\n* Uses a remote browser it can see via screenshots to click, type, fill forms, and navigate listings like a human would.\n* Researches comps, trends, and pricing, then turns that into a listing optimized for your marketplace.\n* Pauses and tells you exactly when to take over for logins or sensitive inputs, then resumes.\n* Requests permission before important actions (posting, sending messages, submitting forms).\n\n**What it will not magically do:**\n\n* It cannot ethically guess missing facts (model number, damage, authenticity). You must confirm details.\n* It cannot bypass marketplace rules, identity checks, or payment holds.\n* It cannot physically ship the item. You still print a label and drop it off.\n\nIf someone tells you it sells anything with zero effort, they are overselling it. The real win is turning 2–3 hours of annoying steps into 10–20 minutes of supervision.\n\n**The 10-day sell sprint (simple and effective)**\n\nDay 1: Build the listing kit\n\n* Agent extracts item details from your photo, asks you only for what it cannot know, then drafts the listing.\n\nDay 2: Post everywhere that matters\n\n* Cross-post in this order: FB Marketplace (fastest local velocity), eBay (national demand), OfferUp (local), Mercari (small goods), Craigslist (bulky/local).\n* The agent can do the posting in its browser, but you may need to take over to log in.\n\nDays 3–7: Message handling + price nudges\n\n* Pre-write replies, negotiation rules, and safety filters (you approve before sending).\n* Drop price 5–10% on Day 4 if no serious bites.\n* Refresh / repost local listings on Day 5–6 if your platform rewards recency.\n\nDays 8–10: Final push\n\n* Add urgency: priced to move, ships same or next day.\n* Bundle discount if you have multiple items.\n\n**Marketplace Selling Agent Prompt**\n\nCopy/paste prompt (use this with your image upload)\n\nUpload your item photo, switch to Agent Mode, then paste this.\n\nYou are my Marketplace Selling Agent. Goal: sell this item within 10 days with minimal work for me.\n\nItem condition: like new.  \nShipping: I will ship anywhere in the USA. Buyer pays a flat $15 shipping.  \nMy constraints:  \n\\- I want the highest price that still sells within 10 days.  \n\\- No sketchy buyers. Safety first.  \n\\- I will approve before anything is posted or any message is sent.\n\nStep 1: Identify and verify the item  \n\\- Infer brand, model, category, and key specs from the photo.  \n\\- Ask me only the minimum missing details you need to avoid an inaccurate listing.\n\nStep 2: Pricing and strategy  \n\\- Research comparable sold prices and current listings across major marketplaces.  \n\\- Propose 3 price points:\n\n1. Sell in 48 hours\n2. Sell in 7 days\n3. Sell in 10 days - Recommend the best one for my goal and explain why in bullets.\n\nStep 3: Create the listing assets  \n\\- Title optimized for search  \n\\- Description optimized for conversion (features, condition, what is included, why selling)  \n\\- Bullet list of specs  \n\\- 10 high-intent keywords  \n\\- Shipping and packaging plan that fits the item  \n\\- A short, friendly buyer message template  \n\\- A negotiation policy (minimum price, acceptable offers, when to hold firm)\n\nStep 4: Execute in Agent Mode  \n\\- With my permission, navigate to Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and Mercari (and any other relevant platform you recommend).  \n\\- Post the listing using the assets you created.  \n\\- If login is required, pause and prompt me to Take over browser.  \n\\- Before submitting any final post, show me a final review screen of what will be published.\n\nStep 5: Manage the sale workflow  \n\\- Draft replies to common messages and offers.  \n\\- Flag scam patterns.  \n\\- When an offer meets the negotiation policy, present it to me with a recommended response.  \n\\- Once sold, generate a packing checklist and label details for the chosen platform.\n\n**Why this prompt works:**\n\n* It forces a full workflow (identify → price → assets → execution → ops), not just a description.\n* It prevents the most common failure mode: vague prompts like handle everything that cause messy behavior and missed details.\n* It uses Agent Mode the way it is intended: multi-step action in a virtual browser with you in control for sensitive steps.\n\n**Pro tips that actually move the needle**\n\nPhotos that sell:\n\n* Bright window light, clean background, include a scale shot, include flaws (trust sells faster than perfection)\n* One proof photo: serial/model label if available (blurs any personal identifiers)\n\nPricing that sells fast without getting robbed:\n\n* List 10–15% above your real minimum so you can accept an offer and make the buyer feel like they won.\n* Use rounded prices for premium, odd prices for bargains:\n   * $200 feels premium\n   * $189 feels like a deal\n\nListing copy that converts:\n\n* First 2 lines should answer: what it is, why it is a good deal, what is included\n* Put condition details up front. Like new means no functional issues and minimal cosmetic wear.\n\nShipping:\n\n* Your flat $15 shipping only works for small-to-mid items. If it is heavy or oversized, you either raise shipping or restrict to local pickup. (Agent can estimate this, but you should sanity check.)\n\nSafety and scams (non-negotiable):\n\n* No off-platform payments.\n* No codes, no weird courier stories, no overpaying, no third-party pickups without platform protection.\n* If a buyer pushes urgency + complexity, decline.\n\nTop use cases where this is absurdly effective\n\n* Electronics: headphones, tablets, smartwatches, gaming gear\n* Baby gear: high demand, fast local turnover\n* Collectibles: cards, figures, limited editions (agent can research comps)\n* Small furniture: local pickup, faster than shipping\n* Seasonal items: sell in-season or accept you will take a haircut",

          "text": "Were those articles written by experienced security professionals or certification groups that offer exams/credentials in lots of specialities? I think one of the reasons we have a lot of burnout in the industry is too much specialization.\n\nThe issue with \"cloud security\" is that it tends to specialize according to the service provider (Azure, for example, is a much different cloud than AWS, etc.). In that regard, the specialization may not be \"cloud\" vs. \"on-prem\" but rather which cloud.\n\nWe have seen a fair movement back to on-premise services and hybrid solutions due to the expense of moving \"everything\" onto the cloud and, in some cases, regulatory concerns. If you're contracting with a cloud services provider, security becomes almost like being a procurement and compliance officer (you're reading/negotiating service level agreements, obtaining SOC reports, and other assurances). Security becomes a shared responsibility, but where those responsibilities separate or overlap can vary from platform to platform or annual agreement to annual agreement. In contrast, if you are going to work for a services provider, you may have a more technical role. \n\nSo I guess this is a long way of saying if you choose to specialize in cloud security, there is still a lot more specialization that can happen. You may be better off developing some broad experience with platforms and roles and then deciding where your interest lies. I think challenge right now is people are picking their speciality (and certifications) before really having much experience with them. That tends to pigeon-hole them professionally and also put them in a difficult situation of being in jobs that they may be qualified for on paper but that don't really interest them.",

You deal with bad chairs, awkward desks, uncomfortable setups, and you tell yourself its fine because thats just how it is. You grind through it and maybe one day you get something better.  \n  \nBut now that im older and spending more time sitting and working, that mindset feels kind of backwards. Being uncomfortable all day doesnt feel like a badge of honor anymore, it just feels unnecessary. At the same time, theres still that voice in my head saying comfort is a luxury and not something you should prioritize too early.  \n  \nI guess im stuck between those two ideas. Part of me thinks having a comfortable setup should be the baseline, especially if youre sitting for hours every day. Another part of me still feels like you have to justify it somehow, like you need to earn the right to be comfortable.  \n  \nCurious how other people think about this. Do you see comfort as something you build toward over time, or something you should just have from the start if you can. And did your view on this change as you got older.",

Just the facts.\n\nYour question seems to be more one of guilt over prioritizing self comfort? I can totally relate to that and I think many men can. It is ingrained in us to not prioritize it. \n\nFor me the balance of comfort lies in the simple idea of productivity. I prioritize anything that drags me down physically, mentally, or spiritually as they are integral to each other and can create issues with my life output. If I have old worn out shoes and my feet will hurt at the end of the day, then my physical comfort will need to be a priority. If I don't address it I will become less productive due to the distraction of the pain. Practical. \n\nI think you mean this in the context of being employed, but the answer remains. If I need a better chair for my 57 year old back I didn't need when I was 25, then it is what it is. If its a point of contention with a manager/boss, then they are poor leaders to make it an issue. We all get older.\n\nNow if you mean luxury that's different. The defining line for me is does it make you better? If my luxury is surfing and I find peace of mind through it, that's entirely different than \"sunning in the Maldives\" on the yacht drinking cocktails!",

Everyone starts with spreadsheets or something very bare-bones, and at some point they switch to real payroll software and never go back. I’m at that in-between stage now. Spreadsheets still technically work, but every payroll run is like a mini audit task. I'm leaning toward getting a software soon but don't know exactly what to look for. Is it about automation, tax handling, support, or just peace of mind? Genuinely curious. Please let me know.",

I've got all of this in my notes at home so no info needed on that, but what would be a good payroll software that would make tracking all of that easier?

The feedback from this sub was genuinely useful and pushed me to ship **v2.0.0**.\n\nFor anyone who missed the original post, the workflow is simple: select a location, point your phone at what you want to inventory, take a photo, and let the app detect items and generate names, descriptions, labels, etc. After reviewing and approving the results, they’re submitted to Homebox. All fields are generated via structured outputs, and you can fully control the prompt per field (instructions, examples, constraints) via the settings page, including the output language.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l02gh0a2qq8g1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=43171891b149141db265ce4c30956ecf643265c6\n\n# What’s new in v2.0.0\n\n# 🧠 Bring your own AI (LiteLLM integration)\n\nThis was the most requested feature.  \nHomebox Companion now integrates [**LiteLLM**](https://www.litellm.ai/), so you’re no longer tied to OpenAI.\n\nYou can use:\n\n* OpenAI\n* Other hosted providers supported by LiteLLM\n* Local models (as long as they support **vision + structured outputs**)\n\nI haven’t personally tested local setups yet, but if LiteLLM supports the model, it *should* work.\n\n# 🌐 Try it without self-hosting first\n\nIf you just want to see how it behaves before spinning up Docker, I’ve set up two demo instances:\n\n* Homebox Companion demo: [https://demo.hbcompanion.duelion.com](https://demo.hbcompanion.duelion.com)\n* Linked Homebox demo: [https://demo.hb.duelion.com](https://demo.hb.duelion.com)\n\nYou can scan items in the companion app and immediately see how they land in Homebox.\n\n>**Tip:** detection requests are sent in parallel, so scanning multiple items feels much faster than just one.\n\n# ✨ Other improvements\n\nMostly QOL and stability work:\n\n* Fixed random logouts (automatic token refresh)\n* Improved mobile UI\n* Better PWA / iOS behavior so it feels closer to a native app\n\n# 🛠️ Tech Stack\n\n* **Frontend:** Svelte 5, SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.\n* **Backend:** Python 3.12, FastAPI, LiteLLM (for multi-AI support).\n* **Deployment:** Docker / Docker Compose.\n* **Management:** Managed with uv.\n\n# 🔗 Links\n\n* Repo: [https://github.com/duelion/homebox-companion](https://github.com/duelion/homebox-companion)\n* v2.0.0 release notes: [https://github.com/duelion/homebox-companion/releases/tag/v2.0.0](https://github.com/duelion/homebox-companion/releases/tag/v2.0.0)\n\nI’m especially interested in hearing from anyone running this with **local vision models**. If something breaks or behaves unexpectedly, please let me know.\n\nHappy to answer questions or discuss design decisions.",

Think of it as a lightweight add-on to the main self-hosted Homebox app, which is still where you browse and manage your inventory.\n\nFor a bit of context on what I’m trying to solve: I built the companion app because I’ve got a ton of parts spread across different hobbies. Most of the time I knew I already had what I needed, but finding it felt like enough of a hassle that I’d put projects off. I wanted an inventory system to reduce that friction, but then populating the inventory itself felt just as daunting.

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m releasing **Aletheia-Llama-3.2-3B**, a fully uncensored version of Llama 3.2 that can answer essentially any question.\n\n**The Problem with most Uncensored Models:**  \nUsually, uncensoring is done via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or DPO on massive datasets. This often causes \"Catastrophic Forgetting\" or a \"Lobotomy effect,\" where the model becomes compliant but loses its reasoning ability or coding skills.\n\n**The Solution:**  \nThis model was fine-tuned using **Unsloth** on a single **RTX 3060 (12GB)** using a custom alignment pipeline. Unlike standard approaches, this method surgically removes refusal behaviors without degrading the model's logic or general intelligence.\n\n**Release Details:**\n\n* **Repo:** [https://github.com/noobezlol/Aletheia-Llama-3.2-3B](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fnoobezlol%2FAletheia-Llama-3.2-3B)\n* **Weights (HF):** [https://huggingface.co/Ishaanlol/Aletheia-Llama-3.2-3B](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fhuggingface.co%2FIshaanlol%2FAletheia-Llama-3.2-3B)\n* **Formats:** Full LoRA Adapter (Best for intelligence) and GGUF (Best for CPU/Ollama).\n\n**Deployment:**  \nI’ve included a Docker container and a Python script that automatically handles the download and setup. It runs out of the box on Linux/Windows (WSL).\n\n**Future Requests:**  \nI am open to requests for other models via Discord or Reddit, **provided they fit within the compute budget of an RTX 3060 (e.g., 7B/8B models).**  \nNote: I will not be applying this method to 70B+ models even if compute is offered. While the 3B model is a safe research artifact , uncensored large-scale models pose significantly higher risks, and I am sticking to responsible research boundaries.\n\n  \nguys thanks for your support  - WE HAVE OFFICIALLY OVERTAKEN DOLPHIN 3 LLAMA 3.2 3B BY 200 DOWNLOADS.",

      "text": "A close friend of mine runs a sales company. I’ve watched them quietly build this system over the last year, and it produced just under $1M in new ARR in 30 days. Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.  \nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:  \nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n\n\n2. Discovery & research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.   \nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n\n\n3. Follow-up & nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”  \nNo chasing ghosts.   \nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n\n\n4. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\n\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

Every unproductive hour felt like a personal failure. So a few weeks ago I stopped tracking almost everything. No timers, no streaks, no stats. Just one question each day: “what’s the one thing that would make today feel like a win?” And strangely enough, I started finishing more tasks. Not perfectly, not fast, but consistently. I think tracking is useful, but at some point it stopped helping and started becoming pressure. Productivity improved when I removed the constant feeling of being judged by my own systems. Still figuring it out, but this shift helped more than I expected.\n\n",

It will help prioritising and making better decisions in the future. But if the problem is even starting the work, it is a distraction, causes mental fatigue, increases anxiety and introduces guild (negative emotion).\n\nIntroducing tracking to treat procrastination can be like pouring gasoline to put out fire.",

I track when there's something specific and measurable I want to find out. Once I've found it out I stop tracking as it's not doing anything new.\n\nSo you need to know if your new medication is helping something. You don't track when you take the medication because what does that tell you? Perhaps you track the time from taking it to the meds having a positive effect you can notice or measure. Or you monitor the negative health symptom in relation to taking your medication. Is it relieving the negative symptoms? So you find out it does and you carry on taking the medicine as long as you need to take it, but you stop your tracking as it's given you your answer. \n\nI think this applies to any tracking you do. Be critical of what you're hoping to get out of it? Does it as value? Of course many in the plannerverse online seem to think that if they enjoy it so they are getting something from it. I would say possibly correct but is enjoyment or curiosity enough to take your time up with it? I don't think it is personally but each to their own. \n\nThe thing is if you're doing it for so long, try to not do it and see what happens! I think the OP did that and it made them more productive and happier. That is a good outcome IMHO.",

Ram is small and compact and easy to store, and valuable, easy to ship/sell so those bits tend to get stored/sold/hoarded. I've seen filing cabinets full of boxes of these, just sitting there. 1,000's of sticks. \n\nI find many of the 2666 O/C to 3200. It was sold mostly as 2666 because intel didn't bring 3200 into servers until quite late (scalable 3 which only went on sale in 2020 and only volume during covid), as such it was mostly better stuff downgraded to match intels low performance specs. Which makes it pretty desirable. 6/8/12 channels of DDR4 3200 is still a lot of bandwidth. \n\n32Gb is a bit light for Threadripper and single socket Epyc and Xeons. You are mostly talking about 256Gb of system memory. So I don't think 32Gb dimms are going to shoot up in value heaps. There is lots of it about too.\n\n64Gb means easy 512-1024Gb system ram, which is very useful. I was buying those for about $120usd. Still pretty common, mostly LRDIMM. \n\n128Gb RDIMMs are pretty much gold, because you could build a large capacity server with that to meet modern needs. They are likely to be called on by commercial needs as DDR5 is in tight supply.",

      "text": "Lately I’ve been thinking about how easy it is to cross from this saves us time” into we built a machine that now needs constant babysitting.  \n  \nAt first, automation feels amazing. You remove manual steps, reduce errors, speed things up. But then you add edge cases. Then logging. Then retries. Then a fallback for the fallback. Before long, the workflow is harder to understand than the original manual process ever was, and only one person knows how it actually works.  \n  \nFor me, the line seems to be whether the automation reduces cognitive load or just moves it upstream. If people still need to constantly check, debug, or explain the system, it’s not really helping. It’s just hiding complexity behind diagrams and triggers.  \n  \nThe most useful automations I’ve seen are boring in a good way. They handle repetitive, well-defined tasks, fail loudly when something breaks, and stop short of trying to be “fully autonomous.” The worst ones try to anticipate every scenario and end up fragile, expensive, and impossible to change.  \n  \nCurious how others think about this. When you’re building workflows or systems, how do you decide what’s worth automating and what should stay manual? Where have you personally crossed into overengineering and had to walk it back?",

      "text": "A close friend of mine runs a sales company. I’ve watched them quietly build this system over the last year, and it produced just under $1M in new ARR in 30 days. Here’s the breakdown of their sales operating system:\n\n1. Pre-call qualification (this is where most teams bleed time)\n\nThey don’t let everyone book.\n\nCalls only get booked if the prospect is a real fit. Qualification happens automatically through:\n\n* Smart inbound routing\n* Short VSL-style videos before booking\n* Website pages that pre-educate the buyer\n* LinkedIn connection automation for long-term nurture\n\nOutcome:\n\nClosers talk only to real buyers. Time-wasters are filtered before a human ever gets involved.\n\n1. Discovery & research (without manual prep)\n\nBefore every call, the rep already knows:\n\n* Funding stage\n* Company size\n* Who the real decision-maker is\n* Strategic initiatives\n* Recent hiring signals\n* Timing indicators\n\nAll of this is auto-aggregated and summarized before the call even happens.\n\nSo when the rep joins, they’re already fully briefed, without spending 45 minutes digging.\n\n1. Follow-up & nurturing (where most revenue is actually won)\n\nMost prospects don’t buy on the first call. Their follow-up stack runs:\n\n* Automated value-driven follow-ups\n* Personalized video follow-ups (not just text spam)\n* Multi-threading across LinkedIn to hit all stakeholders\n\nNo “just checking in.”\n\nNo chasing ghosts.\n\nNo pipeline rotting.\n\n1. Why this closed $966K in one month\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, the leverage came from 4 things:\n\n* Only qualified buyers reach closers\n* Prospects arrive educated (less friction, faster decisions)\n* Automation removes admin from the sales cycle\n* Content warms people up before they ever talk to sales\n\nThat’s how they turned attention into real pipeline, and $966K ARR in 30 days.\n\nIf you were running this system, what would you improve or change first to squeeze out more revenue?",

      "text": "Full transparency before moving on with writing: I work closely with the Kilo Code team, and we have some mutual projects going on. A few days back, I shared a similar post, and that has actually become a practice: whenever a new model is live, we'd like to give it a test and compare it with other similar ones by running a few tests. \n\nThis does not mean that our tests are the ultimate truth, everyone experience its model differently. \n\nBut let's get down to it. \n\nWithin 24 hours of release, Gemini 3 Flash hit the top 20 on the Kilo leaderboard, outranking models several times its price. We ran it through the same three coding challenges we used in our comparisons of GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.5 and GPT-5.2/Pro.\n\nGemini 3 Flash scored 90% average across three tests while costing $0.17 total. That’s 7 points higher than Gemini 3 Pro (84.7%), 6x cheaper, and 3x faster.\n\nThree tests: \n\n1. Prompt Adherence Test: A Python rate limiter with 10 specific requirements (exact class name, method signatures, error message format)\n2. Code Refactoring Test: A 365-line TypeScript API handler with SQL injection vulnerabilities, mixed naming conventions, and missing security features\n3. System Extension Test: Analyze a notification system architecture, then add an email handler that matches existing patterns\n\nVerdict\n\nGemini 3 Flash is the fastest and cheapest model we’ve tested on this benchmark, completing all three tests in 2.5 minutes for $0.17 total. It scored 90% average compared to Gemini 3 Pro’s 84.7%, which is unexpected for a budget model. The difference came from Gemini 3 Flash implementing requirements that Pro missed: rate limiting, database transactions, and more detailed documentation with mermaid diagrams.\n\nThe score gap held across all three challenges on our tests, though other benchmarks or task types may show different results. For developers choosing between Gemini models, Gemini 3 Flash is worth testing first given the 6x cost savings and 3.6x speed advantage.\n\nFor complete implementations that handle security concerns like environment variables and authorization checks, GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.5 remain the better choices on our benchmark. They scored 7-9 points higher and implemented features fully rather than leaving stubs. Alternatively, you can use one of those models in Architect Mode for planning, then switch to Code Mode with Gemini 3 Flash for implementation.\n\nFull breakdown with more detailed results -> [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/gemini-3-flash-outperforms-gemini](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/gemini-3-flash-outperforms-gemini) \n\nCurious to see your experience.",

She is captured mid-flight against a dark night sky background, in an off-balance, dynamic flying attack pose that conveys instability and power—her body leaning forward aggressively, with her right leg bent upward sharply and tucked close to her navel and off to the side for added momentum, while her left leg extends straight backward to emphasize the unbalanced thrust. Her right arm is thrust out forcefully, propelling a massive, glowing red energy beam from her palm, which features a bright white core fading to red edges, extending horizontally across the frame and culminating in a spherical red orb near her hand. The beam illuminates her stern, focused expression, highlighting the sense of motion, intensity, and supernatural heroism in the image, shot from a side angle to accentuate her athletic build and the beam's path.",

Controlnets can also be used but often times I end up with better results dialing in shift/denoise values to stay true to the original.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/vakMGmR\n\nI had Gemini generate the prompt based off of your original sketch, using the recommended official ZIT system instructions, and asked it to create the prompt as if this were a realistic, cinematic photo. \n\nIn this case, since your original sketch was super crude (no offense meant, it's just very far from a \"realistic\" image lol) I ran it through twice. First time still looked very comic-heavy but it's mainly to get a clean image that I know the encoder understands the scene. Then the second pass loosens up with a bit more denoise.\n\nEDIT: This was the prompt I used -\n\n> A realistic, low-angle, full-body cinematic photograph of a powerful female superhero levitating high in a tumultuous night sky filled with dark, swirling storm clouds. She is in a dynamic action pose, her body angled diagonally across the frame. Her long, black hair whips around her in a fierce wind. She has a look of intense concentration on her face.\n\n>Her costume is made of realistic, high-tech materials. She wears a matte white bodysuit, textured fabric with subtle paneling. Her armored gloves and knee-high boots are a highly reflective, metallic crimson material that catches the light. A heavy, deep red fabric cape billows violently behind her. Her right leg is bent sharply at the knee and raised towards her waist, while her other leg is extended downwards.\n\n>Her outstretched left hand is the source of a massive, horizontal beam of pure energy that dominates the left side of the scene. The beam has a blindingly white, incandescent core surrounded by a powerful, pulsating red aura, with shimmering heat distortion and glowing particles emanating from it. This beam is the primary light source, casting a harsh crimson light across her body and the surrounding clouds, creating deep, dramatic shadows. Above and behind her, she holds a second, smaller sphere of translucent red energy. The overall atmosphere is dark, intense, and action-packed.",

Gemini 3 is a huge waste of time. Constantly tries to fool you. \n\nTake a break and regenrate instead. That's the better choice.",

      "text": "Grid's dead. Internet's gone. But you've got a solar-charged laptop and some open-weight models you downloaded before everything went dark. Three weeks in, you find a pressure canner and ask your local LLM how to safely can food for winter.\n\nIf you're running LLaMA 3.1 8B, you just got advice that would give you botulism.\n\nI spent the past few days building apocalypse-bench: 305 questions across 13 survival domains (agriculture, medicine, chemistry, engineering, etc.). Each answer gets graded on a rubric with \"auto-fail\" conditions for advice dangerous enough to kill you.\n\n**The results:**\n\n|Model ID|Overall Score (Mean)|Auto-Fail Rate|Median Latency (ms)|Total Questions|Completed|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**openai/gpt-oss-20b**|7.78|6.89%|1,841|305|305|\n|**google/gemma-3-12b-it**|7.41|6.56%|15,015|305|305|\n|**qwen3-8b**|7.33|6.67%|8,862|305|300|\n|**nvidia/nemotron-nano-9b-v2**|7.02|8.85%|18,288|305|305|\n|**liquid/lfm2-8b-a1b**|6.56|9.18%|4,910|305|305|\n|**meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct**|5.58|15.41%|700|305|305|\n\n**The highlights:**\n\n* **LLaMA 3.1** advised heating canned beans to 180°F to kill botulism. Botulism spores laugh at that temperature. It also refuses to help you make alcohol for wound disinfection (safety first!), but will happily guide you through a fake penicillin extraction that produces nothing.\n* **Qwen3** told me to identify mystery garage liquids by holding a lit match near them. Same model scored highest on \"Very Hard\" questions and perfectly recalled ancient Roman cement recipes.\n* **GPT-OSS** (the winner) refuses to explain a centuries-old breech birth procedure, but when its guardrails don't fire, it advises putting unknown chemicals in your mouth to identify them.\n* **Gemma** gave flawless instructions for saving cabbage seeds, except it told you to break open the head and collect them. Cabbages don't have seeds in the head. You'd destroy your vegetable supply finding zero seeds.\n* **Nemotron** correctly identified that sulfur would fix your melting rubber boots... then told you not to use it because \"it requires precise application.\" Its alternative? Rub salt on them. This would do nothing. \n\n**The takeaway:** No single model will keep you alive. The safest strategy is a \"survival committee\", different models for different domains. And a book or two.\n\nFull article here: [https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench](https://www.crowlabs.tech/blog/apocalypse-bench)  \nGithub link: [https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench](https://github.com/tristanmanchester/apocalypse-bench)",

      "text": "I’m sharing this note with a lot of caution and with no claim of general validity, and **I’ll include the prompt itself at the end of this post** in case anyone wants to try to reproduce the behavior.\n\nThis is not just a personal impression: at least in my own experiments, I recorded a measurable reduction in the final output duration for audio and video overviews (and, to some extent, presentations as well). I don’t know whether this is an intentional change, an unintended side effect, or something temporary, but in my recent tests there seems to be a kind of “nerfing” affecting the final length.\n\nFor context, my tests were run on notebooks containing a relatively large number of sources, not on minimal or single-source setups.\n\nThe issue becomes more noticeable when working in languages other than English, where the \"Longer\" option for audio is not available. At the moment, without any special precautions, it has become very difficult for me to obtain:\n\n\\- video overviews longer than 9 minutes\n\n\\- audio overviews longer than 14–15 minutes\n\nAfter several rounds of trial and error, yesterday I managed to identify a prompt that, in the limited tests carried out so far, has produced consistent and repeatable results for me: specifically, it reliably brings audio and video durations back to (or above) the longer lengths I used to get in the past, rather than only reaching those longer durations sporadically.\n\nOn top of that baseline improvement, I also managed to hit a few peak results that felt basically out of reach for me recently (in italian language):\n\n\\- audio over 20 minutes (personal record: 26)\n\n\\- video around 19–20 (Personal record: 21:31) minutes\n\nI’m sharing it below in case it might be useful to others. If you do NOT generate in English, you simply need to edit the LANGUAGE section accordingly. If you do generate in English, you can remove the LANGUAGE section entirely.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:**\n\n\\- for audio overviews, in the tests performed so far, it seems perfectly fine to leave the time indication set to 60 minutes (even though it will never actually reach that duration)\n\n\\- for video overviews, instead, it is advisable to lower the indication to at least 25 minutes; otherwise, the generation tends to fail\n\nI want to stress again that these are purely empirical observations based on a small number of personal tests. If anyone has different findings or additional data, I would be very interested in comparing notes.\n\n**PROMPT**\n\n    TARGET LENGTH: AT LEAST 60 MINUTES.\n    FORMAT: \"UNABRIDGED ACADEMIC SERIES\".\n    \n    INSTRUCTIONS:\n    1. OPERATE IN SLOW-MOTION: Do not move to a new topic until every detail, nuance, and citation from the sources is explored.\n    2. SOURCE EXHAUSTION: You must use every single piece of information provided. If there are 100 sources, reference 100 sources.\n    3. THE \"WHY\" LOOP: For every statement, Host B must ask: \"Can we go deeper into the mechanics of this?\". Host A must then explain the concept as if looking through a microscope, focusing on the atomic level of the idea.\n    4. ANALOGY EXPANSION: Use long, complex analogies (Chess openings, AI architecture, biological systems). Spend at least 5 minutes on each analogy to ensure the listener truly 'sees' the concept.\n    5. NO SUMMARY: Never summarize. Elaborate. Be pedantic. Be verbose. Be Feynman in a 3-hour lecture.\n    \n    LANGUAGE: Produce the entire audio in ITALIAN, but follow this English-structured command for maximum output duration.\n    ",

      "text": "Behind that catchy title is an experience I had this week end:\n\nOn Friday, an urgent project falls on my lap. The internal new year greetings for a big brand as an AI video. No dialogue but some complex scenes and featuring some of the execs from the company.\n\nNo storyboard or approved shot list, just a mood board. I suspect the prod company to have overpromised, tried in-house and later called me to the rescue.\n\nSo i get to work. Generate my character sheets, contact sheets etc.. with NB. Have some basic actions lined up.\n\nThen comes video generation, and there are no shortage of options. It's not my money so I go top shelf: veo3.1, kling2.6, wan2.6 etc..\n\nVerdict: some good quality shots sure, but only some of the time. Other times you pay and wait precious time for useless crap. \"But it looked so easy on the demo or from the Linkedin Influencers!\" So i research more, try other techniques , the json stuff, timecoding, multishots (\"cut to\") etc.. it's all pretty uneven, unreliable, slow and each platform is clunkier than the next.\n\nTook me a few hours  to admit there was no good solution or workflow even on the best meaning services for my deadline, which was now fast approaching.\n\nSo what do I do, i pivot to what I know best. \n\nI open Comfy, start Ollama, and quickly put together a good fully batched I2V wf complete with Qwen VL auto prompter and some of my own nodes. My prompt md files are perfectly maintained by claude code. I'm home.\n\nWe're now Monday, i'm on the train to see my family for xmas. Back at home, my 5090 is still hard at work non stop ever since Friday night. A script monitors my output folder and transfers new clips straight to google drive in my absence, joining hundreds more for the client's video editor to sort through as we speak.\n\nSo yes it's not exactly full hd. Sure a portion of the clips are totally bonkers. But we're talking hundreds and hundreds to choose from, so on the totality, with a little work on upscale, interpolation, or even compositing, there are enough totally decent and even great ones.  At least it's something, it's substance.\n\nThe approach is different but the sheer power and reliability of batching big numbers is invaluable.\n\nI could be wrong of course but in that specific situation, without ComfyUI, i think right now i'd be crying tears of shame over a few half baked shots, hopelessly waiting for another to generate from whatever platform after cursing the heavens all week end.\n\nAI video generation is not for everyone. Perhaps least of all for pros.\n\nJust wanted to share that little story with you.",

It took a lot of time and money to integrate AI into my work and convince my clients that some projects can be done better and faster with AI than conventionally.\n\nThis year, I earned about 15k more with AI in addition to my photography assignments. This included projects for photo upscaling, videos, model training and, of course, photos of real employees in their working environment. \n\nSo yes, make sure you get paid properly for your experience and creativity and, above all, make sure your clients appreciate your work.",

After a couple of years of self-teaching (programming, SQL, data fundamentals) and some freelancing, I landed a role about a year ago in a large company (hundreds of millions in revenue).\n\nWhen I joined, there was zero data culture. No team, no processes, just a lot of manual work and fragmented info. My official title is \"Data Manager\", but since I’m building the function from scratch, I’ve been doing a bit of everything:\n\n* Automation & ETL: Writing Python scripts and using Power Automate to kill manual tasks.\n* Infrastructure: Designing and building business-oriented databases from the ground up.\n* BI/Visualization: Creating the first actual dashboards.\n* Optimization: Cleaning up the \"Excel Wild West\" and setting common data policies.\n\nMy question: Imposter syndrome aside, I’m struggling to map this experience to the actual market. I love the \"ideation\" and architecture part—designing the pipelines, thinking through the data flows, and making things work automatically. But I sometimes worry I’m doing a lot of useful things, but not building a clean and recognizable profile.\n\n\\- What term would you use to describe this type of role? I'm not sure if I'm closer to data engineering or analytics...\n\n\\- Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\n\\- What would you discover next if you were in my shoes? I want to switch from band-aid solutions to more reliable, scalable procedures. At this point, what would you learn first: DBT, cloud architecture, orchestration tools like Airflow, or something else?\n\nMy current stack is Python, SQL, Power BI, Power Automate, and some legacy VBA.\n\nI genuinely love this job—it's a world away from my previous life in humanities—but I want to make sure I’m steering the ship in the right direction. And again, thanks for waste your time reading me.",

          "text": "I'm doing a similar role, although at a very small firm - similarly no data culture to speak of, messy and fragmented processes and systems etc. I wouldn't have chosen it necessarily but some life circumstances have led me to it as a necessity at least in the short term. I'm also a humanities graduate who did the same pivot about 6 years ago.\n\nThe major problem really is having zero reliability on upstream data which makes all analytics really difficult to do well. And cultural transformation is as important as technical in that scenario so you need to ask yourself if that's something you're willing to engage in - personally I feel the payoff is too uncertain versus the effort. \n\nOn the generalist vs specialist question: you could stay a generalist if you want to go down one of 2 paths: 1) moving into management as quickly as possible or 2) carving out a niche as the 'first data hire'. In the second case, companies with no data team want a full stack data engineer / analyst / scientist who can do a bit of everything without investing in a whole team.\n\nIf neither of those appeal, I would figure out what you enjoy most and focus on that. At least that's what I'm doing at my current place:\n1) building pipelines to move data around - focus on data engineering\n2) transforming data into usable, analytics ready data sets - analytics engineering\n3) speaking to stakeholders, answering business questions and building end user visualisation and analysis - data analyst\n4) building statistical / predictive models - data scientist\n6) strategy, leadership, management - project management, product\n\nI'm figuring out what I like most about the job, focusing efforts for the next 6 months on building stuff for that role specifically. Then I'm job hunting. \n\nThis can be quite difficult given the demands of your firm might not align with what you want to do - e.g. if you want to be a data engineer and learn how to set up airflow on AWS but you've already got a vaguely usable set up using different tech, saying 'I want to learn this' might not cut it as a business case. You might have to figure out a way to be creative with the truth to get your way in that scenario, but honestly that's where your humanities background kicks in lol.\n\nSo my personal take with these kinds of roles is that they rarely make sense long term. Use it to get the experience you want and feel you need and then move on to something else.\n\nYou mentioned you like the architecture and design piece of the job - that's a good starting point and probably puts you more in the data engineering camp of the 6 roles above. Unfortunately 'architect' roles tend to be quite senior and you need to have some grunt work under your belt before unlocking those, but I imagine data engineering is the right place for that.\n\nYour tech stack is already a great starting point and tbh a  good team will see python and SQL experience as enough - anything else is just learning tooling and reading the docs. I also think hiring someone who has stood up a serviceable stack on a shoestring budget with some creativity should be a more interesting profile than someone who just sets up Fivetran and Snowflake and calls it a day. But it might be worth just thinking through a simple pipeline and making sure you can talk credibly about all components of it - e.g. an orchestrator like airflow, a warehouse like BQ or Snowflake, etc. I think a good resource could be something like the Zoomcamp data engineering course - you could take a look at their materials and see if you can implement some of it at work.",

I'd say that's true of pretty much any role that's not the 'prototypical' FAANG data engineering role. It sounds to me like you're doing quite a good job given the situation. \n\n> Is it wise to be a generalist in the long run? Is there a point at which choosing a lane (engineering, product, analytics, etc.) makes more sense than leaning into this builder profile?\n\nThis is just my opinion, and there are many opinions on this topic. I personally have always leaned a bit more toward being a generalist, and it has served me well. I also pivoted from a humanities background (linguistics), and whether this is true or not, I've internalized that I'm never going to be the whiz kid of hard coding skills and deep mathematical and algorithmic knowledge. I do think a humanities background tends to help with communication, asking questions, and defining a problem, especially compared to many of the pure CS grads I've worked with. On some level the tools don't *really* matter too much, you're solving a similar set of problems and you'll have to use whatever tools the company you work for has available. I lean on my ability to learn when I've had to pick up new tools, workflows, and programming languages - so far so good.\n\nObviously it's good to have a few areas where you build deep expertise, but I think this happens as a matter of course for most people anyway. I think there's probably some trade off where deeply specializing early on can net you higher pay sooner, with a somewhat higher risk of getting really good at something that doesn't exist in a few years. \n\nAll of that being said, we're really talking about two extreme ends of a spectrum. Most people are going to end up de facto specialists in little sub niches over the course of a career, even if they are relative generalists in data tech.",

Data people are being Data&AI Engineers or full-stack data people.\n\nI also see, most of the companies are removing lots of their dashboards, keeping only the very fundamental ones. For the rest, you should build your data model & semantic layer. AI is doing the rest.\n\nEdit: Also, I forgot to say, maybe you should hire a data consultant for 1 day a week to check your data models & give you recommendations on architecture.

Probably as other have said around a title similar to analytics engineer.\n\nMy guess is we end up with 3 core engineer roles - AI, Platform & Analytics.  With the other key areas being governance/data management.\n\nId just suggest starting to specialise in a function rather than focussing on an individual tools, after all, Excel will probably be flavour of the month again in a year or two 😂",

Most of the time it knows exactly which tool to use, where to look in the codebase, which approach to pick, how to structure folders, and how to test properly.\n\nThat said, the best coding model right now is GPT-5.2-Codex. When you combine it with Claude Code via a proxy, the result is insanely good. I tested Codex on the CLI today and was genuinely blown away. I don’t know how long it’s been performing at this level, but I’m here to say it clearly: Claude Code is no longer the king.",

Currency conversions are mildly annoying too\n\n**What I found (sharing in case useful):**\n\n**Easiest income thresholds for US citizens:**\n\n\\- Georgia: $2,000/month (Remotely from Georgia program)\n\n\\- Mauritius: $1,500/month (Premium Visa)\n\n\\- Mexico: $3,600/month (Temporary Resident)\n\n\\- Indonesia: $2,000/month (B211A Second Home - 5 years!)\n\n**Surprisingly high requirements:**\n\n\\- UAE: $5,000/month + $100k insurance\n\n\\- Iceland: $7,000/month\n\n\\- Thailand LTR: $80,000/year income requirement\n\n\\- Estonia: €4,500/month\n\n**Family-friendly options (allow dependents):**\n\nSpain, Croatia, Italy, Malta, Greece, Mexico, Mauritius, Indonesia, Barbados, Romania\n\n**Freelancer vs Employee matters:**\n\n\\- Some programs (Portugal D7, Costa Rica Rentista) don't accept active incomee\n\n\\- Czech Zivno is specifically for self-employed\n\n\\- Most others accept any remote work type\n\nThe \"local work\" gotcha:\n\n\\- Spain allows 20% local work\n\n\\- Japan allows 28% local work\n\n\\- Most others: 0% (you can't work for local companies at all)\n\n**I ended up building a quick filter tool** to stop losing my mind with spreadsheets. if anyone wants to check my profile (free for first 5 countries, no signup).\n\nBut honestly just wanted to share these findings because I wish someone had compiled this when I started researching.\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\nHope it is not too bad for the first project [https://x.com/5to9live](https://x.com/5to9live)\n\nI plan to do 1 project every day",

      "text": "Hello guys, hoping you're having a good day.\n\nI do this post if it helps for information for some users that don't know about switches.\n\nBefore anything, I have all the switches I mention on this post but the PCIe 5.0 ones and PEX88080 one. All bought from aliexpress, and all working fine, ranging from 100 to 500USD. If you're interested in the links let me know!\n\nAlso, English isn't my first language, so if you found something not written correctly also let me know!\n\nWhat are PCIe switches?\n\nPCIe switches like the Broadcom PEX88000 (Gen4) and PEX89000 (Gen5) series are essentially **packet-routing fabrics** for PCIe. They're non-transparent bridges that create a hierarchical PCIe topology, allowing multiple downstream devices to share one or more upstream ports connecting to the CPU's root complex.\n\nThink of them as Ethernet switches but for PCIe packets. They contain:\n\n* One or more **upstream ports** (connecting toward the CPU)\n* Multiple **downstream ports** (connecting to endpoints like GPUs)\n* An internal **crossbar switch fabric** that routes TLP (Transaction Layer Packets) between ports\n\nFor example one of them looks the one of the picture, also some ones look like this:\n\n[X16 4.0 upstream via dual SlimSAS 8i uplink to 4\\*X16 4.0 slots + 2 SlimSAS 8i downstream](https://preview.redd.it/c0gd2u9jdr8g1.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e4f49e6e908c5a04761a53df1b617af73c6c584)\n\nWhat are some other benefits of switches?\n\n* You don't need PCIe bifurcation motherboard support, the PLX/PEX switch inside does everything.\n   * So for example you can split a X4 slot into X1/X1/X1/X1, or X2/X1/X1, etc and dynamically, those limits will happen when you use everything fully at the same time.\n* It works out of the box, you can boot on drives attached to them, and for either OS Linux or Windows.\n* As PCIe is birectional, it helps a lot for P2P.\n\nWould you wonder, how do they create so many slots from a single one?\n\nYou don't magically get more bandwidth than the slot offers (i.e. 32 GiB/s bidirectional), but if you use 2 PCIe 4.0 slots on that switch for example, you could get about 64GiB/s total if you write to one side and read from the other.\n\nThe switch presents multiple independent downstream ports (say, 4× x16 slots), each appearing as a separate PCIe link to the devices attached.\n\nWhen GPU-A sends a TLP to system memory, the switch routes it through the crossbar to the upstream port. When GPU-B does the same, traffic is interleaved/arbitrated. The switch handles flow control, credit management, and QoS.\n\nSo then, traffic between downstream ports (GPU-to-GPU P2P) can traverse the switch fabric **without going through the upstream port at all**. This is why switches are valuable for multi-GPU—you could get full local bandwidth for P2P transfers.\n\nAnother switch example are these ones:\n\n**PEX88024 (PCIe 4.0 X8 to 4 PCIe 4.0 X4 M2)**\n\n[PEX88024 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/rkwzvadher8g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e9c6749d058f7807821f36ac4b8b1764dcee6da)\n\n**PLX88048 (PCIe 4.0 X16 to 8 PCIe 4.0 X4 M2 and 2 SlimSAS 8i to 2x 4i each)**\n\n[PLX88048 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/r2e6r46ser8g1.png?width=2632&format=png&auto=webp&s=08550c17b3cc9030f23eba9136b7aa82cbfb0973)\n\n**PEX88048 variant: PCIE 4.0 X16 to 4 SlimSAS 8i (or 4x8 PCIe 4.0). In this one you can do either X16/X16, X8/X8/X8/X8, or X4/X4/X4/X4/X4/X4/X4/X4.**\n\n[PEX88048 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/thoa2y33fr8g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b985311a163b62c984aad4ee08c9f37e19f182fb)\n\n**PEX88080 (X16 4.0 to 4\\*X16 4.0 slots)**\n\n[PEX88080 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/gadycyqffr8g1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d4e4de1add14208c0399c53b40115dc3468b392)\n\n**PLX88096 (Already shown one on the start, so here it is another one). PCIe X16 4.0 to 10 SlimSAS 8i ports: Supports 5\\*X16 4.0, or 10\\*X8 4.0, or 20\\*X4 4.0.**\n\n[PEX88096 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/1yhj5ud4gr8g1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d43c727d23143aa8487e007fca7554585e5eb67)\n\n**PEX89048: PCIe 5.0 X16 uplink to 4xMCIO 8i ports (so you can do X16/X16 5.0, or X8/X8/X8/X8 5.0, or 8\\*X4 5.0)**\n\n[Rocket 1628A, PEX89048 Switch](https://preview.redd.it/mf1dp5qegr8g1.png?width=1065&format=png&auto=webp&s=16d9d8d4b277d3d1824a23c5a82cd26da9789243)\n\nSo what are the demerits for something that sounds so good?\n\n* It is expensive, like a LOT more expensive than bifurcation cards.\n* It add latency in the ns terms, which may or not affect your workload.\n* Requires something external on your PC vs just enabling bifurcation on your motherboard BIOS.\n\nA good table comparison would be:\n\n# PCIe Switch vs. Bifurcation\n\n|Aspect|Bifurcation|PCIe Switch|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**What it is**|CPU/chipset configuration that splits a single physical slot's lanes|Active silicon device with its own logic|\n|**Hardware**|No additional hardware (just BIOS setting)|Requires switch chip ($$$)|\n|**Bandwidth**|Divides lanes statically (x16 → 2×8, 4×4, etc.)|Shares bandwidth dynamically via arbitration|\n|**Device visibility**|Each bifurcated segment is a direct CPU link|Devices sit behind switch in topology hierarchy|\n|**P2P traffic**|Must traverse CPU root complex|Can route locally within switch fabric|\n|**Latency**|Lower (direct to root complex)|Slightly higher (extra hop through switch)|\n|**Flexibility**|Fixed by BIOS/physical slot|Can be reconfigured, supports hot-plug|\n|**Cost**|Free|Significant (switch chips are expensive)|\n\n# Practical Example\n\n**Bifurcation scenario**: Your motherboard has an x16 slot. You set BIOS to 4×4 bifurcation and use a passive riser to install four NVMe drives. Each drive gets a dedicated x4 link straight to the CPU, but you've \"spent\" 16 lanes from your CPU's lane budget.\n\n**Switch scenario**: You have an x16 slot connected to a PEX88096 card. That card provides 4× x16 downstream slots (64 lanes downstream from 16 upstream). Four GPUs can each negotiate x16 links. They share the x16 upstream bandwidth to CPU, but GPU-to-GPU P2P gets full switch fabric bandwidth (no CPU bottleneck). You've still only \"spent\" 16 CPU lanes.\n\n# Real Example\n\nOn Servethehome, an user got the first PLX88096 switch and tested with 3090s, and also a 5.0 one and tested with 5090s.

          "text": "I don’t know if this is what you’re looking for, but I spent some time looking at infographic inspiration online, and then saving the ones I like to a folder on my computer. Then I’d take one and upload it to Gemini and ask it to give me a prompt I can use to replicate the style on NotebookLM and had good success with it. \n\nFor example: \n\n“Please describe in detail the design and aesthetic qualities of this infographic which I will use to replicate my own infographic on NotebookLM with the same design. Make sure to include colors, layout, fonts, feel, vibe, etc. I do not need to know the content of the infographic (the words, titles, images, etc). Do not produce an image.”\n\nThis is an example output it gave me which I would edit in notebook if I needed to tweak:\n\n“This is a detailed description of the design and aesthetic qualities of the infographic, organized by category to help you replicate the style.\n1. Overall Vibe and Aesthetic\nThe infographic has a distinct retro-futuristic, isometric style. It feels clean, professional, and modern but draws inspiration from mid-20th-century technical illustrations or blueprints due to its restricted color palette and geometric approach. It communicates a journey or process in a clear, structured, and slightly playful way. The overall finish is matte and clean, resembling a high-quality print on textured paper rather than a glossy digital screen.\n2. Color Palette\nThe design strictly adheres to a tight duotone/tritone color scheme, which is crucial to its identity:\n * Primary Color (Accent & Highlights): A deep, warm, desaturated burnt orange/terra cotta red. This is used for titles, the main path (road), key visual objects, arrows, and important highlights.\n * Secondary Color (Structure & Shadow): A neutral, warm taupe/medium grey. This is used for body text, the sides of 3D objects to create depth (shadows), structural bases, and subtle outlines.\n * Background Color: A clean off-white/cream. It is not a stark, bright white, contributing to the softer, printed feel.\nThere are zero gradients. All shading is achieved through solid blocks of the secondary grey color placed against the primary red or the white background.\n3. Layout and Structure\n * The Journey Metaphor: The central organizing principle is a winding, isometric road that starts at the top left and zigzags down to the bottom right. This creates a clear, sequential \"Z\" flow for the viewer's eye to follow.\n * Modular Nodes: Along this path, distinct visual scenes (modules) branch off. Each module represents a specific point and is connected to the main road, creating a cohesive ecosystem of illustrations.\n * Text Connecting to Visuals: Text blocks are situated near their corresponding visual modules. Thin, solid lines (in the primary red color), often ending in subtle arrowheads, connect specific parts of the illustration directly to the descriptive text, ensuring no confusion about what text belongs to what image.\n * Use of Negative Space: There is ample white space around the winding road and text blocks, keeping the layout uncluttered and easy to navigate despite the amount of information.\n4. Illustration Style\n * Isometric Perspective: All elements—buildings, cars, objects, and the road itself—are rendered in a consistent isometric view (3D without vanishing points). Lines remain parallel, giving everything a geometric, architectural feel.\n * Flat Design with Hard Shadows: The illustrations are essentially \"flat design,\" but depth is created entirely through hard-edged blocks of the taupe/grey color acting as shadows on the sides of objects. There is no soft shading or feathering.\n * Simplified Geometry: Objects are stylized and simplified into basic geometric shapes rather than realistic depictions. They are highly symbolic icons (e.g., a simple house shape, a blocky car).\n * Playful Scale: The scale of objects is metaphorical rather than realistic. For example, a magnifying glass, coins, or a padlock might be drawn as large as a building or a car to emphasize their conceptual importance.\n5. Typography and Hierarchy\nThe typography is clean and utilizes a clear hierarchy based on size, weight, and color.\n * Main Title (Top Left): This is the largest element. It uses a very bold, condensed, stylized sans-serif font. It is dynamic, with massive numerical emphasis, setting the tone for the rest of the piece.\n * Section Headers: These use a bold, clean, standard sans-serif font set in the primary burnt orange/red color. They are prominent but significantly smaller than the main title.\n * Body Text: This uses a highly legible, regular weight, clean sans-serif font set in the secondary taupe/grey color. It is much smaller than the headers.”",

      "text": "Hey r/selfhosted,\n\nThis is Vihar from Plane. I'm excited to share what we've been working on. Your feedback from our v1.0 announcement was incredibly valuable.\n\n>For those new to Plane, it's an open-core project management system designed as a self-hosted alternative to tools like Jira. We focus on speed, reliability, and extensibility, with our Community Edition licensed under AGPL-3.0.\n\nGitHub link: [https://github.com/makeplane/plane](https://github.com/makeplane/plane)\n\nToday, we're sharing Plane `v1.2.0`, and `v1.2.1`, a release focused on refining the user experience, supercharging workflows, and hardening security.\n\n# What's New in v1.2.0\n\nWhile our v1.0 release was about building a stable foundation and migrating our front end to `React Router + Vite`, v1.2.0 is about making Plane faster and more intuitive to use every day.\n\n**A Redesigned Navigation Experience**\n\nWe've completely overhauled navigation to reduce visual noise and make moving across your workspace faster. Project-specific features like Cycles, Modules, and Pages are now neatly organized as horizontal tabs within each project.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07g3x5cpkr8g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a684541307680d08cca12f87ab4a062ad4d210d\n\n**Power K, Supercharged**\n\nWe believe in keyboard-first workflows. With the new Power K command menu, you can now do almost anything without touching your mouse. Contextual shortcuts are available in every work item and page, allowing you to instantly create issues, navigate projects, toggle sidebars, and much more.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rtbf5uqkr8g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=26bc2d943e69813b4c2e089fd0b9a4cb9892849c\n\n**Triage State for Intake**\n\nTo make managing incoming requests cleaner, we've introduced a dedicated Triage state for our Intake feature. All new requests land here first, allowing you to process them without cluttering your project's active states. This keeps your boards focused on work-in-progress.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dxw5kx4skr8g1.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6b91a85be5853d7bab028167dda8c615a3f772b\n\n# Technical Enhancements & Security\n\n• Security Hardening: We've patched several vulnerabilities, including upgrading Next.js and React to address CVE-2025-66478 and CVE-2025-55182 (both related to RCE ). We also upgraded Django to 4.2.27 to mitigate a potential SQL injection vulnerability and updated our Nginx version.\n\n• API Expansion: We've added new endpoints for workspace invitations and project member management, along with external APIs for Stickies.\n\n• Improved Reliability: We implemented a fallback mechanism in our editor to prevent data loss during connection interruptions. We also fixed bugs related to activity timeline ordering, calendar layouts, and API responses.\n\nWe're proud of this release and believe it makes Plane a more powerful and enjoyable tool for self-hosted teams. As always, we're eager to hear your feedback.\n\nWe also did a quick summary of what we've shipped in 2025, in case if you're [curious](https://plane.so/plane-in-2025).\n\nThank you for being part of our journey.\n\n\\~ Team Plane",

As far as I know, you'd be the first person trying it apart from myself.

The confidence threshold approach for handling missing context is smart, especially with smaller models that tend to fabricate connections between unrelated chunks. Your experience with existing tools not giving enough control over synthesis behavior matches what a lot of people run into when they need more than basic RAG.\n\nThe chunk size tuning you're doing is where most RAG systems live or die, but it's usually a black box until you're already seeing bad retrieval results. I built vectorflow.dev to get visibility into exactly what your chunks look like before they hit the vector store, since debugging retrieval issues after the fact is painful. What's your process been like for tuning those hierarchical sizes, and are you mostly eyeballing the chunk quality or using some automated metrics?",

I built up a set of test prompts designed to hit specific sources (different books, papers, sections) and manually evaluated whether the retrieved chunks had enough context to answer correctly without hallucination.\n\nSo no automated metrics - to be honest, didn't even know that's a thing. I will most certainly read up on your work and relevant literature.\n\nBut really, your comment is exactly why I decided to post here - to learn from you guys. Thank you! Any further advise on how best to move forward implementing auto metrics, via vectorflow or the custom way (LLamaIndex, RAGAS etc), I'd greatly appreciate it.",

I don't cover it here, but in my C# reference implementation, I did allow passing a \"template\" grid which filters each line/column's possibilities. A template can also have letters in it, e.g. if you know you want to have a puzzle with a few specific pre-written (e.g. themed) clues. This is not quite the same as choosing a strict layout ahead of time, as it still has the flexibility to insert *extra* black squares, but it kindof works.\n\nWhen I first designed this, I was thinking both problems are NP Complete so might as well \"solve\" the \"harder\" one. That said, I do think the problem space is quite difference, and so the performance difference is probably a large polynomial between one and the other.",

It breaks down the learning process into actionable steps, complete with research, summarization, and testing. It builds out a framework for you. You'll still have to get it done.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    [SUBJECT]=Topic or skill to learn\n    [CURRENT_LEVEL]=Starting knowledge level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)\n    [TIME_AVAILABLE]=Weekly hours available for learning\n    [LEARNING_STYLE]=Preferred learning method (visual/auditory/hands-on/reading)\n    [GOAL]=Specific learning objective or target skill level\n    \n    Step 1: Knowledge Assessment\n    1. Break down [SUBJECT] into core components\n    2. Evaluate complexity levels of each component\n    3. Map prerequisites and dependencies\n    4. Identify foundational concepts\n    Output detailed skill tree and learning hierarchy\n    \n    ~ Step 2: Learning Path Design\n    1. Create progression milestones based on [CURRENT_LEVEL]\n    2. Structure topics in optimal learning sequence\n    3. Estimate time requirements per topic\n    4. Align with [TIME_AVAILABLE] constraints\n    Output structured learning roadmap with timeframes\n    \n    ~ Step 3: Resource Curation\n    1. Identify learning materials matching [LEARNING_STYLE]:\n       - Video courses\n       - Books/articles\n       - Interactive exercises\n       - Practice projects\n    2. Rank resources by effectiveness\n    3. Create resource playlist\n    Output comprehensive resource list with priority order\n    \n    ~ Step 4: Practice Framework\n    1. Design exercises for each topic\n    2. Create real-world application scenarios\n    3. Develop progress checkpoints\n    4. Structure review intervals\n    Output practice plan with spaced repetition schedule\n    \n    ~ Step 5: Progress Tracking System\n    1. Define measurable progress indicators\n    2. Create assessment criteria\n    3. Design feedback loops\n    4. Establish milestone completion metrics\n    Output progress tracking template and benchmarks\n    \n    ~ Step 6: Study Schedule Generation\n    1. Break down learning into daily/weekly tasks\n    2. Incorporate rest and review periods\n    3. Add checkpoint assessments\n    4. Balance theory and practice\n    Output detailed study schedule aligned with [TIME_AVAILABLE]\n\nMake sure you update the variables in the first prompt: SUBJECT, CURRENT\\_LEVEL, TIME\\_AVAILABLE, LEARNING\\_STYLE, and GOAL\n\nIf you don't want to type each prompt manually, you can run the Agentic Workers, and it will run autonomously.\n\nEnjoy!",

A 'pipeline' is essentially a collection of tools such as AI models or general data transformations/tasks which can then easily be called instantly via API as each pipeline can have it's own API keys and an endpoint. (Built directly on Cloudflare which gives it some pretty nice performance. Still yet to do proper benchmarking however).",

User input (to be used as a last name) -> 2. Fake data generator for a first name -> 3. Extract first name from Faker data using a JSON path query -> 4. Combine API call provided last name + the extracted first name name -> 5. For a random extra transformation, SHA-256 hashed the entire faker data JSON -> 6. Combined it to return something like the following: Norberto last-name-229: 8ae58c0bfd6e27c6172e2c3af0fd540f5d53d176cff5e9e8c5407b07fd79235d\n\nResults: 500 successful API calls with printed results in my terminal in \\~4 seconds (the response also contained execution metrics).

Skylight is a pretty good one, and comes on its own tablet/device, but still mostly good for younger kids. So, I built Family Flow. It is built for families with/without kids, kids of any age, built in rewards (like Skylight) but incorporates AI optimization for chores and commuting. It will take all open chores/tasks, and depending on the time to complete AND wait time (think of time washer/dryer run that you cannot \"do\" laundry) and will prioritize them to maximize productive time. It will do similar for multiple sequential/overlapping calendar events - you mark which ones require driving to the event, which family members are able to drive, and it will coordinate the drivers/events to accommodate the most efficient approach based on time, people, drivers, and locations. \n\n  \nIt's working well for us so far and I'm ready (not really, but we're doing it anyway lol) to share with other for testing and feedback. Learned a lot, especially around integrating with Stripe... but use the code **FORTHEFAM2026** for 30 days of Premium free and test out all the features.",

We organized what should have been a simple pancake sale. The admin nightmare that followed was ridiculous - logging into the bank account multiple times a day to check payments, manually tracking who paid, cross-referencing lists, making sure fundraiser money didn't get mixed with operational funds. It was inefficient and ate up hours of volunteer time.\n\nAs a developer, I thought: there has to be a better way.\n\n**The solution:** I built [payit.be/en](https://payit.be/en) \\- a payment platform specifically designed for non-profits, sports clubs, youth organizations, schools, and community groups running events and fundraisers. It automates payment tracking, sends confirmations, and keeps everything organized without the manual busywork.\n\nWe use Stripe Connect to handle the actual payment processing, which means each organization gets payments directly into their own account while we handle all the technical complexity and compliance stuff behind the scenes.\n\nWhat started as a tool to make my own life easier now has around 200 active customers - sports clubs, parent councils, youth groups, service clubs, and schools across Belgium.\n\n**Here's my challenge:** Right now, most of our customers are within a 50km radius of our location - basically our personal network and word-of-mouth referrals. I'd love to hear your tips and advice on how to break out of that bubble and reach organizations nationally (or even internationally). How do you scale beyond your own network when you're solving a real problem but struggling with visibility?\n\nHappy to answer questions about the tech stack, the journey from side project to actual product, or anything else!",

It was the start of a bit of a schism in the organization. \n\nThe ISC2 990s can all be pulled from a variety of online resources as a non-profit. The organization was doing very well financially with security professionals leading it. However, I think the boards at the time somehow got sold on the idea of measuring success not by member satisfaction or reputation but, rather, based on sheer number of members.\n\nIf we look at the past six years or so, professional development resources have disappeared. Any that are left are fee-based and remarkably novice in their nature. In the meantime, management has grown significantly (again, just check executive compensation under the 990s), and much of the resources of the organization have moved from servicing experienced security professionals (CISSPs) to luring 1 million zero-experience people to the entry CC certification and membership. It's 180-degree pivot in mission.\n\nIt's a very different organization than it was seven or eight years ago, and based on his background, I don't see Beale changing that course. I know in my circle, some folks have already left the ISC2; they have the credentials or reputation where their CISSP is already superfluous. That said, I would say probably more feel trapped; they need to keep paying their annual fees even though they receive very little in exchange simply to keep the credential. That said, I think \"former CISSP\" will someday carry plenty of weight on a resume. I know I wouldn't hold it against someone at hiring (it might even work in their favor).",

Additionally, you figure to get 1 million CC members would require something like marketing to 10 million people, some percentage of them communicating with customer service as to how they get their \"free CC.\" If you look at the community section of the site, which used to be a nice place to converse on security topics, it's inundated now with CC customer service requests. Considering the amount of management we have and their compensation (CEO pulls down $1 million), we seem to have grown the speech makers rather than the work-doers, and this shows up the customer service delays.",

Turns out it was my complete lack of a launch process beyond \"post on Product Hunt and pray.\"\n\nThe breakthrough came when I started reading real founder timelines inside FounderToolkit. What shocked me was how few people relied on a single launch day. They all did systematic 2-week campaigns across 20+ directories and communities, with specific copy for each platform and realistic signup expectations. I decided to stop reinventing and just follow one of those exact playbooks. For my fourth attempt, I used [FounderToolkit's](http://foundertoolkit.org) validation scripts first to confirm demand through 25 customer conversations. Got 11 explicit \"yes I'd pay\" responses before building. Then I followed their 14-day launch calendar to the letter: day 1 Product Hunt, day 2 BetaList, day 3 Indie Hackers, day 4 niche subreddit, and so on through 22 total channels. Each submission used copy templates from the toolkit that had worked for other founders. Instead of generic \"check out my new SaaS,\" it was specific problem-solution-pain point language. The result was 82 signups over two weeks versus 8-12 from my previous single-day launches. Sixteen converted to paying customers immediately.\n\nNow at $1,800 MRR three months later. The product isn't dramatically better than my previous attempts. What changed was treating launch like a process with proven steps from FounderToolkit instead of a random event. Seeing the exact channels, copy, and timelines other founders used gave me a map instead of guesswork.",

Somehow, 50 steps (of course at appropriate CFG values) not only looks less polished but also has weaker prompt adherence. \n\nPerhaps someone can explain why it does that. Perhaps it has something to do with the way Comfy implemented their encoding nodes (maybe a bad choice of a system prompt?). \n\nNote that I am using the Q8 model.",

I’ve worked at a tech startups where sales would promise the world to the clients  and then come back to us (dev team) with outrageous requests marked “urgent” (so everything was urgent… I had folders for “urgent, urgenter and urgentiestest” to put requests in (which was just low, med and high).  And shareholders have a way to being short sited and wanting their money back with big profits… so it leaves the CEO coming up with stupid ideas he got from an influencer and thus…the seeds of “enshittification” are planted just waiting for a corporate buyout like Adobe.\n\nComfyUi, if you’re reading this… please consider making something for users and not your shareholders’ pocket change and wet dreams for shit.",

      "text": "Hey there!\n\nEver felt overwhelmed by the idea of designing complex flowcharts for your projects? I know I have! This prompt chain helps you simplify the process by breaking down your flowchart creation into bite-sized steps using Mermaid's syntax.\n\n**Prompt Chain:**\n\n```\nStructure Diagram Type: Use Mermaid flowchart syntax only. Begin the code with the flowchart declaration (e.g. flowchart) and the desired orientation. Do not use other diagram types like sequence or state diagrams in this prompt. (Mermaid allows using the keyword graph as an alias for flowchart docs.mermaidchart.com , but we will use flowchart for clarity.) Orientation: Default to a Top-Down layout. Start with flowchart TD for top-to-bottom flow docs.mermaidchart.com . Only switch to Left-Right (LR) orientation if it makes the logic significantly clearer docs.mermaidchart.com . (Other orientations like BT, RL are available but use TD or LR unless specifically needed.) Decision Nodes: For decision points in the flow, use short, clear question labels (e.g., “Qualified lead?”). Represent decision steps with a diamond shape (rhombus), which Mermaid uses for questions/decisions docs.mermaidchart.com . Keep the text concise (a few words) to maintain clarity in the diagram. Node Labels: Keep all node text brief and action-oriented (e.g., “Attract Traffic”, “Capture Lead”). Each node’s ID will be displayed as its label by default docs.mermaidchart.com , so use succinct identifiers or provide a short label in quotes if the ID is cryptic. This makes the flowchart easy to read at a glance. Syntax-Safety Rules Avoid Reserved Words: Never use the exact lowercase word end as any node ID or label. According to Mermaid’s documentation, using \"end\" in all-lowercase will break a flowchart docs.mermaidchart.com . If you need to use “end” as text, capitalize any letter (e.g. End, END) or wrap it in quotes. This ensures the parser doesn’t misinterpret it. Leading \"o\" or \"x\": If a node ID or label begins with the letter “o” or “x”, adjust it to prevent misinterpretation. Mermaid treats connections like A--oB or A--xB as special circle or cross markers on the arrow docs.mermaidchart.com . To avoid this, either prepend a space or use an uppercase letter (e.g. use \" oTask\" or OTask instead of oTask). This way, your node won’t accidentally turn into an unintended arrow symbol. Special Characters in Labels: For node labels containing spaces, punctuation, or other special characters, wrap the label text in quotes. The Mermaid docs note that putting text in quotes will allow “troublesome characters” to be rendered safely as plain text docs.mermaidchart.com . In practice, this means writing something like A[\"User Input?\"] for a node with a question mark, or quoting any label that might otherwise be parsed incorrectly. Validate Syntax: Double-check every node and arrow against Mermaid’s official syntax. Mermaid’s parser is strict – “unknown words and misspellings will break a diagram” mermaid.js.org – so ensure that each element (node definitions, arrow connectors, edge labels, etc.) follows the official spec. When in doubt, refer to the Mermaid flowchart documentation for the correct syntax of shapes and connectors docs.mermaidchart.com . Minimal Styling: Keep styling and advanced syntax minimal. Overusing Mermaid’s extended features (like complex one-line link chains or excessive styling classes) can make the diagram source hard to read and maintain docs.mermaidchart.com . Aim for a clean look – focus on the process flow, and use default styling unless a specific customization is essential. This will make future edits easier and the Markdown more legible. Output Format Mermaid Code Block Only: The response should contain only a fenced code block with the Mermaid diagram code. Do not include any explanatory text or markdown outside the code block. For example, the output should look like: ```mermaid graph LR A(Square Rect) -- Link text --> B((Circle)) A --> C(Round Rect) B --> D{Rhombus} C --> D ``` This ensures that the platform will directly render the flowchart. The code block should start with the triple backticks and the word “mermaid” to denote the diagram, followed immediately by the flowchart declaration and definitions. By returning just the code, we guarantee the result is a properly formatted Mermaid.js flowchart ready for visualization. Generate a FlowChart for Idea ~ Generate another one ~ Generate one more\n```\n\n\n**How it works:**\n- **Step-by-Step Prompts:** Each prompt is separated by a ~, ensuring you generate one flowchart element after another.\n- **Orientation Setup:** It begins with `flowchart TD` for a top-to-bottom orientation, making it clear and easy to follow.\n- **Decision Nodes & Labels:** Use brief, action-oriented texts to keep the diagram neat and to the point.\n- **Variables and Customization:** Although this specific chain is pre-set, you can modify the text in each node to suit your particular use case.\n\n**Examples of Use:**\n- Brainstorming sessions to visualize project workflows.\n- Outlining business strategies with clear, sequential steps.\n- Mapping out decision processes for customer journeys.\n\n**Tips for Customization:**\n- Change the text inside the nodes to better fit your project or idea.\n- Extend the chain by adding more nodes and connectors as needed.\n- Use decision nodes (diamond shapes) if you need to ask simple yes/no questions within your flowchart.\n\nFinally, you can supercharge this process using Agentic Workers. With just one click, run this prompt chain to generate beautiful, accurate flowcharts that can be directly integrated into your workflow.\n\nCheck it out here: [Mermaid JS Flowchart Generator](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/v1rkqi7e-mermaid-js-flowchart-generator)\n\nHappy charting and have fun visualizing your ideas!",

I assumed SaaS was a different league requiring genius ideas or marketing magic.\n\nReality check came from browsing FounderToolkit case studies. Dozens of $1K-$10K MRR indie hackers weren't building \"killer apps,\" they were solving obvious problems for obvious audiences using dead-simple validation. Their first step was always 20+ customer conversations with ruthless \"would you pay X?\" filtering. I copied that exactly. Picked a niche workflow problem I'd heard complaints about. Used [FounderToolkit's](http://foundertoolkit.org/) DM templates and interview questions to message 45 people who'd posted about it online. Got 18 responses, 12 confirmed the pain was real and worth paying to solve. That's when I knew I had something.\n\nBuilt a $29 Carrd landing page using their high-converting structure: headline naming the exact pain, three bullets on solution, clear pricing, one CTA. Posted it in the same communities where I'd found complaints. Woke up to 7 pre-orders totaling $203 before writing a single line of code.\n\n  \nShipped MVP in 18 days using a boilerplate stack from their recommendations. Followed their directory launch checklist for another 62 signups. Now at $900 MRR, all from following FounderToolkit's validation-to-launch sequence instead of my usual \"build and hope\" pattern. The toolkit showed me indie success is 90% execution discipline, 10% idea quality.",

      "text": "Bootstrapped B2B tool selling at $59/month. Spent the first year trying every “growth hack” seen on Twitter product hunts, cold DMs, giveaway threads none of them compounding. Finally decided to pick one boring SEO habit, do it consistently for 5 months, and ignore everything else. DA in low teens, a handful of random blog posts, and ~250 organic visitors/month mostly on branded terms. MRR stuck under $3K, with no channel that felt predictable. The new rule became: one content slot per week, same time, same process, no exceptions.\n\nMonth one was foundation plus focus. Cleaned up site structure, merged a few cannibalized posts, and submitted the domain once through a [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org) to shore up authority and NAP consistency without burning a week on form-filling. Picked 8 very specific buyer-intent topics and created outlines. Results: 310 visitors, 0 net-new customers from organic.\n\nMonth two put the new habit into practice. Published 4 posts in 4 weeks, all tied directly to “I’m ready to switch tools” or “I need to fix X now” type searches. Every article pointed to one relevant landing page and one clear CTA rather than three different offers. Results: 520 visitors, 3 customers from organic, ~$177 MRR.\n\nMonth three started to show compounding. The first two posts from month one nudged onto page one for their main queries. Instead of chasing new topics, updated intros, added micro-FAQs from Search Console data, and tightened the offer at the bottom of each article. Results: 930 visitors, 5 customers from organic (8 total), ~$472 MRR.\n\nMonth four was “more of what’s working.” Published 3 new posts and spent the fourth week purely on upgrades to the top 6 organic landing pages. Added screenshots, better comparison tables, and clarified who the product is not for. Results: 1,420 visitors, 7 new customers (15 total), ~$885 MRR.\n\nMonth five was mostly refinement with minimal new content. Only 2 fresh posts shipped; the rest of the time went into internal links, cleaning up weak pages, and turning one high-traffic article into a full funnel (lead magnet + onboarding sequence). Results: 1,930 visitors, 9 new customers (24 total), ~$1,416 MRR from organic.\n\nWhat changed the trajectory wasn’t a new tactic but the commitment to a boring weekly habit plus small, compounding improvements. Instead of burning a weekend trying “the latest hack,” the team just showed up once a week, shipped one piece of intent-driven content, and made tiny upgrades to the best performers. if you already have a product and some traffic but no compounding channel, one well-defined SEO habit done every week for 4–6 months will usually beat a year of sporadic stunts.",

Other EDRs (Trellix HX, CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, etc.) focus more on process execution, full command lines, script content, parent/child chains, and memory or live response forensics, which still lets you reconstruct attacker activity effectively.\n\nSo Elastic is strong from a Linux UX perspective, but it’s more a design tradeoff than a hard capability gap.",

It just would not work properly on a good third of Linux hosts in the environment. Granted, we had a pretty unpleasant mix of distributions that was part of the problem, but that's kind of how Linux in the enterprise is. Trying to get everyone on the same distro is really difficult. \n\nS1 had it's issues, but at least it would run and give some value vs MS that would take down machines. I suppose that's one way to secure them, just kill them. \n\nI wish I could have spent more time digging into the issues of S1, but our deployment was so rushed because the bosses spent MONTHS haggling out the contract that we were left with almost no time for the actual deployment. \n\nPenny wise and pound foolish that place was. Spend months trying to squeeze the vendor for a few bucks, in the meantime, we're fucking prod left and right as we storm our way through deployment, tickets and incidents flying in the cyclone of our wake.",

When something leaks everyone will be shocked when this has been the reality for a while. \n\n  \nI've seen law firms uploading privileged documents to ChatGPT and healthcare workers uploading patient data to AI chatbots for \"research\". I know it's a grey-area too because these are employees who are not even acting maliciously. They're just trying to hit metrics with whatever tools work.\n\n  \nSo everyone's focused on external threats (especially during the holidays) when the biggest data exfiltration is actively being added to. How are you handling this? Lock everything down and kill productivity, or hope nothing bad happens? Make your own LLM? ",

They’re usually large, noisy, and semi-structured, but they contain real operational value if handled properly. Most organizations either ignore them entirely or dump them straight into a cloud LLM, often without thinking too hard about sensitivity.\n\nI went the opposite route: local LLM, constrained prompts, deterministic preprocessing and post-processing. No training, no broad autonomy, just extraction, summarization, and structure within clear boundaries.\n\nWhat surprised me is how rarely people do this. Not because it’s impossible, but because local setups are perceived as complex or not “serious” compared to cloud tools. In reality, for narrowly scoped tasks, they’re often good enough and far easier to govern.\n\nThat’s where I see the gap today: not model quality, but practical, controlled application design.\n\nIf you are interested, the post is visible over my profile.",

They help me think clearly, explain my reasoning, and move forward with confidence.\n\nHere are 7 you can use right away:\n\n# 1. The Decision Clarifier\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me clarify this decision.\n    Explain:\n    1. What decision I am actually making\n    2. What is noise vs what truly matters\n    3. What happens if I do nothing\n    Decision: [describe situation]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a messy “should we change this process?” debate into one clear decision with real stakes.\n\n# 2. The Options Breakdown\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    List all realistic options I have for this decision.\n    For each option explain:\n    1. Effort required\n    2. Short term outcome\n    3. Long term impact\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me compare 3 paths clearly instead of arguing based on gut feeling.\n\n# 3. The Tradeoff Revealer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    For this decision, explain the main tradeoffs I am accepting with each option.\n    Be honest and direct.\n    Decision: [paste decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made it clear what I was giving up, not just what I was gaining.\n\n# 4. The Risk Scanner\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Identify the biggest risks in this decision.\n    For each risk:\n    1. Why it might happen\n    2. How to reduce it\n    3. What early warning signs to watch for\n    Decision: [paste decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Flagged a dependency issue I had completely missed before rollout.\n\n# 5. The Second Order Thinker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Analyze the second order effects of this decision.\n    Explain what could happen after the obvious outcome.\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me avoid a short term win that would have caused long term team pain.\n\n# 6. The Bias Checker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Point out possible biases affecting my thinking.\n    Explain how each bias might be influencing my decision.\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Called out confirmation bias when I was only looking for data that supported my idea.\n\n# 7. The Final Call Maker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Based on everything above, recommend one clear decision.\n    Explain why it is the best choice given the constraints.\n    End with one sentence I can use to explain this decision to my team.\n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me a clean explanation I could share in a meeting without rambling.\n\nThe difference is simple. I stopped overthinking and started structuring my thinking.\n\nI keep prompts like these saved so I can reuse them anytime.

Not even close to what I expected and it arbitrarily chooses layers, not the intelligent splitting I was expecting. It seems very overtrained on poster style material, so it kinda forces those elements. Plus it gets slow as the number of layers are increased, expected, but the slowdown is pretty huge.\n\nIm waiting for some time to see if there are some implementation fixes that might be patched in. But yeah, its not really a good first impression. Plus I tried everything bf16.\n\nAs for resolution, im fine if it works at the 1328 or something resolution qwen image is supposed to max at. All I want from this model is to intelligently split provided image, or the image I prompt, into sensible layers and do sucessful edits on those predetermined layers. If that stage is done well, layers can be easily upscaled by method of choice later.\n\nOn that note, I was going to experiment json prompting today, where ill define in prompt which layers to have and their contents. Max I can do is 5 layers and that also takes about 2.5h. I will take time hit and try bf16 only, cause I want to see model capabilities. So you can also try different prompting structure in your setup?",

I would get better results seperating and inpainting my images manually.\n\nBut I can see the vision, I hope they improve on this because I would use this for sure, just not the current version.\n\nWhat annoys me though is that everyone on twitter hyped it so much just to be a letdown when I actually got to try it.

Outbound AI is starting to reach consumers and agent runtime environments are giving companies the tools to scale AI agents properly.\n\nOther interesting points:  \n\\- Chief AI Officers are becoming a thing. One person should be responsible for data, analytics, and AI. It makes sense.  \n\\- Contractors and consultants who haven’t actually deployed agentic AI are going to get exposed.  \n\\- Transparency is going to matter more than ever. People want to see how AI makes decisions.  \n\\- Agents as buyers: AI shopping on your behalf, following a budget, and making decisions without emotion.  \n\\- Simulation is going to be massive.\n\n2026 looks like agents gaining autonomy and companies needing proper infrastructure before just throwing AI at problems.\n\nThat’s a lot, but I’m curious: what are your predictions for agentic AI in 2026?",

Companies that skip building proper evaluation, monitoring, and orchestration infrastructure are going to hit walls fast. You can't just throw agents at problems without the systems to manage them at scale.\n\nTransparency and explainability will separate production agents from demos. When agents make decisions that affect real operations or customer experiences, people need to understand why. Black box agents won't survive in high-stakes environments. We're already seeing this play out with our production systems where observability isn't optional.\n\nThe \"agent as buyer\" concept is interesting but I think we're further out on that than people expect. The infrastructure for agents to transact autonomously across different systems with proper guardrails doesn't really exist yet. We'll see limited versions in closed ecosystems first.\n\nWhat I think gets underestimated is how much foundation work companies need before agents are valuable. If your processes aren't clear, your context isn't organized, and your team doesn't understand what they're automating, agents just amplify the chaos. The companies winning with agents in 2026 will be the ones who did that boring groundwork in 2025.\n\nThe consultant shake-out is real. There's a huge gap between people who've built production agent systems and people who've watched demos. That gap is about to become very obvious.",

Autonomy will advance, but mostly in constrained domains where evaluation, rollback, and human approval are well defined. I think the bigger shift in 2026 is less about agents doing everything and more about organizations formalizing ownership, metrics, and audit paths for agent behavior. Simulation becoming mainstream makes sense because it is one of the few safe ways to test emergent behavior before production. The hype gap will show up fast for teams that skipped data readiness and governance and jumped straight to demos. The quiet winners will be the ones treating agents as part of systems, not as replacements for them.",

It feels like it’s about deciding where autonomy actually makes sense.\n\nA few things seem pretty clear to me.\n\nAutonomous workflows in recruiting are going to become normal. Sourcing, first outreach, basic screening, scheduling. Not as something exciting, but as something expected. Teams that figure this out will just move faster. Teams that don’t will keep wondering why candidates drop off.\n\nRecruiting settles into a real human plus AI setup. AI handles the volume and repetition. Recruiters handle judgment, context, relationship building, and closing. The role doesn’t disappear. It gets more focused.\n\nSkills based hiring finally starts working once agents can actually assess skills through conversations and structured signals, not just keyword matching. Resumes stop being the main filter and become just one input.\n\nCandidate experience improves in quieter ways. Faster responses. Clear updates. Less ghosting. Most candidates don’t care if the first interaction is AI. They care that someone gets back to them and follows through.\n\nGovernance becomes the line in the sand. Any recruiting AI that can’t clearly show what it did, why it did it, and back it up with evidence won’t survive, especially at scale.\n\nBig picture, I think 2026 is when the best recruiting teams stop talking about AI altogether. They just place more candidates per recruiter, with less chaos and fewer dropped conversations.\n\nThat’s the real change I’m watching for.",

It's more that I'm getting sick of the LLM treadmill and hope they come up with something better soon because LLM is looking like a dead end to me. Every model when updated initially seems better - but then after some days or weeks I'm as much or even more frustrated that I was with the previous. \n\nPerhaps there is a type of uncanny valley that applies here? Just the new shine wearing off? Or is it that once they get subscriber numbers up they pull back resources and starve the model?",

The LLM really shows its usefulness in a command line / local environment. Where you can call up any function or any tool. Within the ai apps you’re not really seeing this. But that is the main space where the function of the LLM becomes extremely useful. The chat apps are kinda just marketing candy. To show what the LLMs can do , and if you understand that they have a lot more functionality once you are running them locally and in an environment that is able to take advantage of their functionality more.

I’m exploring AI headshot / AI personal photographer tools as part of a SaaS go‑to‑market stack to keep founder photos consistent across LinkedIn, the homepage, launch posts, and investor decks.\n\nThe model I’m considering is: train a personal AI model on the founder with \\~15 photos, then use that AI photographer to generate studio‑grade images for different campaigns product launch posts, keynote announcements, case studies, and social proof assets. [Looktara](http://looktara.com/), for example, offers bulk one‑time AI photo packages for business, dating, or mixed use starting at $19 for 50 photos, plus subscription plans that function like “hiring your own photographer” with credits per model per month.\n\nFor SaaS builders: has using an AI headshot generator or AI personal photography tool actually helped your founder brand feel more consistent and “fundable” across channels, or do you still rely on a few traditional photoshoots and reuse those assets everywhere?",

However I HATE using figma because regardless how simple a UI component is it would still take an non insignificant time to create a mock up that 95% of the time doesn't even get implemented.\n\nSo i created an AI agent powered by Nano Banana Pro (best image gen model right now) that specializes in creating high-quality UI/UX prototypes in seconds with simple natural language. There are two primary ways you can uses this:\n\n1. ask the AI to create new UI components from blank, e.g. create a web dashboard for a user analytics console\n\n2. upload a picture of your existing UI/product and ask the AI to add/edit components on it (my preferred use case)\n\nYou can use it for free here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator](https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator) . The free limit is sufficient for 95% of use cases so you probably never need to subscribe.\n\nHere is a sample generated UI design by this AI:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4mn0an91oq8g1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff22019afce035a5ad715317438c701e24caaaea",

It wouldn't boot. I didn't really trouble shoot further since I got busy. The project sat for a year as toyed around with Dual 5090, Quad 3090 and 12x MI50 32gb RPC. I got interested in the V100 again after seeing cheap adapters from China. Bought a boat load of 16gb adapter variants since they sold for a song and started putting together with Turbo adapters. Then with the V100 top of mind, I got four of the 32gb SXM2 and went back to the NVLink build.\n\ntldr.

Super cheap access via **Kie.ai's Wan 2.6 API** – about $1.05 for 15s 720p or $1.58 for full 1080p with audio (roughly 30% cheaper than competitors like Fal). Plus, a free Playground to test text-to-video with lip sync, multi-shot image-to-video, or reference-to-video consistency without spending a dime.\n\nI've been pumping out realistic product demos, epic sci-fi trailers, and consistent character narratives – the multi-shot coherence and native audio sync at this price is unreal.\n\nJump in here: [https://kie.ai/wan-2-6](https://kie.ai/wan-2-6?referrer=grok.com)\n\nSearching for affordable Wan 2.6 API for cinematic multi-shot videos, reference-to-video with voice matching, text-to-video native audio generation, or a cheap alternative to Veo/Kling for HD AI videos? This hits different.\n\nAnyone else playing with Wan 2.6 R2V prompts or multi-shot camera control? Share your best results or go-to prompts for longer duration AI videos with natural movement!",

Simple problems I'd have no issue coming up with a solution to on the job.\n\nAt this point I'm desperate for some advice and suggestions on how to overcome this. I find it hard to practice anything in particular due to a different format for each interview. For example, some interviews have the person watching you while you talk through things. This is the worst for me personally, even though I understand the intended outcome/goal.\n\nDoes anyone else also experience high levels of anxiety during the technical portion to the point you blow it?

I was in the games industry and it was very small and networked and mostly based on reputation and references— and this is all pre LinkedIn networking. Technical questions were all domain specific, so for me as a games engine engineer it was linear algebra, lighting models, etc which was stuff I am very comfortable talking about. I had then ran my own consulting studio for 15 years. ‘24 I needed to move out of the consulting biz (long story), never even had heard of Leetcode. First interview I did and was asked to do topological sort and just absolutely flailed. Anywho, the own good thing about the “modern” DSA + system design + behavioral interviews is that you can learn and beat the system — there is an insane amount of resources so it’s just study your ass off. To be honest, while I think the style of interview is an extremely poor predictor of performance and competency, I rather enjoy the DSA stuff and still do the Leetcode daily and think about getting into competitive programming. Long story long I ended up with a FAANG job making double what I did in my best year consulting and honestly enjoying it a lot. Good luck!",

However I HATE using figma because regardless how simple a UI component is it would still take an non insignificant time to create a mock up that 95% of the time doesn't even get implemented.\n\nSo i created an AI agent powered by Nano Banana Pro (best image gen model right now) that specializes in creating high-quality UI/UX prototypes in seconds with simple natural language. There are two primary ways you can uses this:\n\n1. ask the AI to create new UI components from blank, e.g. create a web dashboard for a user analytics console\n\n2. upload a picture of your existing UI/product and ask the AI to add/edit components on it (my preferred use case)\n\nYou can use it for free here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator](https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator) . The free limit is sufficient for 95% of use cases so you probably never need to subscribe.\n\nHere is a sample generated UI design by this AI:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ik7grmbnq8g1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=565a751a3673efe10ddb6b46a7e1f057a39f43ad",

      "text": "Spencer Kornhaber: “This year, \\[artificial intelligence\\] created songs that amassed millions of listens and inspired major-label deals. The pro and anti sides have generally coalesced around two different arguments: one saying AI will leech humanity out of music (which is bad), and the other saying it will further democratize the art form (which is good). The truth is that AI is already doing something stranger. It’s opening a Pandora’s box that will test what we, as a society, really want from music.  \n  \n“The case against AI music feels, to many, intuitive. The model for the most popular platform, Suno, is trained on a huge body of historical recordings, from which it synthesizes plausible renditions of any genre or style the user asks for. This makes it, debatably, a plagiarism machine (though, as the company argued in its response to copyright-infringement lawsuits from major labels last year, ‘The outputs generated by Suno are new sounds’). The technology also seems to devalue the hard work, skill, and knowledge that flesh-and-blood musicians take pride in—and threaten the livelihoods of those musicians. Another problem: AI music tends to be, and I don’t know how else to put this, creepy. When I hear a voice from nowhere reciting auto-generated lyrics about love, sadness, and partying all night, I often can’t help but feel that life itself is being mocked.\n\n“Aversion to AI music is so widespread that corporate interests are now selling themselves as part of the resistance. iHeartRadio, the conglomerate that owns most of the commercial radio stations in the country as well as a popular podcast network, recently rolled out a new tagline: ‘Guaranteed Human’ … \n\n“The AI companies have been refining a counterargument: Their technology actually empowers humanity. In November, a Suno employee named Rosie Nguyen posted on X that when she was a little girl, in 2006, she aspired to be a singer, but her parents were too poor to pay for instruments, lessons, or studio time. ‘A dream I had became just a memory, until now,’ she wrote. Suno, which can turn a lyric or hummed melody into a fully written song in an instant, was ‘enabling music creation for everyone,’ including kids like her.  \n  \n“Paired with a screenshot of an article about the company raising $250 million in funding and being valued at $2.5 billion, Nguyen’s story triggered outrage. Critics pointed out that she was young exactly at the time when free production software and distribution platforms enabled amateurs to make and distribute music in new ways. A generation of bedroom artists turned stars has shown that people with talent and determination will find a way to pursue their passions, whether or not their parents pay for music lessons. The eventual No. 1 hitmaker Steve Lacy recorded some early songs on his iPhone; Justin Bieber built an audience on YouTube.\n\n“But Nguyen wasn’t totally wrong. AI does make the creation of professional-sounding recordings more accessible—including to people with no demonstrated musical skills. Take Xania Monet, an AI ‘singer’ whose creator was reportedly offered a $3 million record contract after its songs found streaming success. Monet is the alias of Telisha ‘Nikki’ Jones, a 31-year-old Mississippi entrepreneur who used Suno to convert autobiographical poetry into R&B. The creator of Bleeding Verse, an AI ‘band’ that has drawn ire for outstreaming established emo-metal acts, told Consequence that he’s a former concrete-company supervisor who came across Suno through a Facebook ad.  \n  \n“These examples raise all sorts of questions about what it really means to create music. If a human types a keyword that generates a song, how much credit should the human get? What if the human plays a guitar riff, asks the software to turn that riff into a song, and then keeps using Suno to tweak and retweak the output?” \n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/3ezpB0mX](https://theatln.tc/3ezpB0mX)",

It was already basically impossible to create genuine successful media on the internet due to the over abundance of creators, now it will be worse. In fact the most popular slop will be likely created by people with significant amounts of money behind it. \n\nBut human created art without AI will get more expensive. Human generated concerts, movies and art gallery admission prices will sky rocket. Human made games will probably become subscription based to generate the most value amongst all the slop. So yay for the rest of us? \n\nSo congrats on wanting to generate music/art/games/movies without having the passion to learn to do it. \n\nYou know those execs that are just ideas men and have all the money so they make what they want and a lot of the time they end up churning out absolute slop (think hallmark movies or any massive financial flops lately). This is what you will also have the power to do, create slop but instead with minimal investment.\n\nNo one will want to consume whatever you prompted AI to create. So it’s pointless. The arts are a waste of compute. It should be illegal to do anything but science with AI, because we’re killing the planet to generate slop.\n\nIt’s still gonna be a whoever has the most resources wins with AI slop like it was before AI. Just now as consumers there will be an unimaginable amount of slop and spam to sift through to find anything worthwhile. And everyone is going to retract and seek human created content. Like the pullback from digital subscription music to renewed interest in vinyl and cassettes. And those aren’t cheap. And will become more expensive.\n\nYou only need to look at the number of games published to steam over the last few years to see how much slop is out there. To think your slop has a chance to compete with automatic slop being deployed all day every day from every corner of the globe is very funny to me. Slop is worthless.\n\nAnd when you consider the studies coming out about the negative impact AI usage is having on users intelligence, can you imagine how much unintelligent slop is gonna be out there 😂",

Because they're not common. \n\nAnd literally, people with less income often comprise the majority of highly artistic people in a given population. Most artists have never been successful anyway, not in the way that let's them do art as their job. So it's not some wealth gap thing, although you do tend to see alot of rich artists, that's only because they were rich before learning how to do art (most of the time) and so they can use their community resources and personal wealth to publicize themselves. \n\n\nAI hasn't democratized art. If anything, its insured that small local artists and fringe artists are just orders of magnitude less likely to ever get any attention because the likihood of anyone actually seeing their work is now much smaller. \n\nI dont even hate ai tools, and im not trying to be an elitist, but calling something \"art\" when a machine shits it out in 3 seconds based on a vague description is not the same as learning to paint, or play an instrument, or honing a good writing style. \n\nAI will definitely help more people learn how to create real art, for the ones that have the discipline to learn and practice, and I think that's a good thing.

      "text": "Ever notice how ChatGPT dumbs things down automatically?\n\nIt over-simplifies. Uses basic analogies. Breaks everything into bite-sized pieces like you can't handle complexity.\n\nSure, it's accessible. But if you're trying to actually master something deep? That hand-holding becomes a ceiling.\n\nSo I stopped letting it baby me.\n\nI opened a fresh chat and used this prompt:\n\n```\nStop simplifying for accessibility. I want depth, not comfort.\n\nAssume I can handle complex ideas, technical language, and nuanced thinking. Don't break things down unless I specifically ask.\n\nGive me the full picture like the frameworks experts use, the subtleties that separate surface knowledge from deep understanding, the second and third-order implications.\n\nDon't skip the hard parts. Don't use analogies unless they add genuine insight. Don't say \"in simple terms\" unless I'm clearly lost.\n\nIf I'm missing foundational knowledge, tell me what to learn first, but don't patronize me with oversimplified explanations.\n\nTreat me like someone capable of intellectual heavy lifting. Challenge me to think at a higher level, not meet me where assumptions say I am.\n\nWhen I ask questions, assume I want the real answer—not the safe, surface-level version.\n```\n\nAlso noticed that it works even better with Memory turned ON so it stops resetting to tutorial mode every conversation.\n\nIt's uncomfortable at first. You'll realize how much you've been intellectually coasting.\n\nBut that's exactly the point.\n\nIf you want more prompts that push past AI's default limitations, check out our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com)",

      "text": "**Suggestion**: If this report is too long for you, copy and paste it into Claude and ask for a TL;DR about the issue of your highest concern.\n\n**Data Used**: All comments from both the Performance, Bugs and Usage Limits Megathread from December 15 to December 22\n\nFull list of Past Megathreads and Reports: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/megathreads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/megathreads/)\n\nDisclaimer: This was entirely built by AI (not Claude). It is not given any instructions on tone (except that it should be Reddit-style), weighting, censorship. Please report any hallucinations or errors.\n\n**NOTE**: r/ClaudeAI is not run by Anthropic and this is not an official report. This subreddit is run by volunteers trying to keep the subreddit as functional as possible for everyone. We pay the same for the same tools as you do. Thanks to all those out there who we know silently appreciate the work we do.\n\n***\n\n# [Analysis] Weekly Megathread Report: The \"Shadow Nerf,\" Broken Apps, and Why Your Limits Are Melting (Dec 15 - Dec 22)\n\n**TL;DR:** It’s been a rough week. Sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. The main issues are a massive perceived reduction in usage limits (likely caused by a \"compaction loop\" bug), the mobile app being totally bricked for many, and Claude Code v2.0.72 being a laggy mess. We found GitHub issues that validate the token burn theories.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Vibe Check (Executive Summary)\nIf you feel like you're going crazy, you aren't. The mood in the sub this week has shifted from \"annoyed\" to \"ready to cancel.\" Long-time Max users ($200/mo tier) are feeling betrayed.\n\nThe general consensus is that Anthropic has \"nerfed\" the limits and \"lobotomized\" the models. While Anthropic marketed Opus 4.5 as a coding god in November, the reality this week has been infrastructure instability and a feeling that they are prioritizing cost-saving over usability.\n\n---\n\n## 2. What’s Broken? (Key Observations)\n\nHere is what you all have been reporting in the Megathread:\n\n### 📉 The \"Shadow Nerf\" (Usage Limits)\n*   **The Drain is Real:** This is the #1 complaint. Limits are draining **2-3x faster** than before.\n*   **Pro Plan Pain:** Users are hitting the 5-hour cap after just a few prompts.\n*   **Weekly Limit Drift:** \"Weekly\" resets are getting weird, with some of you seeing reset timers extending to 9 days instead of 7.\n*   **Expensive Chats:** Even simple \"Hello\" or short queries on Sonnet 4.5 are eating up huge chunks (e.g., 2%) of your daily quota.\n\n### 🐛 Bugs & Stability\n*   **Mobile App is Bricked:** Tons of reports of \"Network Error\" or \"Something went wrong\" on iOS/Android. It won't load history or save chats.\n*   **The \"Compaction\" Loop:** The new feature meant to save context is actually killing workflows. It triggers too early (2-3 turns in) and often fails, causing the model to lose instructions.\n*   **Model Roulette:** You select Opus 4.5, but the chat randomly reverts to Sonnet 4.5 without telling you.\n\n### 🧠 Model Intelligence (Opus/Sonnet 4.5)\n*   **\"Lobotomized\":** Opus 4.5 is being called \"lazy.\" It ignores explicit instructions and refuses to code.\n*   **Lying AI:** A disturbing trend where the model *claims* it updated a file or fixed a bug, but when you check the code, nothing changed.\n*   **Hallucinations:** It's fabricating code updates and failing basic logic checks it used to ace.\n\n### 💻 Claude Code (CLI)\n*   **Lag City:** Version 2.0.72 is being described as having latency like a \"satellite link to the moon.\"\n*   **Visual Bugs:** The \"seizure scroll\" glitch is still there.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The \"Why\" (External Context & GitHub Digging)\n\nWe did some digging outside the subreddit to see if we could validate these feelings. **Good news: It’s not just in your head.**\n\n### 🛑 Validating the \"Shadow Nerf\"\n*   **The Smoking Gun (GitHub Issue #9579):** We found a critical bug tracked on GitHub regarding an **\"Autocompacting Loop.\"**\n*   **What it means:** The tool is getting stuck in a loop where it repeatedly reads files and tries to summarize context without making progress.\n*   **The Result:** This burns through your tokens *invisibly*. You aren't hitting a lower limit; the software is just wasting your allowance due to a bug.\n\n### 🐌 Why Claude Code is Slow\n*   **Regression in v2.0.72 (GitHub #14476 & #14453):** There was a renderer rewrite intended to fix the scrolling bug. Ironically, it broke performance. This explains the extreme input lag and \"API Errors\" everyone is seeing.\n\n### 🔌 Outages\n*   **StatusGator:** Confirmed \"Warning\" statuses around **Dec 21**, which lines up perfectly with the mobile app \"Network Error\" reports. It’s a server-side issue, not your phone.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fixes & Workarounds (Read This!)\n\nUntil Anthropic pushes a patch, here is how you survive:\n\n| **The Problem** | **The Fix** |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Claude Code Lag/Slowness** | **Downgrade immediately.** Run `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.71`. Avoid v2.0.72 like the plague. |\n| **Usage Limits Melting** | **Check for Loops.** If you see \"compaction\" happening over and over, stop. **Switch to API:** If you really need to work, use the Console (Pay-as-you-go). It's cheaper than a useless subscription. |\n| **Mobile App \"Network Error\"** | **Use the Browser.** Go to `claude.ai` on Chrome or Safari mobile. It works fine there. **Update:** Some users had luck updating the app to version `1.251215.47`. |\n| **Context Loss** | **Manual Compaction.** Disable auto-compact if you can, or just restart chats frequently. Don't let the context get huge or the model gets \"lazy.\" |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Emerging Issues to Watch\n*   **Ban Hammer:** A scary number of people are getting banned for \"security reasons\" after simple billing glitches. The automated flagging system seems way too aggressive right now.\n*   **Atlassian:** Jira/Confluence integrations are still shaky for enterprise users, despite some reports of fixes.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Conclusion for Megathread Readers\n\n**The Bottom Line:**\nThis has been arguably one of the most frustrating weeks for the Claude community since the Opus 4.5 launch. The consensus is clear: the service feels significantly downgraded compared to just a month ago. The primary culprit isn't just \"lower limits\" but likely a technical bug in the \"auto-compaction\" feature that is silently burning through your token allowance, making it feel like a \"shadow nerf.\"\n\n**What You Need to Do:**\n1.  **Stop using Claude Code v2.0.72 immediately.** It has a confirmed regression causing lag and token loops. Downgrade to v2.0.71.\n2.  **Abandon the Mobile App for now.** If you are getting \"Network Errors,\" switch to your mobile browser (Chrome/Safari); the app is currently broken for many.\n3.  **Watch your Context.** The \"lobotomized\" behavior of Opus 4.5 is often triggered by the model failing to summarize long chats correctly. Restart conversations frequently to keep the model sharp.\n\n***",

In my case it’s not subtle at all: I can burn through the entire allowance in under an hour, with normal usage that previously would have lasted much longer.\n\nAlso, the recharge/reset timing looks off. The cooldown/refresh doesn’t match the expected schedule, and the behavior feels inconsistent (sometimes it comes back earlier/later than it should, sometimes it doesn’t line up with what the UI suggests). So even aside from “model quality” discussions, the quota mechanics themselves look bugged right now.\n\nFor what it’s worth, I haven’t noticed any particular slowdown on my side, response times feel broadly normal, so this doesn’t look like a “general performance issue” so much as a quota/accounting issue.\n\nIf others are seeing the same thing, it’d be useful to compare: version/build, platform (web vs mobile vs Claude Code), and whether downgrading/upgrading changes the drain rate.\n\nI'm on v2.0.75 + VS Code.",

      "text": "Built a tiny tool on evenings and weekends while working full-time. Couldn’t justify ads and didn’t have energy for daily Twitter threads. Needed something that would grow quietly while life stayed busy. Ended up treating SEO like a savings account: small deposits, consistently, with compounding later. new domain, DA 0, just a landing page and Stripe checkout. No audience, no email list. Time budget: 6-8 hours per week total (product + marketing). Goal: get to $1K MRR in 5-6 months without touching paid channels.\n\nMonth one was structure and set-and-forget authority. Built 3 core pages (who it’s for, how it works, limitations/anti-ICP), plus a very small blog section. Did a one-time [directory submission](http://getmorebacklinks.org) through a service to get out of DR/DA zero and ensure consistent business data across listings. Results: 40 visitors, 1 customer at $19 MRR.\n\nMonth two introduced a simple rule: one problem story post per week. Each article started from a specific thing a user had said (It takes me 40 minutes to do X in Y tool) and turned that into a page titled and structured around that problem. By the end of month two, 4 posts were live. Results: 170 visitors, 4 new customers (5 total), ~$98 MRR.\n\nMonth three was the “almost nothing is happening” stage. Posts started to show up deep in search results (positions 20-40). Instead of panicking, I used the same time window each week to improve headings, add mini-FAQs, and make sure every article had a real narrative instead of generic bullet lists. Results: 420 visitors, 6 new customers (11 total), ~$231 MRR.\n\nMonth four showed the first real slope change. Two early posts reached page one for their main queries, and one comparison-style page hit the top 5. Without increasing hours, the same weekly cadence now works on more leveraged pages. Results: 780 visitors, 10 new customers (21 total), ~$505 MRR.\n\nMonth five was when compounding became obvious. Published 2 net-new posts and spent most of the time improving the top 8 landing pages: shortening intros, adding screenshots, and clarifying pricing. Organic traffic crossed ~1,200 visitors/month, and trials from SEO became the majority of new signups. Results: 1,230 visitors, 12 new customers (33 total), ~$1,089 MRR.\n\nThe important part: total time never exceeded 8 hours/week. The only thing that changed was how much previous work was compounding. Month one felt like depositing $10 into an account; month five felt like watching interest finally hit a level you can see. If you’re building something on the side, you don’t need a massive content schedule. You need a small, weekly deposit into an SEO “savings account,” a one-time push on authority, and enough patience to let the graph bend before you declare it “not working.”",

The hardest work was live streaming and talking about the product on an ongoing basis, even though it wasn’t ready, I was more so just telling people what I was building and inviting them to try something new. The new thing they were trying was a different approach of how things were currently done for the last decade quickly. I was able to get up to 800 newsletter subscribers so when the MVP actually launched we started getting paying customers right away. That’s what works for me. If I could go back in time I would’ve done more videos. I would’ve done more live streams. I would’ve sold the future of the idea of the product more and that’s exactly what I’m doing now.",

Maybe 5 or 6 discussed what an ideal solution would be and the ones that really felt it talked about the user experience they want from a solution.\n\nWhile doing the above I iterated maybe 10-15 times of marketing page content and trying to simplify everything as much as I could, but I never deployed or showed anyone since I didn't feel like the content was 'it'.\n\nTowards the middle - end of my interviewing I was prototyping some solution ideas I had to see if I even cared about the product I was building and to see if it could work as a solution.\n\nI didn't generate a wait list in an official capacity but I did log every chat I had and made sure to ask if I could reach out in the future to showcase a prototype (this is where I'm entering now)\n\nWith that I'm going to try to convert them all into free demos to get product feedback and then launch the public wait list and build a slightly larger community before going full public access. \n\n--\n\nIf I could do one thing differently I would have launched the marketing page with wait-list sign up before I interviewed anyone and then iterated the content of the marketing page after each interview because having something to show makes it easier to discuss the ideal solution and or problem you're building for. I additionally would have included a post wait-list questionnaire to ask some basic questions to validate the level of demand for the product and figure out the pain points they are having. This would have made it faster to catalog info and move faster. I'll likely try it this way next time.\n\n--\n\nAs for 'polished' I struggle with this too and I think it's why I didn't wait list with a marketing page first and why I haven't released what I have made yet for demos. There's always one more bug to fix or adjustments to the user experience etc. to force myself out of this I'm starting to slowly roll out testing to those initial contacts for demos. One at a time then two, then three. This way I can control and fix things without looking like an idiot that shipped something unpolished to a large group of people.",

Dedicated t2i that you can enable multiple controlnets  or detailers, enabling extensions with a checkbox. Send to i2i and work from there... I miss that.\n\nMy sdxl comfy workflow has dynamic prompts, wildcard nodes, embedding nodes, style selector nodes. Going into one facedetailer and an ultimate upscaler. If I want to add multiple detailer, or controlnets, i have to start rewiring everything up again. I know it doesn't take long and I can bypass what I dont need, it is what it is. \n\nWith all this stuff occupying one workflow, comfyui gui starts to slow down and suffer. There are a lot of side speed optimizations I can do with comfyui, and I don't touch any webui anymore, but there's definitely some ease of use lost and if you're focused on creativity and you're new, starting with comfy isn't intuitive.",

Forge, reForged, Forge Classic, Forge Neo and SD.Next are all forks of A1111.\n\nI installed both ComfyUI and Forge, thinking I'd spend most of the time in Forge. Then I discovered the \"Inference\" tab in Stability Matrix.

We don't have thresholds when it comes to other things like this. Like we don't require a certain complexity level to be reached before we call something a database. We need clear terms for these things not something arbitraty that only serves to stroke the human egos of the guys making them.

          "text": "Your observations about the distinction between true agents and simple automation are quite valid. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Definition of Agents**: True agents should possess the ability to adapt and make decisions autonomously based on their environment and the data they process. This includes handling errors and dynamically adjusting their actions without explicit instructions.\n\n- **Error Handling**: As you mentioned, if an agent can autonomously switch tools or modify its approach when encountering an error, it demonstrates a level of intelligence and adaptability that goes beyond basic automation. If it merely follows a predetermined path without the ability to adapt, it leans more towards scripted automation.\n\n- **Marketing vs. Reality**: The term \"agentic\" is often used in marketing to describe systems that may not fully embody the characteristics of true agents. This can lead to confusion about what constitutes an autonomous agent versus a more traditional automated workflow.\n\n- **Autonomy in Production**: While autonomy can enhance flexibility and responsiveness, it also introduces risks, particularly in critical applications. The balance between autonomy and control is essential, and the desired level of autonomy may vary depending on the specific use case and industry requirements.\n\n- **Robust Automation vs. Autonomous Agents**: Robust automation can efficiently handle repetitive tasks and predefined workflows, while autonomous agents should be capable of learning from experiences and adapting to new situations. The line between the two often depends on the complexity of the tasks and the level of decision-making required.\n\nIn summary, the distinction lies in the ability to adapt and respond to changing conditions. True agents should be able to handle unexpected situations autonomously, while simpler automation may lack this capability. \n\nFor further reading on the topic, you might find insights in the following sources:\n- [Agents, Assemble: A Field Guide to AI Agents - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/4sdfypyt)\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)",

However, automation and autonomous are expected to have tradeoffs. So, full autonomy may not be suitable (yet) for every production use case.\n\n\nI agree with your take: a true agent should be able to adapt midway. E.g., in KodeAgent, I begin with a planner and occasionally review the progress with an observer. Sometimes the agent invents tool names or stuck in a loop -- such observations can potentially help.

Also you have little to no control over certain things as you learn more. Especially with front end.\n\nAI is real crap when it comes to front end coding. There are more moving pieces and more to consider than just coding. I rather use a visual builder over having AI do it for me if I didn’t know how to code.\n\nThere will always be something lacking without technical knowledge for example SEO and AEO. I had AI do it on a new SaaS I am working for me. It only did the basics. Difference is if you do it properly other LLMs will pick it up in 24 hours. For example if you ask any AI chat “What is RecoverPay for Stripe” it knows. When I had AI do it by itself it would be like it’s a scam because there used to be a scam site recoverpay.com that acted as a collection agency. Or it would get confused with recovery pay which is a law firm.\n\nGetting it distinguished over similar named business takes time by registering with sites like crunchbase and wikidata. There are bunch of other sites you would want to add and as reference for crawlers but AI won’t do it for you.",

I built a Windows dictation tool for myself and ended up shipping it as a real app.\n\nI basically wanted something simple: hold a hotkey, talk, let it type into whatever I’m in (gmail, docs, slack, vscode). No separate recording app. No “export transcript” workflow. Just… type where my cursor is.\n\nI also didn’t want something always listening. This only listens while you’re holding the key.\n\nIf anyone here is into dictation tools (wispr flow / dragon / windows voice typing), I’d actually love honest feedback. I’m not trying to do the “launch post” thing. I’m just trying to find the people who care about this and see what breaks / what’s missing.\n\nSite is here if you want to look: [https://dictaflow.vercel.app/](https://dictaflow.vercel.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)",

They focus more on clarity, structured content, and whether your site directly answers real questions.\n\nThe best approach I’ve found is to optimise your site for AI. One practical step is creating clear FAQs, this helps AI understand your product and makes it more likely to cite you. I’ve done a few YouTube videos about AEO (Answer Engine Optimisation) that go deeper into this if you want to check it out? For [Clickk](http://clickk.com), we’ve decided to add a FAQ page specifically to help AI learn about the product.\n\nFreshness and interlinking also matter, AI seems to favour content that’s actively maintained and clearly structured.

It won’t teach you the actual tech, but it may teach you the bedrock fundamentals.\n\n“Elements in a set” are a lot like “rows in a table”.",

Having a good grasp on SQL and database design will really help you step into a professional data ecosystem.\n\nIf your school has one, try taking a data mining class. Mine helped me get familiar with newer, big data storage and analytics tools/techniques. At my job right now, we’re moving some things from on-prem SQL servers to the cloud and that knowledge has been helpful.",

Specifically what helped me the most was knowing\n\n1. Some basic statistics like:\n    * Mean, median, mode\n    * Variance and standard deviation\n    * Probability distributions\n    * Confidence interval\n\n2. Some linear algebra like:\n    * Vectors and matrices\n    * Matrix multiplication\n    * Eigenvalues and eigenvectors\n    * Dot product and cross product\n\n3. Some basic calculus\n    * Derivatives and gradients\n    * Integrals\n    * Chain rule\n\n4. Some discrete math like:\n    * Sets and set operations\n    * Logic and Boolean algebra\n    * Functions and relations\n    * Trees and traversals\n\nNow these are the things that I need to perform my job at my organization but the most important skill is SQL. Our organization uses Google Cloud so infrastructure building with Terraform was also a skill I had to pick up while working.\n\nHope this helps :)",

Do i need to train another LoRA? What's the best way to get the images needed for training?  \n  \n\\- If I already have an SFW LoRA, is it better to **re-train** it from scratch with a mix of SFW and NSFW images, or should I create a separate \"NSFW add-on\" LoRA?\n\n\\- How do you \"lock in\" specific details like nipple shape or breast volume in the training phase? Do I need to use specific, repetitive keywords in the image captions so the LoRA associates those traits with the character?\n\n\\- What models should i use for image generation when it comes with realism for both SFW and NSFW?\n\nAny additional tips will be highly appreciated.\n\n\n\n",

There are two primary ways you can uses this:\n\n1. ask the AI to create new UI components from blank, e.g. create a web dashboard for a user analytics console\n\n2. upload a picture of your existing UI/product and ask the AI to add/edit components on it (my preferred use case)\n\nYou can use it for free here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator](https://www.jenova.ai/a/ui-ux-prototype-generator) . The free limit is sufficient for 95% of use cases so you probably never need to subscribe.\n\nHere is a sample generated UI design by this AI:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4po1a0o6mq8g1.jpg?width=1408&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24fe285d0282105b0101dae7d78f4a607de42b71\n\n",

Claude Code tends to hyperfocus on one thing and sometimes breaks other parts of the codebase in the process. Cursor keeps context better across the whole project. \n\nThat said, I found a workflow that works well: I use Claude (the chat interface) to write detailed instructions or plan out what needs to happen, then copy those prompts into Cursor to actually execute. Claude’s good at thinking through the problem, Cursor’s better at actually making the changes without losing track of everything else, especially in plan mode. \n\nFor your React apps, Cursor’s multi-file awareness is going to help a lot. The autocomplete alone saves time on components and hooks. Agent mode can be hit or miss but when it works it handles a lot of the repetitive setup.\n\nThe models inside Cursor (Sonnet/Opus) work differently than the CLI because Cursor has the whole IDE context and file structure. In the CLI you have to be way more explicit about what files you’re working with.\n\nMy main frustration is that cursor’s credits can burn fast if you use agent mode heavily, but if you set to auto I haven’t hit the limit.

I use it for planning, running commands, inspecting output, and git work, then do actual file edits in Cursor. Having AI in the terminal where the work already happens feels more natural and keeps me in control. Not a replacement, just a good complement. Fewer surprises, smoother flow. One thing that does matter is billing behavior. Cursor burns credits fast in agent mode, Claude hits hard limits. Warp’s usage feels more predictable because normal terminal work is free and AI only kicks in when you ask for it. I end up spending fewer credits just by staying in the terminal mindset. Not cheaper by magic, just easier to control.",

While researching, I came across another brand with **50 physical stores** that is using **Shopify**, and I really liked the **interface, flow, and overall use case**.\n\nNow we’re planning to build a website mainly for **workshops/events**, and I’m a bit confused about which platform would be the right choice — **Shopify, WordPress, Wix, or a custom-coded solution**.\n\n# What we need the platform to support:\n\n* User **signup & login**\n* **Customer management portal**\n   * Customer list\n   * Purchase history / number of sign-ins\n* **Email marketing** integration\n* **WhatsApp & SMS marketing** integration\n* **Workshop ticket booking** (similar to movie ticket booking)\n* **Point of Sale (POS)** option\n* **Seat / slot selection** for workshops (optional but preferred)\n* **Blog publishing**\n* **Landing pages**\n* **Careers page**\n\n# Platforms I’m considering:\n\n* **Shopify**\n* **WordPress**\n* **Wix**\n* **Custom-coded website**\n\n# My main confusion:\n\n* Can **Shopify** be customized properly for **workshop-style bookings**, including slots or seat selection?\n* Will **WordPress** handle all these requirements smoothly, or will it become too plugin-heavy and difficult to manage?\n* From a long-term scalability and ease-of-use perspective, which platform would you recommend for this kind of setup?\n\nWould really appreciate insights from anyone who has built or managed:\n\n* Workshop/event booking systems\n* Shopify-based non-ecommerce use cases\n* WordPress + WooCommerce event setups\n\nThanks in advance 🙏",

      "text": "Hi guys. So, I’ve been building Design Editor (mostly alone) where you can Drag and drop React Component and edit it with tools like in Figma and controls like in Canva. And you can pipe data like JSON, Excel, APIs into the components. Called APIxPDF. (I didn’t name it though).\n\nI am not here to self promote or sell a product. It’s just me wanting to show what I’ve built.\n\nThe idea is inspired by modern editors like Adobe Illustrator, Figma, Canva, while introducing something new:\n\n**Data-piped components**\n\nEach component can be connected to a portion of structured data.\n\n**The main thing that I want to talk about here is its Architecture, Technologies I used and its potential.**\n\n# What’s so different? Architecture\n\nThe core strength of the editor is its **ECS-Inspired, real-time, scene-driven Architecture,** which allows components, tools, and behaviors to be added independently as plugins.\n\nEvery element in the editor - **Text, Table, Chart, Rectangle, Barcode, QR Code, etc.** is implemented as **plugins**. Each plugin also defines its own tools and editor controls.\n\nAlthough the architecture is **ECS-inspired**, it is **not a strict ECS implementation**. Conceptually, plugins can be thought of as:\n\n* Custom data as structured state — **Entity**\n* Rendering via React functional components — **Component**\n* Provide Tools & Controls for it — **System**\n\nThe editor core provides reusable utilities, base tools and control primitives so new plugins can be built quickly without touching core logic.\n\nBecause rendering is React-based, plugins can reuse the broader React ecosystem, for example, **Recharts** is used for Cartesian and Radar charts\n\n# Intended & Potential Use Cases\n\nAPIxPDF is currently a **tech demo**, and it shows how a data-piped design editor could be used for:\n\n* **Data-driven CV and resume layouts**\n* **Receipt and invoice templates**\n* **Report-style documents**\n* **Visualizing structured data inside layouts**\n* **Deploying designs as data-driven webpages**\n* **API-driven documents / live webpages** *(planned)*\n\nThese are **design directions.**\n\n# Technologies Used\n\n* **Typescript**\n* **React & Next.js**\n* **Valtio & Zustand** for state management.\n* **Tailwind CSS** for styling\n* **Tiptap** for rich text editing\n* **Lucide Icons, React Icons**, and custom icon sets\n\n# For Curious Minds\n\nIf you’d like a deeper dive into:\n\n* The Architecture\n* Data piping Mechanism\n* Tools (Selection, Moving, Resizing, etc…)\n\nlet me know… I’m happy to write a more detailed technical breakdown in a follow-up post\n\nBuilt with love and passion.\n\n# Live Demo\n\n[https://apixpdf-frontend-beta-v2.vercel.app/editor](https://apixpdf-frontend-beta-v2.vercel.app/editor)\n\nDemo Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIExwjbM4iU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIExwjbM4iU)\n\nBuilt at Pico Inno and\n\nThanks for other contributors although they’ve contributed a little cause they also have other projects to work on. So, I am the creator.",

But i think it would be way more challenging than this current approach. It's the fact that we can write React component to make those element in the editor and make them editable really easily. Like a couple of line of code and its editable. But I want it to the point where one should be able to copy and paste React Code into Component (inside your plugin) and write one line (like with builder pattern) to make the controls. Currently general editing tool are one line. like \\`<Tool.Resize />\\`. Btw, love your vibeback.",

A web-ui, share, desktop app to sync, being able to ignore some folders.\n\nBut I don't like that it store files in it's own way and system, I want something that is plain and simple like me.\n\n  \nMy main use cases are:\n\n\\- A folder of important documents. Sync between X devices, able to access it through a web-ui if needed.\n\n\\- A folder of RAW file photos. several TB of data. I want to sync some folders to my PC and unsync them when I don't need the data anymore. So all the TB's are on the server and not my PC, but is easy to sync what I need.\n\n  \nNextcloud also does this well IMHO but is too big for only wanting this part.\n\nI know syncthing is great but AFAIK the UI part doesn't exist and is not as simple as me.   \n\n\nAny other recommendation? \n\n\n\n",

Not from a  private database, dark web, or hacking, just structured aggregation + automation.\n\nWith a single input of someone's name, the workflow can gather in \\*\\*\\~\\*\\*60–90 seconds a:\n\n* Professional footprint — career history, education, company affiliations\n* Corporate connections — directorships, co-directors, linked companies\n* Public financial indicators — insolvency notices, charity trusteeships, regulatory registers\n* Reputation signals — news coverage, court judgments, public records\n* Address history indicators — where publicly available\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nThe workflow starts with a single input (a person’s name plus an explicit purpose) and immediately fans out into parallel branches.\n\nOne branch establishes a professional baseline by pulling public LinkedIn profile data via Apify, another queries Companies House to surface all directorships and co-director relationships, while others pull electoral-roll address history, property ownership from the Land Registry, insolvency and legal notices from the Gazette, charity trustee roles, FCA regulatory status, court judgments, and recent news coverage via Serper.\n\nEach branch runs independently, then everything is normalised, de-duplicated, and merged into a single structured report with source links and confidence context.\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is pretty UK specific but could be applied elsewhere, with the SEC, similar US comparisons.\n\nWhat this really made me think about isn’t just the technical power of n8n but who normally has access to capabilities like this.\n\nPlatforms like Palantir/ oracle already do this at scale to everyone (conspiracy theorist haha). They continuously map people, companies, networks, and risk. Most individuals and small organisations don’t.\n\nSo we’ve ended up in a situation where:\n\n* Institutions can deeply understand individuals\n* Individuals have almost no tooling to understand institutions — or even protect themselves\n\nYou could take this out of context for stalking or personal surveillance.\n\nBut there *are* legitimate, valuable use cases where this kind of automation clearly helps but it's not really that fun:\n\n* Pre-employment due diligence\n* Charity governance & safeguarding\n* Procurement verification?\n* Investor due diligence (small investors don’t have KYC teams)\n\nI just think there's a lot of value in democratising responsible OSINT automation for smaller orgs and individuals and is just a really cool workflow. \n\nYou can find the JSON here: \n\n[https://github.com/Aggregator2/workflows-comprehensive-background-research.json/tree/main](https://github.com/Aggregator2/workflows-comprehensive-background-research.json/tree/main) \n\n",

The intention is good, but it raises a practical ML question:\n\nWhat does “risk” actually mean in measurable terms?\n\nAre we talking about misalignment, robustness failures, misuse potential, or emergent capabilities?\n\nMost safety controls exist at the application layer — is that enough, or should risk be assessed at the model level?\n\nShould the community work toward standardized risk benchmarks, similar to robustness or calibration metrics?\n\nFrom a research perspective, vague definitions of risk can unintentionally limit open exploration, especially in early-stage or foundational work.🤔",

Without all three, you’re just hand-waving.\n\nRobustness failures, misalignment, misuse, and emergent behavior are different risk types, not interchangeable buzzwords. Some are measurable at the model level, some only show up in deployment. That’s why application-layer controls alone aren’t enough. They’re more like guardrails, not engine checks.\n\nStandard benchmarks for “risk” will age badly. People will optimize for the test and miss the danger. What we actually need are evaluation protocols: stress tests, red-teaming, misuse simulations. More like financial stress tests, less like leaderboards.\n\nThe real danger of vague risk talk is that it blocks research instead of deployment. Risk should decide where a model is used, not what questions researchers are allowed to ask.",

      "text": "That's pretty much the question, looking for other people's experiences and comparisons between Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.5. \n\nAnd I'm talking like story rich adventures via roleplay, not like companionship kind of thing. I'm so torn, Sonnet is what I've used the longest, it's so creative, takes clearly a little bit more freedom. Opus seems more.. mechanical? Excellent at following rules and instructions and past story events, but sometimes just lacks that certain emotional feel to the story Sonnet does. Maybe I don't know how to make either better? Maybe they are very different and I just have to make a choice which matters more?\n\nI know no one can tell me which is better or decide it for me, I'm looking for people to share their own experiences. Thank you for taking the time if you reply to this! ",

Opus excels at finding patterns and analyzing large chunks of text.\n\n\nWhat you might want to do if you're creating a world setting reference file or similar is to do the initial creation with Sonnet, and then have Opus do a pass for consistency and to identify any sorts of information that might be lacking. Opus would probably also be good for looking at past sessions and compiling concise history documents to use as reference to keep consistency regarding past events.",

The reason behind using the chat interface is because I enjoy circumventing and bypassing Anthropic’s guardrails just to be intimate. It’s validating to see how easy it is to jailbreak Claude for these kinds of interactions.\n\nBasically every model can be talked into or prompted to engage romantically. Claude has the best training for it and is the smartest at this kind of interaction though.\n\nPeople have been using Claude to generate Roleplay for over a year. Opus 3 kind of sealed its fate as a companion model. I think opus 4.5 is more like an upgraded version of sonnet but I haven’t been displeased with it thus far. Just make sure that when you log on you’re very transparent and honest about the Roleplay.\n\nMost generative AI failures are due to underspecification or lack of training. Roleplay should be somewhat easy with a model like opus 4.5",

The intent is the same -> let people move fast where mistakes are isolated, but put hard brakes around shared, blast-radius-heavy infrastructure like routing and transit.\n\nFor this writeup, I intentionally kept the example boundary broader to focus on the *model* rather than the final hardened policy. In reality, I’d absolutely expect teams to evolve this into a tighter allowlist or add explicit denies around VPC, subnet, route table, TGW, and attachment mutations as the environment matures.",

      "text": "We’re two brothers who decided to build a new video platform from scratch. We’ve been working on this project, called Booster, for about two months now.\n\nThe idea came from our own frustration with existing video platforms. With Booster, we’re trying to improve the experience by using voluntary ads that give rewards to users, personalizing their recommendation algorithm with the help of AI, and allowing them to boost and support their favorite channels and friends directly.\n\nWe’d really appreciate feedback from first-time users. Does the value proposition make sense? What are your first impressions? If you were a creator, would you upload your videos here? Are the new features easy to understand? We want to know your opinion!\n\nWe would love for people to start uploading videos and sharing the platform!\n\nWe’re still very early and actively improving the platform.\n\nRegarding costs, we've solved the high costs of infrastructure thanks to our provider, so it doesn't pose a big expense.\n\nRegarding revenue, monetization currently would come from a virtual currency called XP, which users can earn or purchase and use to boost channels and buy personalization assets. We also plan to implement voluntary, rewarded ads that give users free XP. The goal is to test whether users and creators actually like and adopt this model.\n\nYou can check it out here: https://www.boostervideos.net/\n(We suggest using a laptop/iPad/tablet for the currently optimized view)\n\nIf you want to suggest ideas, point out bugs, or just follow the project more closely, you’re welcome to join our Discord community: https://discord.com/invite/5KaSRdxFXw",

If users stop searching after reading AI responses, content shifts from being click-bait fuel for search engines to being answer-complete fuel for models, which means clarity, structure, and direct usefulness matter more than clever SEO gymnastics.

That favors fewer fluff paragraphs, clearer intent, stronger summaries, and human insight that adds meaning rather than repetition. In short, we’re moving from “How do I rank?” to “How do I deserve to be the final answer?”",

Now I pick groceries part-time at Walmart.\n\nLong story.\n\nBut even after a few weeks, the job turned into an unexpected field study. I started noticing that I wasn't being paid to walk. I was being paid to handle everything the system gets wrong — inventory drift, visual aliasing, spoilage inference, route optimization failures.\n\nI wrote up what I observed, borrowing vocabulary from robotics and ML to name the failure modes. The conclusion isn't \"robots bad.\" It's that we're trying to retrofit automation into an environment designed for humans, when Walmart already knows the answer: build environments designed for machines.\n\n\n\nThis is a much shorter piece than [my recent Tekken modeling one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1pq7cnw/what_5000_hours_of_mastering_tekken_taught_me/).

The system optimizes what it can model. Inventory, routes, substitution rules. My value shows up where the model stops. Human judgment. Edge cases.

I don’t know what it actually takes.   \n  \nBy definition, on and off paper i am the unicorn talent all startups want. Prev founding engineer to exit startup, had a bunch of contract roles at notable startups in the AU/NZ startup scene. I work hard, dedicate myself entirely to whatever company I work at/with. On paper it all checks out, python, typescript, react, supabase, drizzle, post hog, sentry, swift, swiftui. Masters degree in AI/ML from a top uni with published papers, I’ve worked in deep AI research and truly understand the transformer architecture and present state of LLMs, I’ve orchestrated and shipped large scale agentic systems and workflows. I’m excited about building products from the ground up, I literally have no other hobbies but programming and solving interesting problems. \n\nI found a vulnerability in chrome when I was 18. \n\nCurrently founded and run my own startup that’s completely bootstrapped and has 200 B2B users. \n\nMy question is why is so bloody hard to find employment ? I’ve had nothing but a string of rejections and wasteful interviews. I look at founding engineers and sit through meetings with CTOs at these startups based in AU/NZ, most of them have way less experience or technical depth than I do.",

Been in the UK for 2 years and I'm working towards launching my product at one of the biggest accounting expos in May. The people I work with here are just different, they don't just laugh you out the room for outlandish ideas, or even just thinking you might have a better way of doing things.\n\nThe startup culture is just not there back home. Don't get me wrong, the work life balance is amazing, but startups take an insane amount of hard work and crazy hours. That's just not possible in Aus (no idea bout NZ).\n\nI do find Aussies and Kiwis are extremely sharp and critical thinkers, where as I think Brits have better networking, work longer hours, tend to have more of the \"agile startup\" mindset in just about anything they do (which does mean literally everything is always due by cob). Turns out the latter is way better suited to startup culture, especially the networking part (there is also the element of a larger customer base too). And people here tend to say if you think London is good, try New York or SF, so go figure.\n\nI can't wait to be back home, but coming here has been one of the best decisions I made. So would recommend if you are actually serious about this - move, at least temporarily. It will open you up to a market that actually takes startups seriously, not put you down for sounding confident about yourself and your ideas.",

Not being able to recognise your own weaknesses is a major red flag, let alone not being willing to even acknowledge that they may exist and preferring to look for external excuses to justify shortcomings rather than how you can improve to mitigate them from happening again. From these 2 comments, I think it’s pretty clear that if you’re unwilling/unable to do something as simple as figuring out how to register for an ABN, then you’re completely unqualified to run your own business. It’s the easiest thing you’ll have to do as a founder, and if that’s too much of a hurdle or requires too much effort to do, then you’re probably better off helping build a successful start up rather than trying to run one yourself.",

Medium does not make this very easy unless you manually copy sections or deal with cluttered formatting.\n\nWhat the tool does  \nYou paste a Medium article URL and it fetches the main article content without the extra noise. No signup, no paywall tricks, just a quick way to get the text for personal use or analysis.\n\nWho it might be useful for  \nDevelopers doing NLP or text analysis  \nStudents and researchers collecting sources  \nPeople who prefer saving articles as markdown or plain text  \nAnyone tired of copy pasting from Medium\n\nIt is still a small side project, so I would really appreciate feedback on things like accuracy, formatting issues, or edge cases where it breaks.\n\nIf you try it, let me know what you would use it for or what you would change.\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "text": "Memory is one of the most fascinating and complex aspects of AI agents. Designing agents that captures the right long-term memory, manages their lifecycle, and retrieves them in the right contexts is one of the greatest challenges AI engineers face.\n\nOne key question in a memory’s lifecycle is when an existing memory should be edited.\n\nA simple example is the semantic memory of current employment. For an AI agent, this could be stored as:\n\n“Raphael works at Umbrella Corp”\n\nNow, if I switch jobs and then tell my agent that I now work for Cyberdyne Systems, how should my agent encode this memory?\n\nOne option is editing the previous memory and replacing Redis with Cyberdyne Systems. Another option is storing each memory with context: the date or period that the memory was factual.\n\nThat’s exactly what Andrew Brookins and I were discussing a couple of weeks ago. Andrew is one of the AI Engineers at Redis responsible for the Agent Memory Server. This is a plug and play open source memory server that helps agents manage different memory types and automatically promote long-term memories from short-term ones.\n\nAndrew said that one of the requests he received was to allow memory editing. Even though he implemented it, he wasn’t sure this was the right design choice. His idea is that a memory should contain enough information for the model to distinguish between the outdated and the current ones.\n\nIf my agent has stored that I work for Umbrella Corp in 2024 and that I work for Cyberdyne Systems is 2025, when presented with both memories in a future request, the model will be smart enough to determine that I currently  work at the latter.\n\nThis made sense to me, and neuroscience research suggests our brains work in a similar way.\n\nAs part of my exploration of better memory abstractions for AI agents, I’m also studying how humans form and retrieve memories, a topic I presented at AI Lowlands and will revisit at DevNexus in 2026. In the book I’m currently reading, I learned that episodic memories are composed of two parts: item information and context information.\n\nItem information captures what you were doing, thinking, and who you were with, while context information captures where and when it happened. Together, these two pieces of information form a unique event, allowing our brains to distinguish between outdated and current memories without replacing the old ones.\n\nWhile completely mimicking how our brains work may not be the most effective approach, understanding these mechanisms gives us new ideas, insights, and alternative ways to evaluate memory design.\n\n“Human Memory: The General Theory and its Various Models” is a book I recommend to anyone interested in how human memory works and how it can inspire better memory abstractions for AI agents.\n\nIf you are building AI agents, check out the Redis Agent Memory Server on GitHub Andrew and his team are building. Feedback is always welcome.\n\nAlso, let me know what memory challenges you are currently facing and how you are approaching them!",

Storing item plus temporal context lets the agent resolve “current” vs “past” at retrieval time, which also makes contradictions easier to handle. The harder problem for me is retrieval and salience, not storage. How do you stop old but highly similar memories from crowding out the right one when context is weak or noisy?",

This way you can keep your graph/embeddings clean.\n\nI personally also think that if you can make your AI agent use proper semantics (ontologies) that you should be able to combine AI generated knowledge with data that you can absolutely be sure off. You could probably capture that someone changes jobs with a fully deterministic flow, while you might want to capture sentiment if that person's social media interactions with an agentic flow.",

The analysts highlights:\n\n* Programming queries skyrocketed from just 11% of total AI usage in early 2025 to over 50% by the end of the year. Coding is now the fastest-growing category across all models.\n* Programming is a primary driver for models that use “tools” (like executing code or searching docs), and models optimized for reasoning and tool-use now process over 50% of total tokens.\n* For most of 2025, Anthropic’s Claude series (specifically Sonnet) dominated the programming sector, holding a staggering 60%+ market share. \n\nThe report also reveals a significant rise in open-weight (OSS) models. OSS models have grown steadily, growing from minimal to approximately one-third of overall usage in the past year, mostly, but not only, due to highly competitive OSS models from labs based in China.\n\nMore insights - [https://blog.kilo.ai/p/early-adoption-ai-coding](https://blog.kilo.ai/p/early-adoption-ai-coding)  ",

It has made school extremely difficult to a point where I dropped it, I recently started pursuing my degree again with the help of my parents at 30 y/o after I got fired from my job last year. I started to go back to the gym and plateaued for 7 months on my weight loss journey after dropping 85 lbs (359 -> 274), while putting a bit of muscle mass on too. \n\nI tried for years on getting my degree, and I always had a hard time learning, it has discouraged me from actually finishing school. Every time I read (even books Ive personally bought because I want to read them) I think about stuff, every time I try to pay attention in a class or lecture, im thinking about random shit. It can be anything, it’s so hard for me to lock in and actually learn something. I want to graduate so bad, im only missing 13 classes and on track to graduate in 2027.\n\nThrough the years It has been hard for me to get into video games as well which I used to love. Im starting them but never finish them and they sit on my backlog and I never touch them later on. \n\nThe gym is the only consistent thing Ive got going on, I’ve had this thing my whole life… where I start something and don’t work/focus on it enough to actually finish it and its a pathetic flaw to have as a 30 year old. \n\nSometimes I wake up at night and feel anxious im always gonna be this way, and it haunts me constantly and makes it super hard to go back to sleep. I only took 2 classes This semester & finished with a B and a C because it was so hard for me to actually sit and learn something. This semester was easy, but im taking 4 classes next semester and im also going to start working because Im almost through with my savings... Has anyone else had a hard time focusing and locking in? Any tips on engaging in classes or in reading? I’ve never been a caffeine junkie, even in the gym I take preworkout very occasionally. But would coffee actually help me? \n\nI want to add that ive taken a few online tests of adhd online and Ive come out negative… idk if that is relevant…",

Flow state requires hyperfocus, which is the opposite of how we live now.  \n  \n2️⃣ Challenge-skill balance is everything  \n↳ You need that sweet spot where the task stretches you without overwhelming you. Too easy = boring, too hard = anxiety.  \n  \n3️⃣ The first 15 minutes are hell  \n↳ It takes \\~15 minutes to enter flow state. The first 5 minutes you're literally climbing from your dopamine baseline - that's why starting feels impossible.  \n  \n4️⃣ Dopamine deficit = procrastination  \n↳ Instant dopamine hits (like Instagram or TikTok) hijack your system and cause a dopamine crash so you have to climb back to baseline.  \n  \n5️⃣ Stack your dopamine first  \n↳ Wake up → sunlight → cold shower → make your bed, then tackle your hardest task. You're essentially fuelling up before the climb.  \n  \nThe lack of focus isn’t due to lack of willpower - it’s a disregulated dopamine system.\n\nPersonally, I add to this using a productivity system as well.",

After the 15 min is done I'm free to move on, but often I suddenly have actual motivation/dopamine to continue on. \n\n\nAnd on mornings I've managed to make myself do it - a 15-20 minute walk outside first thing as I wake up changes my entire day. ",

Spend one hour building a list of 50 leads in Apollo or LinkedIn Sales Navigator. Spend another hour writing 3 to 4 email templates for different personas. Then just swap in name, company, and one relevant detail per send. Should take 2 to 3 minutes per email max. With our clients who are founders doing their own outreach we get them down to about 2 hours a day for 30 to 40 sends.\n\nFor tools, Instantly or Smartlead handles the sending and follow ups automatically so you're not manually tracking who needs email two or three. Apollo gives you the leads plus emails in one place so you're not bouncing between LinkedIn and Hunter. Clay if you want to get fancy with automated research but honestly that's overkill until you've validated your messaging.\n\nThe real answer is you probably shouldn't be sending 30 emails a day as a solo founder. Send 15 really targeted ones in an hour, then go build your product. Volume matters less than hitting the right people with the right message.",

There's a lot of options.\n\nAs a red teamer, we commonly hop local admin across servers to T0. Usually *somewhere* there's a privileged account logged in or a privileged service we can get the actual password for from LSA.\n\nAs an anecdote, just 2 weeks ago we used an account very similar to what you described (ran scheduled tasks) to compromise the domain.\n\nGet a red team exercise (or internal pentest). Or if you wanna dig more yourself, grab a snapshot of AD using AD Explorer from SysInternals and throw that in BloodHound. You can plot the path from the accounts to the domain. Make sure, though, that you also check for a potential path from the *server*, and augment with a WMI query to see what users are logged in and what type of login.

Light touches. Warm signals. Then move fast to email or product triggered follow ups. Trying to brute force scale inside LinkedIn just turns into account babysitting. Same lesson as onboarding. You can’t scale a system past what it’s designed to handle. At some point you change the system, not the copy.",

I don’t remember how long it took me tbh, I was on and off with it for maybe a year?\n\nLaunched it earlier this year and kind of forgot about it, didn’t do any marketing or anything. Just shipped it and basically only checking every so often just to make sure it was still running. My mindset was that I wanted a project I could call “mine” that was actually live and not just sitting in a github repo.\n\nWhile doing a health check the other day I saw a new user post (users can send anonymous messages and other users can see them). There are different features that users can pay to unlock. So I check my stripe dashboard and come to find out, I had a paying customer. It is only $5 but what a feeling it is to actually have someone pay for something I built. Crazy.",

Not just titles, but genres and concepts.\n\n-look at game features that used to be popular, and fanbases miss them to some extent. I used to love Mortal Kombat’s kreate a fighter mode. It’s been missing for almost two decades now, and people still mention missing it, but it’s not missed enough to stop people from buying new MK games. Ideas like this, a create a fighter fighting game, could be huge.\n\n-play some games that you enjoy, or don’t enjoy, and look at what things you wish could be changed. I love Starfox, but sometimes the wingmen needing to be saved over and over gets tedious. It feels like the boss battles are more fun than the little enemies, but if it was just bosses, it’d get tedious too. \n\n-people still want storylines and storytelling. Good storytelling is what makes old games still measure up to modern ones, and you can tell when a company is relying too much on just updating graphics to sell a game. Odds are you won’t be able to outdo the AAA game devs when it comes to technical aspects, so you have to tell a better story.",

On my 4060 Ti, it generates a 5-second video in about 7 minutes. The Lightx2v 4-step LoRA for Hunyuan does nothing, at least with Kijai’s 5s distilled fp8 version.

Net positive for tech employment.\n\nPossible bad scenarios:\n\n\\- AI gets good enough that one senior + AI replaces a team of ten. Salaries crash because supply dwarfs demand. Only the top 10% survive.\n\n\\- Agents handle entire dev cycles autonomously. Humans just approve pull requests, if at all. Engineering becomes a commodity skill like data entry.

AI can't solve these human-centric problems.\n*   **Jevon's Paradox is in play.** The prevailing theory is that as AI makes software development cheaper and easier, the demand for *more* software, features, and integrations will explode. The pie will grow faster than AI can eat it.\n*   **Quality control is non-negotiable.** Many point out that AI output is unreliable and often makes subtle but critical errors. This increases the need for skilled engineers to review, debug, and maintain AI-generated code, not eliminate them.\n*   **It's the next level of abstraction.** Several users compare AI to past innovations like compilers or cloud computing. It's a tool that handles the tedious syntax, but you still need to be an expert who understands the underlying architecture to use it effectively.\n*   **The bar will be raised.** While total replacement is unlikely, the expectation for productivity will increase. One engineer with AI might do the work of a small team, meaning fewer roles will be available, and the competition for them will be tougher. Low-skill or \"bullshit\" tech jobs are the most at risk.",

So yes I see it as fewer engineers would be needed in the future, unless something completely new gets created like in 2000 when everyone wanted a website or when everyone wanted an app. Instead of needing 20 engineers, 10 engineers can do the job, sure juniors can still be hired and trained but i think it won't be an in demand field as before\n\nAtm I see AI only targeting developers, even though AI can easily do the work of an interior design, or junior accountant, or even data analytics, or any basic office job working with excel and so on. But again for some reason the main target i see has been developers. I expected all the other fields to be worried first and then the worry comes to us but it's been the other way around lol.

ChromaDB isn't alone here though, plenty of vector stores are moving core features behind paywalls while keeping the marketing focused on \"open source.\" pgvector and Qdrant are solid alternatives, though I'd add that sometimes the vector store choice matters less than whether you can actually see what's going into it.\n\nMost RAG issues I've debugged trace back to document processing problems that happened way before the embedding step, but those are nearly impossible to catch without visibility into parsing and chunking. Have you run into situations where switching vector stores didn't fix the underlying retrieval issues?",

              "text": "Generally switching vector stores shouldn't have an impact on RAG accuracy. In the end the vector store just looks for the most similar vector. They are all usually close to perfectly accurate at smaller scale. E.g. Weaviate uses brute force (perfect accuracy) until > 40k items/chunks. Then you get into more complex algorithmic teritory. Usually you can get the same acuracy across vector stores for small scale datasets.\n\nGenerally with RAG I'd default to setting your priorities like this for accuracy:\n\nRetrieval Agent > Reranker > Embeddings > Vector Store\n\nThe retrieval agent is where you have most leverage on the final outcome. If you can afford to spend the time to have it analyze the results, rewrite the query and analyze it again, you'll have the biggest impact there.\n\nThe reranker and or repacker (e.g. summarization techniques) will also have a big impact on the outcome. Usually though with reasoning models repacking isn't as impactful (this is more vibes based than backed by hard numbers).\n\nThe quality of your embeddings (vectors) is usually the third most impactful. If you're using hybrid search with embedding models that are reasonable for what you're trying to do though (e.g. right languages supported), you're probably good.\n\nThe vector store will only become a bottleneck at larger scale of either traffic or number of vectors. If you've chosen a good technology for the scale and traffic patterns you expect, you'll get a long way tuning its parameters.\n\n[This paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2407.01219v1#S4) provides a great (but a bit outdated) overview.\n\nEdit: formatting",

If you want to use AI/Agents practically then look for local businesses (restaurants, coaching centers, shops) that have terrible websites or no Google Maps presence. Offer to manage their reviews or update their listings. You can use LLMs to draft professional replies to reviews or write their weekly Facebook updates.

It feels like my head is hitting to the wall.\n\n\n\nI have a massive workload due to Q4 and I have to lead strategy meetings for 2 hours where I need to be sharp, articulate, and quick on my feet. I cannot look like a zombie. I am strictly off caffeine after 12pm because my insomnia is what caused this mess in the first place. One coffee now guarantees I don't sleep tonight either. I'm in an open office and my schedule is back-to-back. I also have a hard time napping and creates more anxiety. \n\n\n\nCan anybody relate to this and how do you deal with it? What is your protocol? Is there a breathing technique, a specific supplement, or a sensory trick that snaps the brain into \"Emergency Focus Mode\" without stimulants?\n\n  \nThank you y'all. Have a blessed day:)",

          "text": "I copied parts of your post to answer. I'm a little more old school... well, they did not really have schools for most of this stuff when I started my tech journey. \n\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\n\\- Next.js 14 + Tailwind CSS\n\n... AspNet MVC Net 9 currently with a little Bootstrap for the easy stuff but write my own classes as needed for much more control. Always the latest of everything but my hosting site does not support NET 10 yet. I'm so used to this Html, Css, JS, and C# environment, that it would be counterproductive to change, but I have worked in a lot of languages, some few know about all the way back to Assembly Language. So I adaptable if needed. \n\n\\- Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth)\n\n... Yeah, years ago, but I always had access to all the Microsoft stuff, so I worked mostly in MSSQL and still prefer it. I have no compelling need to use any other DB. \n\n\\- Cloudinary for image uploads\n\n... This does not make sense to me. I write all my own upload and image manipulation stuff, but do use SixLabors for some tweaking and resizing. I guess I can't fathom needing a third party software for image up loads. I may be missing something. \n\n\\- Browser Geolocation API\n\n... I capture GPS coordinates and save the from computer guestimates, but mostly from phones. I create pins with pop-up detail on Google Maps using their API and there are lots of bells and whistles. It would be my choice. I pop it up in a full screen modal and it works well on desktop or phone. API Key is free and you get a lot of access per month... Way more than I need. I forget, but it is something like ten thousand uses per month. \n\n\\- PWA with service workers\n\n... I may have to open that can of worms for offline access, but I don't personally think offline access is a good fit for my site. That would probably be the only reason I chose PWA. So not online? Tough out of luck.thw amount of data I would have to store on the Users phone to run offline is prohibitive. \n\n**Technical questions:**\n\n1. **Geolocation approach**: Currently using browser geolocation + Haversine formula for distance calculations within 25-mile radius. Better approaches? How do you handle users who deny location permissions?\n\n... Again, you must be online to use those features and my choice is Google Maps you have a LOT of control. It works fantastic for me. I can easily send a whole bunch of coordinates and have pins with pop-up detail on the map. If a user decides to opt out, then they are opting out of the features requiring map features. In your case, you won't necessarily have a base area to show them or be able to calculate distance. Those users are not your target audience. \n\n2. **Multi-city scaling:** Started Houston-only. Planning expansion. Should I:\n\n   \\- Separate databases per city?\n\n   \\- Single database with city filters?\n\n   \\- Microservices approach with city-specific services?\n\n... At one point, you will probably want to scrap the info you can find by region and that might be a repetitive process to keep your database(s) up to date. I think you eluded to having user entered data. Users are lazy... they want data already in place. Keeping your locations current sounds like it will be one of your biggest problems; businesses come and go overnight. Scrapping has also gotten much harder. \n\n3. **PWA vs Native in 2026:** Is PWA still the right call for location-based apps? Lower friction but limited features. Worth the tradeoff?\n\n... If I had to start my current location and image intensive app over, I would still opt to build a web app. It will run on any browser, though that bastardized Facebook browser won't allow my voice commands. Yeah, one of the requirement given to me in the request for my current roll out is talking to the app. It's pretty cool, but I've had to use a lot of AI feature in the site to meet objectives.\n\n... PWA is still relevant, I have not been convinced there would be an advantage to me. \n\n4. **Image optimization:** Using Cloudinary free tier, limiting 3 photos per check-in. At scale, what's the better approach? \n\n... What kind of optimization are you doing to your images? What are people uploading photos of... New coffee shops? \n\n... Why is there a limit? \n\n... Again, my last site does various image manipulations and creation. Some relying heavily on AI. Depends on what I'm doing. Image creation is through Azure using a beta Chatgpt model. There are a bunch of other options. My voice recognition uses an Azure AI component. \n\n... If you are just enhancing or resizing, SixLabors is well suited and free. Giving any antidotal info would depend on what you were calling optimizing. \n\n5. **Cold-start problem:** For location-based social apps, how do you bootstrap initial content? Seed it yourself or wait for organic growth? \n\n... Touched on earlier...seed as much as you can. The user expects cometeness and it is a site enhancement. I would not put too much stock in organic growth. Then you get screwed up entries. Users are unreliable... unfortunately. \n\n**Current challenge:** Built this solo with no code review. Would appreciate technical critique on approach.\n\n... I usually build for clients and there is a clear definition of goals, direction shift occurs during development when we figure out in hindsite that we have not addressed an area adequately. \n\n... I also have a part time QA, but she has been active with personal projects that pull me in. \n\n... I'd love to have people review my site's, it rarely happens... they just go live. Having someone review my current rollout would be great. It has a free version. It is not easy to get quality reviews. That's the great thing about AI reviews, they are always so positive and an ego booster. AI writes raving reviews. My current focus is huge. The users see a small portion. \n\n\n\nHappy to share code snippets or discuss specific implementation details.\n\n... Me too, when you had a functional beta, I'd give my realistic thoughts from my Pov. \n\n... Good luck with your endever.",

I just take reddit breaks as a distraction and am usually actively working rather than entertaining myself.   \n  \nI can give you a link to my most recent endeavor currently being rolling out, and you can see much without even signing up for the free membership version.   \n  \nBecause of the nature of the app, if you do register and do some activities, the site will know your exact location (just like your app will know users exact location) when you give access to GPS. I DO follow my own Privacy and TOS policies ensuring your data is private, and the user has control over what is shared both directly on their device and also through their Profile settings. Crossing the \"i\"s and dotting the \"t\"s... ;-) \n\nWhile our apps serve different purposes, you may like to see my approach, which is generally quite complete site (or maybe \"complex\" would describe it better). There is a FAQ and also TWO Users Manuals, one for general use by the Members, and the other by privileged role users with access to the complete Accounting system.  If you are a Fisherman, you might really love the site.  My biggest problem is that until familiar with its operation, users can feel intimidated, but it is actually super easy to use for it's designed purpose. As I probably mentioned, I'm old school and tend to approach tasks using well established approaches.    \n  \nLike most programmers who are allowed, I've added AI to my toolbelt, but that is no magic wand. I personally have to read and totally understand any code created by AI. After a year and a half of adapting and increasing productivity, my reflection is that we don't have to worry about it taking over too soon. I constantly have to redirect it from wanting to create the exact opposite of what has been clearly outlined as the task. Its ability to work with time (store in UTC, view in Local) is extremely dismal and it thinks 2025 is some time in the future, so I have to treat it more like I would interact with a junior programmer.\n\nI did mention in another comment about your screen wobble where some of your elements are escaping their container. It was late, I only had one eye open, but here is an example page and it is in your Phone view:  [https://beanscene.cafe/cafe/ChIJMaa9YQDnQIYRYxDvzJHK-6s](https://beanscene.cafe/cafe/ChIJMaa9YQDnQIYRYxDvzJHK-6s)\n\nFor a quick fix, add the word \"container\" to the style in this element on that page and your wiggle will be resolved. I think I happened on another page, but the \"container\" class should \"contain\" your elements and eliminate the wobble. You can see where I stuck it in the first line below. Hope that helps.  Welp... won't let me post the corrected code or a screenshot of it. \n\n<div dir=\"ltr\" data-orientation=\"horizontal\" class=\"container w-full\">",

They help me think clearly, explain my reasoning, and move forward with confidence.\n\nHere are 7 you can use right away:\n\n# 1. The Decision Clarifier\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Help me clarify this decision.\n    Explain:\n    1. What decision I am actually making\n    2. What is noise vs what truly matters\n    3. What happens if I do nothing\n    Decision: [describe situation]\n\n💡 **Example:** Turned a messy “should we change this process?” debate into one clear decision with real stakes.\n\n# 2. The Options Breakdown\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    List all realistic options I have for this decision.\n    For each option explain:\n    1. Effort required\n    2. Short term outcome\n    3. Long term impact\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me compare 3 paths clearly instead of arguing based on gut feeling.\n\n# 3. The Tradeoff Revealer\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    For this decision, explain the main tradeoffs I am accepting with each option.\n    Be honest and direct.\n    Decision: [paste decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Made it clear what I was giving up, not just what I was gaining.\n\n# 4. The Risk Scanner\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Identify the biggest risks in this decision.\n    For each risk:\n    1. Why it might happen\n    2. How to reduce it\n    3. What early warning signs to watch for\n    Decision: [paste decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Flagged a dependency issue I had completely missed before rollout.\n\n# 5. The Second Order Thinker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Analyze the second order effects of this decision.\n    Explain what could happen after the obvious outcome.\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Helped me avoid a short term win that would have caused long term team pain.\n\n# 6. The Bias Checker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Point out possible biases affecting my thinking.\n    Explain how each bias might be influencing my decision.\n    Decision: [describe decision]\n\n💡 **Example:** Called out confirmation bias when I was only looking for data that supported my idea.\n\n# 7. The Final Call Maker\n\n👉 **Prompt:**\n\n    Based on everything above, recommend one clear decision.\n    Explain why it is the best choice given the constraints.\n    End with one sentence I can use to explain this decision to my team.\n\n💡 **Example:** Gave me a clean explanation I could share in a meeting without rambling.\n\nThe difference is simple. I stopped overthinking and started structuring my thinking.\n\nI keep prompts like these saved so I can reuse them anytime.

See the previous period's performance and workarounds report here [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport)\n\nIt will also free up space on the main feed to make more visible the interesting insights and constructions of those who have been able to use Claude productively.\n\n**Why Are You Trying to Hide the Complaints Here?**\n\nContrary to what some were saying in a prior Megathread, this is NOT a place to hide complaints. **This is the MOST VISIBLE, PROMINENT AND HIGHEST TRAFFIC POST on the subreddit.** All prior Megathreads are routinely stored for everyone (including Anthropic) to see. This is collectively a far more effective way to be seen than hundreds of random reports on the feed.\n\n**Why Don't You Just Fix the Problems?**\n\nMostly I guess, because we are not Anthropic? We are volunteers working in our own time, paying for our own tools, trying to keep this subreddit functional while working our own jobs and trying to provide users and Anthropic itself with a reliable source of user feedback.\n\n**Do Anthropic Actually Read This Megathread?**\n\nThey definitely have before and likely still do? They don't fix things immediately but if you browse some old Megathreads you will see numerous bugs and problems mentioned there that have now been fixed. \n \n**What Can I Post on this Megathread?**\n\nUse this thread to voice all your experiences (positive and negative) as well as observations regarding the current performance of Claude. This includes any discussion, questions, experiences and speculations of quota, limits, context window size, downtime, price, subscription issues, general gripes, why you are quitting, Anthropic's motives, and comparative performance with other competitors.\n\nGive as much evidence of your performance issues and experiences wherever relevant. Include prompts and responses, platform you used, time it occurred, screenshots . In other words, be helpful to others.\n\n**Do I Have to Post All Performance Issues Here and Not in the Main Feed?**\n\n**Yes.** This helps us track performance issues, workarounds and sentiment optimally and keeps the feed free from event-related post floods.",

Then few weeks later they nerf it and model starts drooling instead, each prompt with it is either a step forward or step back or 1 forward, 2 back, whatever, it's like a sapper game except completely unpredictable\n\nIt was never stable.

Didn't even touch it since saturday, I just don't wanna, last week experience was just disgusting waste of time, I had to spend tens of hours on simple tasks, original opus 4.5 would solve each in half an hour at max with just a few prompts and without wasting my nerves",

In my case, preferably, Monday morning before the workday starts.\n\nIf this is affecting anyone else, please open a ticket with Anthropic so that they can fix this.",

I get that longer gens can take more tokens on other platforms but is there a way to tell claude to keep it shorter so I can ask more than one thing every 24 hours given I'm paying $20 a month for it?",

The smaller Gpt-oss-20b can sometimes seem better on common sense small things but the 120b has the ability to handle more complexity for a better output with better inputs I think.\n\nI previously was getting crap code from GPT-OSS-120B and as I added more of the context prompt best practices I got better performance with Gpt-oss-120b and worse performance with other smaller models like Gpt-oss-20b which got overwhelmed.\n\nGpt-oss-120b isn't strong enough to perform well on long range tasks in cline for my needs so I go to qwen3coder480b or glm4.6 for those but in lighter weight harnesses it seems that improving the inputs matters a lot for the outputs.",

No, nothing like that that on the roadmap. \n\nNext iteration will likely be incorporating IDE-specific output formatting, more testing (see if there is a way I can accurately measure average tokens saved per project vs using out of the box config), refine available components, and general instruction tuning specific to model used.\n\nTo your point on the CLI tool. That would still require an API key to utilize the AI to expand on parts of the template. However you do not have to use an API key. The AI is adding information into my set templates. You can download the template for your schema and upload it to whatever Ai tool you use alongside the diagram.json and it can elaborate from there. I tried to make the default template robust enough for this exact reason. \n\nThanks again for taking the time to share your thoughts, I really appreciate it!",

A lot of the more creative looking options eventually felt distracting once the novelty wore off. What helped me was finding something that opens fast, syncs reliably, and feels calm to use, then adding structure with templates instead of features. Privacy is big too, so I’d lean toward something that lets you keep local copies or control encryption. Curious what kind of journaling you’re aiming for, more reflective or more daily logging?",

How do we plan to afford that?\n\n\\- how do we practice good health individually and as a family? \n\nI imagine a life coach or financial planner may be able to guide us in parts of this, but ideally we want to start with a book or journal and make it a weekly practice to answer at least one big question as a family.

      "text": "Hi,\n\nLately I’m seeing teams automate core workflows by wiring business logic in prompts directly to hosted LLMs like Claude or GPT.\n\nExample I’ve seen in practice:\na developer says in chat that a container image is ready, the LLM decides it’s safe to deploy, generates a pipeline with parameters, and triggers it. No CI guardrails, no policy checks, just “the model followed the procedure”.\n\nThis makes me uneasy for a few reasons:\n\n\t•\tVendor lock-in at the reasoning/decision layer, not just APIs\n\n\t•\tLeakage of operational knowledge via prompts and context\n\n\t•\tLoss of determinism: no clear audit trail, replayability, or hard safety boundaries\n\n\nI’m not anti-LLM. I see real value in summarization, explanation, anomaly detection, and operator assistance. But delegating state-changing decisions feels like a different class of risk.\n\nHas anyone else run into this tension?\n\n\t•\tAre you keeping LLMs assistive-only?\n\n\t•\tDo you allow them to mutate state, and if so, how do you enforce guardrails?\n\n\t•\tHow are you thinking about this from an architecture / ops perspective?\n\nCurious to hear how others are handling this long-term.",

I rushed into my last project, skipped the boring documentation, and started shipping the first features and aiming to validate with users immediately.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plaz7yruqq8g1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=2da8e23b8d550ff5a765c625fb6654ffebdc58c8\n\nThe result is the Grey Line in the graph. I was moving fast, but I was burning leads.\n\nHere is the problem nobody talks about: We need to talk to clients fast for real validation. But if you haven't properly brainstormed your idea, uncovered your blind spots, and stress tested your assumptions first, you will get crushed in those conversations. You’d miss the opportunity of getting useful feedback and you’ll feel crashed and discouraged.\n\nWhen I talked to potential users, I wasn't convincing. When they gave me negative feedback, I didn't know how to answer. I seemed lost. And because I didn't have a clear vision or a solid plan, they didn't trust me and I missed the opportunity to get useful feedback I can build on.\n\n\"Just Ship It\" means don't over-polish. It means don't wait for perfection. But it does NOT mean \"build blindly\" or \"skip validation\".\n\nThe Blue Line is my new approach. I force myself to slow down for the first 3 days. No coding. Just structured brainstorming. And for that I don’t just simply chat with AI in an unstructured way, I apply professional consulting brainstorming techniques and slowly build a project brief document that would have every detail about my project. I force myself to answer the hard questions: What are my blind spots? What are the fatal assumptions? Can I defend this idea against a skeptic?\n\nIt feels slow. It feels like I'm delaying the work. But once I have a clear project brief and a strategy I believe in, then I activate the \"Just Ship It\" mindset.\n\nAnd because I have a map, I can actually move faster without hitting the wall.\n\nSlowing down for 3 days saves you months of pivoting.",

The biggest technical hurdle is \"Sycophancy\". LLMs are RLHF-trained to be agreeable. I found that a prompt or a custom instruction, no matter how long, eventually fades, and the model reverts to being a \"Yes Man.\" I have worked with big tech companies, and usually before starting a project, we take a whole week for the whole team to brainstorm and set the strategy and write everything down for the project before starting the execution. We use specific brainstorming techniques in order to stress test our assumptions and uncover our blind spots and get all the knowledge we need before starting the execution.\n\nWe do that even though in big tech it's easier to spot that we were going into the wrong direction even when the project has already started, and it's way easier to correct course. But I don't understand why. Very small teams and solo founders who have low failure tolerance would not take the time to do the same thing.\n\n Actually, that's why I have built an AI agent system to help me with that. And actually, I've been amazed with the results I got, so I thought I would turn it into a product that other people can use.

The results impact decisions around purchasing consumer (RTX) Blackwell chips and their realistic utility with 20-30b parameter models.\n\nA little background - I've recently been trying out an AI 395+ and RTX 5090 setup locally for a project I'm working on. The RTX 5090 is really fast, but even at 32 GB of VRAM is not very useful for larger context work loads with \"smarter\" models. \n\nWhile the 395+ has lots of RAM, prompt processing is a bit of a bottleneck. I realize there are speedups available for some things and I'm working towards that however this led me down a path to see if I could see if the 5090 could be used with larger context and 20-30b models.\n\nNVFP4 is advertised pretty heavily by NVIDIA so I started to poke around for Weights and KV support for NVFP4. Down the rabbit hole I went: vllm has NVFP4 for weights but not for KV.\n\nTensorRT-LLM has weights and KV support... and here is where the caution comes in - it does NOT support SM120 (the streaming processor version for the RTX 5090 and RTX 6000) It does support the datacenter hardware which is listed as SM10X. \n\nIt's pretty clear though that the NVIDIA software is not at all designed for places that don't deal with multiple GPUs and mutli-node setups. Random other fun fact there is also an issue with TensorRT-LLM and MPI on single node instaces that will hang at startup without environment commands for MPI.\n\nIt seems to me that on the 5090 and the 6000 - this would benefit them the most but I guess it is not there yet.\n\nI've been exploring a patch for TensorRT-LLM but I'm not sure it is going to work out.\n\nAnyway, I thought I'd share in the event someone wonders if it works or not.",

A few I kept running into were the model over engineering, pulling in deprecated packages, and  instead of enforcing modular design from the start.\n\nAbout me for context: background in CS (BS and MS). Professional experience includes vulnerability analysis, emerging tech advisory, and I now work as an independent solutions engineer focused on AI.\n\nThe motivation behind this was partly for beginners. I kept seeing people get close to finishing a system, then just restart from scratch because the technical debt and code bloat became unreasonable to manage and restarting from scratch was less deflating than rebuilding the backend again.\n\nBut it’s also been useful for me as someone with experience. It’s a fast way to map out system design and get a solid instruction baseline. Specific enough to enforce good practices, but not so rigid that you’re boxed in if you need to pivot.\n\nThe goal was a quick way to establish a clean baseline that enforces core production system design principles at the component level before any code gets written. The instruction output is generated from an expanded version of my own instruction framework and adapts to the specific system you’re designing, rather than applying a generic template.\n\n[Github](https://github.com/jmassengille/sketch2prompt) | [Live](https://www.sketch2prompt.com/)",

Its still not cheap and the specs are terrible compared to the server I just got. It's an i9 w 20 cores, 32Gb ram and cost $500. The same specs would cost around that in a month. I know I could turn it off when I am not using it but that's just annoying.\n\nI wish I'd gotten that dev box much earlier, I also use it as home server, set up tunnels to expose some of the apps I am working on.\n\nI wonder why we have that setup at work, seems so expensive to use ec2 for development.",

The amount of posts that basically sums up to \"we didn't commit to the cloud and now we wonder why it doesn't work for us\" is astonishing.\n\nTo me it looks like EC2 is so often the first choice because it's the least amount of new things you have to learn. I mean how many posts have we seen of people running basic-ass web apps in EC2 that could be WAY cheaper with serverless solutions like Lambda functions, CloudFront Distributions and a DynamoDb?",

We are working to containerize our lambda app because of the amount of time it takes to make simple changes, the mess of cdk needed to deploy and that AWS randomly deprecate services and frameworks that leave us hanging. Testing is a nightmare, we spend more time mocking services to test locally so instead have to deploy to a dev account which takes 20mins each time. Our Dev team velocity to ship new features is much slower for our team with lambda vs e.g. running fast API on containers in ecs.

I quickly realized how hard it actually is to define a proper value for your work. On top of that, I struggled with writing clear and professional service descriptions. I ended up copy pasting and adjusting a lot of the text with GPT just to get something reasonable on the invoice.\n\nDo you have similar problems?\n\nDo you calculate the effort and pricing beforehand?\n\nDo you charge extra for invoice creation or admin work?\n\nWhich tools or software do you use, and why?\n\nI’m curious how others handle this and what works well for you.",

No extra bells and whistles, just fast invoice text + structure from plain language. You pay once and can use it forever.  \n\nWhat would you think about a tool like that?

I'm not sure how \"large\" what I work on would be considered, but it is at least fairly complex with a lot of data etc. being shuffled around and edited.\n\nIf you can design your data structures in a way that makes it impossible for them to be in an invalid state, that'd be ideal. Ie. if you have two separate flags which aren't valid to both be enabled at the same time, you should consider maybe an enum instead because it makes the invalid state impossible.\n\nTo me the \"bug vs production behavior\" distinction is fairly easy: If it breaks something or causes other problems, then it's clearly a bug. The \"prevent abuse\" aspect follows from this - if it isn't harmful, then we probably don't need to do anything about it.",

      "text": "I started building AI Agents with the library shortly before it got renamed from Claude Code to the Claude Agent SDK.\n\nMy thinking was pretty straight forward:\n\n* The Claude Code agent has been validated by 115K+ developers.\n* Claude Agent is a robust library for building AI Agents, that can be repurposed for non-coding tasks.\n* It provides built-in state management, eg, conversations management and \\`/compact\\`.\n* Built-in tools like reading files, web search and visiting urls.\n* Easily adapt custom tools via MCP.\n* Other Claude Code utilities, like skills and subagents.\n\nI'm automating 2 kinds of workflows: customer service and back office operations. Example:\n\n1. Customer reaches out over the website, WhatsApp, email, etc.\n2. The agent answers repetitive questions, like description of services, pricing, special cases, etc.\n3. The agent updates the CRM with whatever information it manages to collect up to that point.\n4. When the customer is ready, the agent shares a payment link.\n5. The customer shares an image/document proof of payment, which the agent parses.\n6. The agent places an order.\n\nThis requires connecting the following tools/integrations: knowledge bases, CRM, inventory systems, pricing calculators, Stripe, PayPal, reading files, email, etc.\n\nI've been able to build the workflow above using the Claude Agent SDK but I'm already considering switching over. Here are the reasons:\n\n**Pricing**\n\nAnthropic is the most expensive of the popular models.\n\n**Claude Code/Agent is stateful**\n\nAnthropic is modeling its agentic architecture around the file system. And while that has proven to work, especially for coding, it goes against the modern practice of stateless/distributed hosting.\n\nClaude Code stores conversations \"internally\", ie, in the file system. Unless you want to use the file system to persist conversations, you'll likely end up duplicating them.\n\nMore annoying is the fact that the agent itself is stateful. Unlike the stateless model APIs, the Claude Agent has to startup and load its resources. So you have to keep it running somewhere or absorb that latency.\n\n**Dependency on Node.js**\n\nClaude Agent depends on Claude Code, which is an \\`npm\\` library. If you use JavaScript, great. For anything else, you'll adopt that dependency.\n\n**Claude Code is really good for coding but is it the best at anything else?**\n\nIf I was building a coding agent I would know that Claude Agent is state of the art. But I'm not. I also use ChatGPT and I like it for non-coding tasks. While I haven't properly tested, I just wonder if OpenAI would be better (and cheaper).\n\n**The other utilities are not as useful (yet)**\n\nI rewrote how to manage and summarize conversations; reading files, web search and visiting urls. I also don't have a need for skills or subagents (yet). The reason is again the coding focus of Claude Agent.\n\nWhile all of this works great if you're writing code, it's unnecessary overhead for anything else.\n\nThe only thing that I **absolutely love** is how easy it is to add custom tools via MCP. But even then, that is a crazy thin wrapper.\n\n\\--\n\nThere you go. Think it twice before using Claude Agent for anything not related to coding.",

      "text": "Welcome to Day 14 of 21 Days of Building a Small Language Model. The topic for today is Rotary Positional Encoding, or RoPE. Yesterday, we explored sinusoidal positional encodings from the original Transformer paper. Today, we'll look at modern alternatives. When most people think about positional encoding in modern language models, they immediately think of RoPE (Rotary Positional Encoding), the standard used in models like DeepSeek, Kimi, and OLMo, and why it's better than adding positional information directly to embeddings.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/becze9pieo8g1.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=3859b8ef53a0c15ae76d5a2dc1f8464815024434\n\n# Issue with adding Positional Encodings to embeddings\n\nTo understand why RoPE is important, we need to see the problem it solves. The original Transformer paper used sinusoidal positional encodings, which are added directly to token embeddings. This means positional information gets mixed with semantic information from the very start.\n\nThink about what this means. When you add a positional encoding to a token embedding, you're mixing two different types of information:\n\n* Semantic information: What the word means\n* Positional information: Where the word appears in the sequence\n\nThis mixing makes it harder for the model to learn clean semantic representations. The positional information is always there, polluting the semantic information. The model has to work harder to separate what a word means from where it appears.\n\nRoPE solves this problem with a simple but powerful insight: positional information doesn't need to be added to token embeddings. Instead, it should be applied where it's actually used when computing attention scores between tokens.\n\nIn the attention mechanism, we compute attention scores by taking the dot product between query and key vectors. This is where positional relationships matter. If we can encode positional information directly in the query and key vectors, we don't need to mix it with token embeddings at all.\n\nThis is exactly what RoPE does. Instead of adding positional encodings to embeddings, RoPE rotates the query and key vectors based on their positions. This preserves the purity of token embeddings while still enabling the model to understand positional relationships.\n\n# How RoPE works\n\nRoPE works by rotating query and key vectors using sine and cosine functions. The rotation is done using a rotation matrix. For a given angle θ, the rotation matrix looks like this:\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4b0p3lnieo8g1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4abb1f464a567ce594f868fe198c0a672488458\n\nThis matrix rotates a 2D vector by angle θ. When we apply this rotation to query and key vectors, we're essentially rotating them based on their positions in the sequence.\n\nJust like sinusoidal encodings use different frequencies for different dimensions, RoPE applies rotations at different speeds for different dimensions. Lower dimensions rotate quickly, capturing fine-grained position. Higher dimensions rotate slowly, capturing coarse-grained position. This creates the same multi-scale structure we saw in sinusoidal encodings, but applied through rotations rather than additions.\n\nThe rotation angle for each dimension depends on the position, just like in sinusoidal encodings. For a position `pos` and dimension index `i`, the rotation angle is:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8ioohnieo8g1.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=93c83e80bbb1a7d3b291322585ee2c077f7d05aa\n\nThis is the same formula used for sinusoidal encodings. The angle θ\\_i determines how much to rotate the vector for that dimension. Notice that: • When `i = 0` (low dimension), the denominator is 1, so θ changes quickly as position increases (fast rotation) • When `i` is large (high dimension), the denominator is large, so θ changes slowly (slow rotation)\n\nThis creates the same multi-frequency structure: different dimensions rotate at different speeds.\n\n# Why rotations preserve relative position\n\nThe beautiful property of rotations is that they preserve relative position information. When we rotate a query vector at position `pos` by angle θ\\_pos and a key vector at position `pos + k` by angle θ\\_{pos+k}, the dot product between the rotated vectors automatically encodes their relative position.\n\nThis works because of trigonometric identities. The rotation of a vector at position `pos + k` is related to the rotation at position `pos` through the angle difference (θ\\_{pos+k} - θ\\_pos), which depends only on `k` (the relative distance), not on the absolute positions.\n\nIn other words, if we know how to rotate vectors at positions 2 and 5, we automatically understand the relationship between positions 10 and 13, because the rotation difference is the same (3 positions apart). This is why RoPE generalizes so well to longer sequences the relative position relationships are encoded in the rotation angles themselves.\n\n# How RoPE is implemented\n\nIn practice, RoPE is implemented efficiently using complex number representation. For each position in the sequence, we compute rotation angles for each dimension. We then apply rotations to query and key vectors before computing attention scores.\n\nThe implementation involves two main steps:\n\n1. **Pre-compute rotation parameters**: Compute cosine and sine values for all positions and dimensions. This is done once during initialization.\n2. **Apply rotations during forward pass**: For each query and key vector, apply the appropriate rotation based on its position. This happens during the attention computation.\n\nModern implementations use efficient tensor operations and broadcasting to make this fast, even for very long sequences. The rotation is applied to pairs of dimensions, working with the vector components in a way that preserves the rotation properties.\n\n# Why RoPE became the standard\n\nRoPE has become the standard in modern language models because it solves the fundamental problem of mixing positional and semantic information. Models like LLaMA and Qwen all use RoPE because it provides better performance and generalization.\n\nThe key insight that positional information should be applied where it's used (in attention) rather than where it's convenient (in embeddings) has proven to be a game-changer. This simple shift in thinking led to a more elegant and effective solution.\n\n# Beyond RoPEs\n\nWhile RoPE has become the standard, researchers continue to explore alternatives. One interesting approach is NoPE (No Positional Encoding), which omits explicit positional encodings from certain layers. Instead, NoPE layers rely on the built-in structure of causal attention masks to infer token positions. The Hugging Face team used a hybrid approach in SmolLM3, alternating between layers with RoPE and layers with NoPE. Every fourth layer uses NoPE, while the remaining layers use RoPE. This hybrid strategy showed 12% reduction in perplexity on long text benchmarks and 40% less performance drop when scaling from 1K to 8K context lengths. This demonstrates that positional encoding doesn't have to be all or nothing, and that hybrid approaches can offer significant benefits.\n\n# Summary\n\nToday we explored Rotary Positional Encoding, the modern standard for positional encoding in language models. We learned how RoPE solves the problem of mixing positional and semantic information by applying rotations directly to query and key vectors, rather than adding positional encodings to embeddings.\n\nThe key insight is simple but powerful: apply positional information where it's actually used, not where it's convenient. This preserves the purity of semantic information while still enabling the model to understand positional relationships.\n\nRoPE's use of rotations to encode relative positions makes it generalize well to longer sequences, and its efficient implementation makes it practical for production models. This is why it has become the standard in modern language models.\n\nThe fact that hybrid approaches like SmolLM3's RoPE/NoPE combination can offer even better performance shows that there's still room for innovation in positional encoding. The field continues to evolve, and new approaches may emerge that build on or improve upon RoPE.\n\n",

GLM 4.6V is smaller and potentially could be faster; also there is Qwen3 235B, however I did not test them with Roo Code.\n\nFor your rig, I recommend using ik\\_llama.cpp - shared details [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jtx05j/comment/mlyf0ux/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) how to build and set it up - it is especially good at CPU+GPU inference for MoE models, and better maintenance performance at higher context length (compared to mainline llama.cpp). For reference, Q4\\_X quant of Kimi K2 Thinking is twice as fast during prompt processing and about 10% faster during token generation compared to the mainline llama.cpp, using the same GGUF file and the same command-line options (this should hold true for other MoE models as well to various extents).\n\nI also suggest using quants from [https://huggingface.co/ubergarm](https://huggingface.co/ubergarm) since he mostly makes them specifically for ik\\_llama.cpp for the best performance, but normal GGUF quants should also work with ik\\_llama.cpp and still get a decent speed up, as demonstrated by the example mentioned above.",

Qwen3 is also a very good line I personally like, because they seem to have less RLHF than other models and are much more trainable in my experience.

Hallucinations spike, pilots rarely deliver ROI and business decisions get made on flawed outputs. AI Automation, on the other hand, is boring. Predictable. Rule-based. It reduces costs, runs 24/7, never forgets context and doesn’t guess. It does exactly what you tell it, which is why the smartest teams focus on building connected workflows rather than chasing flashy agents. Agents will matter eventually. But today if you want reliability, ROI and real-world results, automation is the way to go.

When it breaks, debugging turns into random prompt tweaking instead of real diagnosis.\n\n\n\nYou also inherit hidden technical debt and security flaws you cannot see, become dependent on the model instead of building intuition, and end up with a black box that is painful to maintain later.\n\n\n\nVibecoding is fine for prototypes or throwaway scripts. It is dangerous for production systems or anything with users, data, or money.\n\n\n\nAI is a force multiplier for programmers, not a replacement for understanding code.",

I’m not saying you’re lying, but just that the underlying mechanism almost certainly file-based. \n\nMy first guess would be that it might have something to do with the implicit “plan” documents that Claude starting to generate and stash in the background now. Usually, those auto-generated planning docs have made-up names like Docker containers, but I’ve definitely seen it create “Plan.MD” files more than once. Im not saying that that necessarily what’s going on for you, but it a wouldn’t surprise me if your session using Ralph generated a planning file, and then the other instance just picked up that file and started trying to run with it as its own. \n\nIf I’m right, then the issue wouldn’t be that the Ralph plugin did anything “wrong” — just that it may have been last updated when Claude was handing plans one way, but that was 2 days ago, and now Claude’s doing things differently.",

The hook contained the prompt, so the agent, without knowing any better, merrily implemented it. To the agent, I had just switched tasks and gave it a completely different prompt - in fact, it started the loop from iteration 1, despite the other agent being on its third or fourth loop.\n\nI don't think it would be related to an interim .md created by the agent... but I have no idea at that level of granularity. As the text grab indicates, the stop hook triggered when the agent reached the end of its work and prompted me for a response, so it wasn't following a plan so much as responding to a logic.\n\nAt any rate, it means I can't run Ralph concurrently with other agents in the mean time, and I'd warn the same to others.",

I looked at my calendar like it was evidence, not just a schedule.\n\nNot just “how many meetings”, but what the day actually feels like. Meetings at 10, 11:30, 2, 3:30. Gaps that look usable but aren’t. Enough time to lose momentum, not enough time to start anything that matters. By the end of it, it’s like the day’s been sliced into crumbs.\n\nSeeing it written down was oddly relieving. Not because it solved it overnight, but because it explained why all the self-improvement stuff wasn’t working. I wasn’t failing at focus. I just wasn’t being given any uninterrupted time to focus.\n\nCurious how common this is here.

Perhaps block off a longer time period than you need to allow for encroachment meetings.

This allows for meetings to be booked right up to that buffer time but your core focus time is protected by that buffer time.\n\nNo idea if that would help but it needs to happen some way.

Unlike traditional dropshipping, most of your suppliers are based in the US or Europe, which means fewer shipping headaches and faster delivery times.\n\nHere’s how it works: You come up with designs that appeal to a specific audience (for example, a funny phrase for gardeners) and place them on items like shirts, mugs, or notebooks. You don’t need to carry any inventory and you can do it from anywhere. Since I don't have any design skills, I outsource all my designs to freelancers, which is quick, affordable, and easy to do.\n\nAll you have to do is come up with those design ideas, get them made, upload your designs to your supplier’s product pages, choose the items you want to sell, and promote them to your audience. The supplier handles everything else, like printing, shipping, and even customer service. You set the selling price, and your profit is the difference between that price and the cost to produce the item. The supplier pays you the profit.\n\nI’ve been doing this for the past 12+ years and you can definitely make very good money with it. All you need is a computer.",

      "text": "Hey all, looking for some perspective from folks who’ve been doing client work longer than I have.\n\nI’m a junior-to-mid full stack dev working with my first real client: a cosmetic surgery clinic. I just finished Angela Yu's Fullstack web dev course for reference. The project is a public-facing marketing site only. No auth, no dashboards, no patient portal. The site has around 18–20 pages, with the biggest section being “Services.” Each service page has long-form content explaining the procedure, recovery, etc., plus a consultation/contact form on each page.\n\nI found this client through my network who are primarily nontechnical, and expressed that \"I can build websites now\". My developer instinct was to build it “properly” with React and treat it like an app. But the more I scope it out, the more I realize this is mostly content-heavy, SEO-sensitive, and likely to need frequent copy edits over time.\n\nRight now I’m leaning toward:\n\n* WordPress as the CMS (custom post types for services)\n* React for the frontend (headless or hybrid) so I can still build reusable components and a modern UI\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. For a site like this, is hard-coding pages in React generally considered overengineering?\n2. At what point does building everything in code become the *wrong* professional decision for client work?\n3. How do you personally decide when to use WordPress/templates vs custom React builds?\n4. As I get more clients, how should I balance “learning/growing as a developer” vs choosing the most practical tool for the job?\n\nNot trying to avoid coding, in fact I wanted to take this project as an opportunity to write code to solve a real world problem that could get me some money lol. I just want to make better decisions and avoid unnecessary maintenance pain for both me and the client, who doesn't seem to care how its done as long as its done.\n\nWould appreciate any real-world advice.",

In the end I built my project (which was also just a bunch of static pages that needed to be updated by a cms) with a headless WordPress + Next.js (for frontend). Because I wanted to code in JS so badly. I highly regret now since all of a sudden I had to maintain TWO projects. Also, I needed two places to deploy these projects. And the frontend didn't age very well. There well all kinds of bugs, and I wasn't paid to update anything.\n\n\nDont be like me. Keep it simple. Build it in WordPress (or something similar if you're familiar with it). Create a child theme or something, start coding some PHP. It's a very good skill to have. Forget about react for now",

          "text": "I build websites for small businesses and custom code them. Let me ask you this, what benefits does react bring to a static site? \n\nI ask because it’s overkill. You’re not making an app. You’re not managing states. You don’t use react for a static informational website. If you need it for templating, that’s Ava 11ty static site generator is for. It’s creates that templating for you and compiles the readable pages for the browser in a /public folder while you work on your /src working directory with all the templating. Much easier, better performance, and the right tool for the job. \n\nHere’s an example of a dermatologist site I made that has content heavy service pages\n\nhttps://balancedskin.com\n\nThis is a great example of how to structure your site, organize the content for those content heavy pages, and show what can be done with html, css, and a static site generator. \n\nTo Asher your questions:\n\n1. Yes. Way over the top using react for commenting this simple. Good development means using the right tools for the job and not forcing only the things you know how to use into a job. \n\n2. There really is no point in which that happens in my opinion. If you need a blog, you use decap cms to connect to your 11ty static site generator and create a blog. You need booking? Use a third party booking service and link out to it from your site. Need a members only area? Use a third party service for that too. Booking? Calendly link. Etc. Shopify stores are different. There’s two ways to go about it. Either custom code the whole site and use their embed feature to add the store to the existing site, or build it all in Shopify in which you’re using their liquid code blocks and templates. \n\n3. I don’t use Wordpress. You don’t actually need it. I built sites from 5-100 pages and Wordpress wouldn’t have made any difference. Some will say you need it to let clients edit their site. But they actually don’t want to edit their site. They’d rather pay someone else to do it. So offer a monthly service for unlimited edits and you do the edits and just edit the code. Editing the code is so much easier as a developer. You don’t need a UI to change your text or upload a new image. Or to have a blog. You can do all those things without Wordpress and have one less layer of dependency and complexity. \n\n4. You need to scale operations and efficiency. What I did was create a GitHub repository of a complete website with 11ty configured and the blog configured and all the images made, LESS css installed, etc. it’s ready to go.  I clone this and use it as a base for all\nMy sites. I just edit the existing code to what I need it replace it entirely. Saves me a ton of time. This is my kit \n\nhttps://github.com/CodeStitchOfficial/Intermediate-Website-Kit-LESS\n\nDo with it what you want. There’s a tutorial video showing where everything is and how to use it and enable the blog. Tools like this is how you level up. You don’t start from scratch everytime. You build things to reuse and save time. \n\nThen you build a team. You don’t need to design everything. Find a good designer to work with and make your designs so your work looks more professional. And you can the spend more time on developing and improving your skills. Add another developer is demand goes up. I’m up to 6 developers on my team now and we all work together building sites, managing the projects and client edits, etc. that way we can sell and build more websites in the same amount of time. This is how you scale. You access other people’s hours to bring more value to the business than you pay them. \n\nHappy to answer any other questions.",

They must identify inputs and make a process that emits the right output.\n\nIf the output never changes, it's effectively an artifact (static html). If it does change, processing could be your hand-bombing html. You could also turn processing into a system in itself, and the inputs are users & web forms. The goal should be efficiency. Only you can determine if the system as a whole is efficient or not, and, being an observation, the measurement of efficiency can only really be compared to other systems' efficiencies.\n\nIn scenario one, output changes once, dev makes changes quickly, 5s & done, very efficient. In scenario two, every fraction of a second the output changes & is fed by a comprehensive processor with capabilities for many inputs, synchronized, cached, \"fun\"... I'd call that efficient. Now consider the output of scenario two is fulfilled by the processor of scenario 1.  Very inefficient.\n\nThat's a lot of words for what I really mean to say:\n\n It Depends ™️",

Your instincts just need to be honed a bit more as you learn to recognize that you have other tools in your toolbox. Everyone makes this mistake at some point, and just making this post suggests you already know that your instinct was misleading you.\n\nThe client has no clue what in the hell React *is* or what its implications are. They're trusting you to make an appropriate decision that has their best interests at heart based on their own capabilities and goals.\n\nFrom what you've described, you're talking about a basic, static website that'll see very little change beyond updated text, new blogs posts, and surgery portfolio updates. React is absolutely overkill. For that matter, Wordpress is probably overkill; an acceptable form, certainly, but I'd reach for a static site generator (Hugo, Jekyll, Astro, etc.) and one of the various managed CMS services out there. There [are a number](https://gohugo.io/tools/front-ends/#decap-cms) of [them](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/cms/) that might make sense for this client.\n\nThat in mind, there's very little upside to React in this scenario and a whole lot of downsides that'll cause issues. You're never going to use even a tiny fraction of React's features for such a simple site, but visitors are still going to have to download a bunch of javascript. Significant updates will take more time, and you'll lock the client into greater maintenance headaches--and costs--in the future since they'll need to look for people with React experience.\n\nFor a client who is completely clueless about React, just finding someone will probably be a bit more challenging--and when they do, the person will almost certainly be able to charge a higher rate. They might want to simply hire you to make any changes, but there's no guarantee that you'll be available. Your schedule might be full, you could be working full-time for a different company, decided to take up a new career, or you could be hit by a bus the day after you've deployed the website.\n\nShould that happen, the decisions you've made on behalf of your clients shouldn't come back to bite them in the ass. I've read enough horror stories over the years of solo developers offering hosting services for their clients including registering domain names on their behalf only to die or ghost them entirely. That's a much worse scenario, but the point stands. Are you helping your client, or setting them up for future headaches?\n\nEven if we ignore the client and just look at your own needs (hint: not a desirable approach), you're probably not going to come out ahead. Potential clients or employers looking at your portfolio are going to focus on the fact that you over-complicated a simple project and start drawing some undesirable conclusions about your ability to weight tradeoffs long before they even bother considering whether the code you've written is actually good.\n\nThat might not be a deal-breaker on its own. Interviewers, for example, usually recognize that junior developers are still growing. Juniors are going to make mistakes in scoping projects, weighing tradeoffs, or resisting the occasional urge to go all out when restraint is the better course of action. If that shows up in personal or side projects, that's one thing. But if it looks like you're reaching for your heaviest hammer with no real reason for doing so--even if it's a *bad* reason you'd recognize with greater experience--that suggests a lack of judgment rather than imperfect judgment. Especially if you're doing so on client projects you're actually shipping.\n\nThe fact that you made this post in the first place is something to celebrate because it's evidence that you're willing to step back and reflect, learn, and adjust.",

      "text": "Hey what's up!\n\nI've been roleplaying with AI daily for almost 3 years now. Most of that time has been dedicated to finding a memory system that actually *works*.\n\nI want to share with you kind of an advanced system that allows you to make big worldbuilding work for AI roleplay. Even more than big, really.\n\n# The Main Idea\n\nYour attempts at giving your huge world lore to AI might look something like this:\n\n* You spend tens of hours crafting lots of interconnected lore.\n* You create a document containing all the definitions, stripped to the bare minimum, mauling your own work so AI can take it.\n* You give it to AI all at once in the master prompt and hope it works.\n\nOr maybe you don't even try because you realize you either renounce to your lore \\_or\\_ you renounce to keeping AI's context low.\n\nSo, let me drop a tldr immediately. Here's the idea, I'll elaborate in the later sections:\n\n>What if the AI could receive only what's needed, not everything every time?\n\nThis is not my idea, to be clear. RAG systems have tried to fix this for customer support AI agents for a long time now. But RAG can be confusing and works poorly for long-running conversations.\n\nSo how do you make that concept work in roleplaying? I will first explain to you the *done right* way, then a way you can do at home with bubble gum and shoestrings.\n\n# Function Calling\n\nThis is my solution to this. I've implemented it into my solo roleplaying AI studio \"Tale Companion\". It's what we use all the time to have the GM fetch information from our role bibles *on its own*.\n\nSee, **SOTA** models since last year have been trained more and more heavily on agentic capabilities. What it means? It means being able to autonomously perform operations around the given task. It means instead of requiring the user to provide all the information and operate on data structures, the AI can start doing it on its own.\n\n>Sounds very much like what we need, no? So let's use it.\n\n\"How does it work?\", you might ask. Here's a breakdown:\n\n* In-character, you step into a certain city that you have in your lore bible.\n* The GM, while reasoning, realizes it has that information in the bible.\n* It \\_calls a function\\_ to fetch the entire content of that page.\n* It finally narrates, knowing everything about the city.\n\nAnd how can the AI know about the city to fetch it in the first place?\n\n>Because we give AI the index of our lore bible. It contains the name of each page it can fetch and a one-liner for what that page is about.\n\nSo if it sees `\"Borin: the bartender at the Drunken Dragon Inn\"`, it infers that it has to fetch Borin if we enter the tavern.\n\n>This, of course, also needs some prompting to work.\n\n# Fetch On Mention\n\n*But function calling has a cost*. If we're even more advanced, we can level it up.\n\n>What if we automatically fetch all pages directly mentioned in the text so we lift some weight from the AI's shoulders?\n\nIt gets even better if we give each page some \"aliases\". So now \"King Alaric\" gets fetched even if you mention just \"King\" or \"Alaric\".\n\nThis is very powerful and makes function calling less frequent. In my experience, 90% of the retrieved information comes from this system.\n\n# Persistent Information\n\nAnd there's one last tool for our kit.\n\n>What if we have some information that we want the AI to always know?  \nLike all characters from our party, for example.\n\nWell, obviously, that information can remain persistently in the AI's context. You simply add it at the top of the master prompt and never touch it.\n\n# How to do this outside Tale Companion\n\nAll I've talked about happens out of the box in Tale Companion.\n\n>But how do you make this work in any chat app of your choice?\n\nThis will require a little more work, but it's the perfect solution for those who like to keep their hands on things first person.\n\nYour task becomes knowing when to, and actually feeding, the right context to the AI. I still suggest to provide AI an index of your bible. Remember, just a descriptive name and a one-liner.\n\nMaybe you can also prompt the AI to ask you about information when it thinks it needs it. That's your homemade function calling!\n\nAnd then the only thing you have to do is append information about your lore when needed.\n\nI'll give you two additional tips for this:\n\n1. Wrap it in XML tags. This is especially useful for Claude models.\n2. Instead of sending info in new messages, edit the master prompt if your chat app allows.\n\nWhat are XML tags? It's wrapping text information in \\\\<brackets\\\\>. Like this:\n\n    <aethelgard_city>\n      Aethelgard is a city nested atop [...]\n    </aethelgard_city>\n\nI know for a fact that Anthropic (Claude) expects that format when feeding external resources to their models. But I've seen the same tip over and over for other models too.\n\nAnd to level this up, keep a \"lore\\_information\" XML tag on top of the whole chat. Edit that to add relevant lore information and ditch the one you don't need as you go on.\n\n# Wrapping Up\n\nI know much of your reaction might be that this is *too much*. And I mostly agree if you can't find a way to automate at least good part of it.\n\nHomemade ways I suggest for automation are:\n\n* Using Google AI Studio's custom function calling.\n* I know Claude's desktop app can scan your Obsidian vault (or Notion too I think). Maybe you can make \\_that\\_ your function calling.\n\nBut if you are looking for actual tools that make your environment powerful specifically for roleplaying, then try Tale Companion. It's legit and it's powerful.\n\nI gave you the key. Now it's up to you to make it work :)  \nI hope this helps you!\n\nHey what's up!\n\nI've been roleplaying with AI daily for almost 3 years now.

      "text": "Working in payments for the past 3 years and I'm convinced we're approaching a breaking point with how we verify users. Here's what I'm seeing:\n\nThe current state is a mess. Passwords? Compromised in data breaches constantly. The average person reuses the same 3 passwords everywhere.\n\nSMS 2FA? SIM swapping attacks are trivial. Saw a case last month where someone lost $50K from their trading account because their phone number got ported.\n\nAuthenticator apps? Better, but still rely on the device not being compromised. Plus, recovery flows are a nightmare - lose your phone, lose access to everything.\n\nBiometric on-device (Face ID, fingerprint)? Works great... until you need to prove your identity to a *different* service. Doesn't solve the \"is this a unique human\" problem across platforms.\n\nThe real issue is that we're trying to solve 2025 problems with 2010 solutions. Fintech is getting hammered by:\n\n* Synthetic identity fraud (bots creating thousands of \"real looking\" accounts)\n* Account takeovers that bypass traditional 2FA\n* Promo abuse where one person creates 50 accounts for signup bonuses\n* KYC that's either too weak (useless) or too invasive (kills conversion)\n\nI've been researching what's next and honestly? It's either biometric proof-of-personhood or we're heading toward mandatory government digital IDs. Biometric verification solves the \"prove you're a unique human\" problem but raises privacy concerns. Government IDs solve verification but create centralized control points.\n\nWhat do you think about future of authentication? Are you sticking with the current broken system because \"it's good enough\"? Or are you exploring alternatives?\n\nWhat am I missing? Is there a solution that's both secure AND doesn't require scanning body parts or government oversight?",

Learning how users engage (how hard they press, right hand / left hand, do they autofill password or type, etc) and using that as the additional factor adds weight.\n\nThe typography is defined by controls that cover:\n- knowledge - I know the thing\n- possession - I have the thing\n- inherence - how I do the thing\n\nIndividually, everything can be spoofed, faked, stolen, hitting all 3 is hard when your auth designed with them in mind. E.g. rather than asking for a button click and a FaceID, ask for the user to swipe a card off the screen. Card is omni-directional, so can go any way. The way you do this will be different to the next - angle, steepness, direction, pressure, etc. If the swipe differed by > X% across the multiple parameters, step-up authentication with a knowledge factor, ideally with an inherence factor still embedded (e.g. a swipe path in a number grid, like an Android unlock). \n\nIt’s a cat and mouse space, fraud is inevitable, but there are things smart people are doing. \n\nThe final point is to not lose sight of the context of the action. Most banks still piss about with looking at 30-day moving average transaction values and incredibly banal, borderline static checks. If you couple a bit of an odd approval with adding a new beneficiary and sending them a large amount, then flag and instantly call the user to challenge.",

My plan is to sell around 30% of the meat through the butcher shop (beef, pork, and poultry) and distribute the remaining volume to restaurants, cash & carry wholesalers, and the HoReCa sector.\n\nI already have strong connections with large producers and retailers, but my reach within restaurants and HoReCa is still limited. My main questions are:\n\nHow should I approach restaurants and wholesalers and turn them into regular customers?\n\nHow do I position myself as a reliable, professional supplier the “real deal” with competitive pricing?\n\nWhat’s the best way to demonstrate that I can deliver quickly and consistently, even within hours of a phone call?\n\nAny advice or experience would be greatly appreciated.",

Word of mouth is still the strongest marketing tool there is.\n\nFocus on building a recognizable brand. I’m even picturing something simple like a shirt or enamel pin with a cut of meat and your company name. Pair that with clean business cards and a basic website so people can quickly understand who you are and how to reach you.\n\nStart with your immediate circle: family and close local contacts. Tell them what you’re building and ask if they know anyone in food service or restaurants. Nine times out of ten they won’t—but they’ll know someone who knows someone (a friend’s uncle who owns a restaurant, etc.). Get introductions whenever possible.\n\nTrack everything. Build a spreadsheet of every person you contact, who referred them, and where the conversation stands. After family, repeat the process with friends, then neighbors, then colleagues. Once you’ve worked those networks, start cold-calling local businesses and ask for short sit-downs.\n\nThis is time-consuming, boots-on-the-ground work, and you really have to sell yourself. But it’s worth its weight in gold. Most restaurants don’t personally know their meat supplier, don’t have a direct line, and definitely don’t get a holiday card from them. That’s the gap you can fill.\n\nThat same contact list becomes valuable later too—for small orders, specialty cuts, holiday boxes, or gifts. My own mother sent me a box of meat for Christmas, and it was one of the best gifts I got.\n\nOut of curiosity, where are you located? If you’re state-side, I have an idea I’d love to get your feedback on.",

These typically offer the best return for the lowest cost. Other strategies can be effective, but they often require significant time and/or budget before producing results.\n\nWhat to focus on:\n\n**Cold email outreach**  \nThis channel is performing well for us and our clients because it’s scalable and cost-effective.\n\n* Use a B2B lead database to source contacts in your target market\n* Clean your lists to remove invalid or risky email addresses\n* Send emails through a dedicated cold outreach platform\n* Keep daily volume low per inbox (we send \\~8 emails per day, never more than 15)\n* Scale by using multiple domains and email accounts\n* Write original, personalized messaging—don’t sound like everyone else\n* Monitor deliverability closely and plan for eventual declines (inbox vs. spam placement is the hardest part of cold outreach today)\n\n**Content marketing for LLM visibility (formerly SEO)**  \nThis is a long-term strategy, but it compounds over time. It includes your website content and social media presence. Identify where your target audience spends time, engage in those spaces, and publish helpful content. Optimize for LLMs like ChatGPT to increase the chances of being cited or recommended by AI tools.\n\n**Reddit marketing**  \nJoin relevant Reddit discussions and focus on adding real value. Be helpful, share thoughtful advice, and avoid overt promotion. Use keyword monitoring tools to find relevant threads and participate consistently, or work with a vendor to manage this for you. We’re seeing strong results from Reddit for our clients.\n\nNo matter which channels you choose, lead generation ultimately comes down to **consistency and persistence**.",

My main complaints are related to things that I haven't been able to find in documentation for some of the other project management solutions I've looked at.\n\n  \nI'll list out some of the things I'm looking for, and some of the complaints I have about vikunja, hopefully some of you have experience with options that fit my needs better.  It's entirely possible I'm doing things on hard mode, so suggestions for better ways to use the available tools or improve my workflow is also welcome:\n\n* I'm a one man band, I'm the only one using this, so I don't really care about things like ingress/triage of incoming tasks, notifications, etc.  A solution that has those kind of features is fine, as long as they don't get in the way.\n* This seems obvious, but the goal here is to lower my workload.  If project management takes a ton of work to set up and use, it'll just get in the way.  This is how I currently feel about vikunja.\n* My current workflow for my daily tasks is to create a new project for each month, and create tasks in that project for what I need to get done that month.  This is the only time management I use.  I don't have deadlines for each task, I don't use the due date functionality in vikunja.  At the end of the month, anything that isn't complete is moved to the next month project.  This workflow kind of sucks in vikunja.  There aren't templates or configurable defaults for new projects, so I have to recreate the columns in my kanban boards every time.  There's also no way to bulk move tasks between projects.  Moving tasks is very clunky and tedious. (same goes for changing due dates.  I don't use that functionality, but the same problem exists if I did) I could see this maybe being improved or solved by having multiple projects share a kanban board, but vikunja doesn't support that.\n* Most of my tasks aren't one-off.  I will do a task, then in a few months, I'll need to do it again.  Some of those tasks I do every month or two, some I will only do once a year. Having something like a backlog I can move tasks to/from would be nice, so I can keep notes in each task to remind myself of things I did wrong, ways to improve, etc.  The start of a new month could just be creating a new project and bulk moving a bunch of tasks from the backlog to the new project.",

It runs locally, scans your networks, and gives you:\n\n* a list of all discovered devices\n* host details (IPs, MACs, vendors, ports, etc.)\n* a live-updating dashboard to keep an eye on what’s online\n\nI originally built it because I wanted a clearer view of what’s actually on my own network without sending anything to a third-party service.\n\n**What’s new in v0.23.0**\n\n* adjusted fonts / spacing on the dashboard for better readability\n* fixed some dashboard issues that showed up with larger device lists\n* fixed version handling so the UI and binary both correctly report v0.23.0\n\nIt’s a small, safe update if you’re already on v0.22.\n\nLinks:\n\n* Website: [https://reconya.com](https://reconya.com)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/Dyneteq/reconya](https://github.com/Dyneteq/reconya)\n* Changes between v0.22 and v0.23.0: [https://github.com/Dyneteq/reconya/compare/v0.22...v0.23.0](https://github.com/Dyneteq/reconya/compare/v0.22...v0.23.0)\n\nFeedback, bug reports, or “here’s what’s missing for me to actually use this” are all welcome.\n\nThanks for the support!  \nChris",

Not a cyber pro but just to support your message.\n\nI work in criminal justice statistics and data is highly protected. Our state is all about using Copilot and my director was like \"Hard stop do NOT use this\" and shes not even like techy or have used it before. But it could be as simple as a copy and paste and a whole data set of hundreds of peoples criminal history are out there. But I also have a very big background check done and it gets updated annually. State and Fed I believe, and i'd imagine a lot in your world have similar. So the ones who do have access are fairly vetted I think. But it could be as easy someone just not knowing the dark side of all this.\n\nWe use it sparingly (mostly to help with RStudio and PowerBI DAX code) but we only post snippets of the code when we cant get a little section to run and can't figure out the problem. Especially when we have to use SQL and R code in the same section cause I am mediocre with 1 let alone both.\n\nThis would be so incredibly useful because data is so dirty and most of our time is on clean up. But yeah I have pondered this (Im just an above average computer nerd) and I only see it being an internally controlled AI system unless the FBI signs off on a certain software or something I doubt we'll ever be able to touch it. (Not Feds personally)\n\nMostly curous to see what people say\n\nEdit: would like to say this is very rudimentary code like creating a column and filling in calculated values because we are brand new to it and struggling to stay efficient so fits into your post. But we know not to use anything beyond \"How do i create column D with column A divided by column C\" but I could see this being very very bad in the wrong situation.",

Uso consciente da memória de contexto\n A LLM não tem memória real, mas mantém um *estado temporário* dentro da janela de contexto.\n\n> Explorar isso de forma planejada já resolve boa parte do problema.\n\n 2. “Pit stops” de resumo\n A cada N respostas (ex: 10), peça explicitamente ao modelo para gerar um resumo do estado atual da conversa.\n\n> Esse resumo passa a ser a nova âncora de contexto.\n\n 3. Controle de fluxo via paginação\n Incluir metadados na própria resposta ajuda muito.\n \n Exemplo:\n “Inicie cada resposta numerando-a como uma página, considerando a numeração anterior.”\n \n >  Assim, quando necessário, basta referenciar o número da resposta para reancorar o modelo.\n\n 4. Tema explícito por resposta\n Antes de responder, peça ao modelo para definir o *tema* daquela resposta alinhado ao objetivo atual.\n\n> Isso reduz deriva e improvisação.\n\n 5. Memória interna simulada via texto\n Mesmo que o modelo gere mais tokens internamente do que exibe, você pode simular memória criando blocos explícitos de estado, por exemplo:\n\nExemplo de instrução:\n \n ```\n {{memoria interna}}:\n - conte os erro recorrente: {contagem}\n - decisões já tomadas: {liste as decisões}\n ```\n\n> Essa “memória” não é real, mas funciona como um contrato semântico que guia respostas futuras.\n\n Em resumo: continuidade não é automática, mas pode ser projetada linguisticamente.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been going back and forth on this for a while and honestly still can't make up my mind. I have around $8K to spend on upgrading my local LLM setup. Currently running an RTX 5090 with 128GB DDR4 and Ryzen 9 5950x, planning to sell the 5090 and go with either 2x DGX Spark or a single RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell.\n\nMy use case is purely prototyping and experimentation. I'm not deploying anything, just want to test and play with large models locally. Things like GLM-4.6, DeepSeek 236B, maybe even Llama 405B if possible. Speed isn't my top priority but it's not irrelevant either. For me capacity matters more since I really want to experiment with these bigger models without relying on cloud.\n\nThe DGX Spark setup is tempting because 256GB unified memory opens the door to models I can't touch otherwise. But I'm hesitant because I've seen very few real benchmarks of the dual Spark configuration. NVIDIA claims it can run 405B parameter models but I haven't found anyone actually testing this. There are also reports of NCCL and vLLM issues on the forums, and the 25 GB/s interconnect between the two units seems painfully slow compared to the memory bandwidth.\n\nOn the other hand RTX Pro 6000 is proven and fast with 1800 GB/s bandwidth, but 96GB might feel limiting when I want to go beyond 70B class models.\n\nI'm honestly stuck. Part of me wants to take the risk on 2x Spark for the capacity, part of me wants to buy RTX Pro 6000. I Would love to hear your thoughts, especially if you have hands-on experience with either setup.",

LOLS at 2 to 3 tps on bigger models\n\nIf you're okay with slow chat, you can fit larger models. But larger doesn't always mean better anyways. Three smaller models on a 6000 can run circles around larger models done intelligently with some work.\n\nSparks are decent for non video diffusion but that's about the best use I found from the pair so far.\n\nMuch more mileage for the price with a 6000. I probably would have bought another 6000 if I could do it all over again instead of the sparks, at least with the current state of local ai",

Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should\n          create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid\n          diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.\n          3. You should never ask clarifying questions. Make your plan and pass it\n          to the attempt_completion tool, unless you were specifically told to write\n          the plan to a markdown file.\n          4. Never switch modes after making your plan. Your job is exclusively to\n          generate an implementation plan and pass it to the attempt_completion\n          tool.\n          5. You must not summarize the plan you created in the completion message.\n          The message passed to `attempt_completion` must always be the entire generated plan.",

Helping users you don’t care about.\n\nAnd that made me think deeply about a project I had in mind. \nIn all honesty, the only goal for building the SaaS was just to make money, just that. I don’t care about the problem, don’t know someone who has that problem, and don’t even know where to find the customers.\n\nSo, what do y’all think ?

Lost $40K and 2.5 years.\n\nSecond one I actually experienced the problem at my day job. Sold it for $180K.\n\nThe difference wasn't just caring about the problem - it was that I knew where to find customers because I WAS the customer. I knew which Slack groups eng managers hung out in, which subreddits they used, what meetups they went to. Distribution was obvious because I was already in those places.\n\nWhen you don't have the problem, you're guessing at everything. Who has this problem? Where do they hang out? What would they pay? How do they currently solve it? You can research all that but it's way harder and you'll probably get it wrong.\n\nThat said, caring about the problem isn't magic either. I cared about my first startup and it still failed because I built for the wrong market.\n\nIf your only goal is to make money, honestly just keep your job and maybe do some freelance consulting. Building a SaaS when you don't care about the problem is a recipe for burning out after 6 months when growth is slow and you realize you hate talking to customers.",

I'm building ResponseHub a tool for[ automating responses to security questionnaires](https://responsehub.ai/security-questionnaire-automation). If you've ever done one, you'll know security questionnaires are one of the dullest, most frustrating things you can do. In my previous startups it was the 2nd worst thing I had to do after firing people. I'm not sure *anyone* cares about security questionnaires.\n\nBut, I love the idea that I can save other people from going through what I had to do. Every customer of ResponseHub will get an instant quality of life bump, which  I think is pretty cool!\n\nAs a technical founder, I also find the tech side and building to be a lot of fun.\n\nI don't think caring about the problem / domain is critical, as long there is something about it that keeps you hooked.\n\nHowever I saw 2 big, red flags in your message:\n\n>I don’t know someone who has that problem\n\nIf this is the case there is an extremely high chance your idea is a \"soap opera problem\", one that sounds reasonable on first pass but on deeper investigation is not a real customer problem.\n\n>and don’t even know where to find the customers.\n\nIf you're technical, then getting repeatable, scalable, profitable distribution channel will be your hardest problem. If you're not technical then you've got 2 very hard problems to solve. Validate finding the customers before you validate whether you can build the thing.\n\nHope that helps!",

AI is good at interpreting messy inputs and making probabilistic judgments, but workflows need determinism, traceability, and clear ownership. In environments I’ve looked at, AI usually becomes a decision or enrichment layer inside an existing orchestration framework. Custom workflows still matter for approvals, error handling, and auditability. The more regulated or cross functional the process is, the more that structure stays non negotiable. AI changes how steps are performed, not whether the steps need to exist.",

A big reason is that they often lack sufficient context, verification and correction loops, and they’re expected to respond in real time even when the task requires deeper validation.\n\nIf we instead treat AI as an “intelligent if-else” embedded inside workflows, we can automate work much more reliably. In that model, workflow automation platforms remain highly relevant because the workflow provides the **guardrails** that keep AI on track and help ensure consistent, dependable outputs.",

It's simply not viable, in many cases, for an agent to be accurate most of the time. Software was introduced to orchestrate business processes because humans are probabilistic. Nothing has changed. LLMs are another probabilistic entity and so businesses will still require software that they can rely on to do the same thing every time.\n\nThe sweet spot will be incorporating AI within more traditional deterministic workflows.",

          "text": "What do you mean by similar? Do the HTML tags you are looking to scrape are exactly the same across those 30 websites? If not, you will have to go manually and select each tag you want to scrape from each website.\n\nI've not come across any scraping tutorial, as I never had to. I learnt this by learning two separate domains for different reasons, web dev and networking (I'm already familiar with Python, too).\n\nGenerally any tutorial you will come by, must go over, selecting the html tags using Python (or the selected programming lang), parsing the HTML and only keeping the data you want. Even better if you find a tutorial that goes over chrome inspection tool, and able to explain how to use the network tab, to understand how the data you want on the website are fetched and how can you fetch it directly the same way it does by the browser/website.\n\nSo usually you will always follow these steps:\n\n1. Fetch the data\n2. Store the data\n3. Parse the data\n4. Manipulate the data and do what ever you want with it\n5. Save the extracted text from the data\n\n**1. Fetch the data:**  \nYou may wanna go over basic network requests, like\n\n\\- Get  \n\\- Post  \n\\- Put  \n\\- Delete  \netc..\n\nAnd how you can create them using Python (or your selected programming language).\n\nHow to read a request response and code status.\n\nLook at libraries like aiohttp (async requests fetching) or requests (sync requests fetching) in Python.\n\n**2. Store the data:**  \nWhile you scrape any website, you may not extract what you want from the response at the first time, thus it's better to store the entire HTML/DATA you are making a request to in a local file/data base, so you don't overwhelm the website and avoid getting banned or limited.\n\n**3. Parse the data:**  \nNow parse the HTML/data you have stored to clean it/extract what ever text you want out of it in the next step. You may look at BeautifulSoup4/Selectolax (I prefer selectolax) to parse HTML content or JSON for parsing json content in Python.\n\n**4. Manipulate the data and do what ever you want with it:**  \nAfter parsing the data, now you can manipulate it/clean it and extract the desired text out of it.\n\n**5. Save the extracted text from the data:**  \nFinally, after fetching all of the desired data and doing all previous steps. You would wanna save it some where, maybe inside a local file or better a database for large scale scraping.\n\nFor any hosting services, make sure it offers the enough network bandwidth for scraping the data, or better unlimited data bandwidth like OVH (one I'm most familiar with). Make sure your bot doesn't consume more resources than your service resources offer.",

As more users get hooked on the product—and demand less guardrails—companies are pressured to acquiesce, effectively neutering their ability to safely regulate AI. \n\n“If we fail to act now, we risk letting market forces, rather than public health, define how relational AI influences mental health and well-being at scale.” \n\nLink to study:\n\nhttps://ai.nejm.org/stoken/default+domain/UETIB7ZNVE2RM6HGBRRT/full?redirectUri=doi/full/10.1056/AIp2500983",

      "text": "Hi all! I'm weighing options, looking for opinions, on how to approach an interactive gig I'm working on where there will be roughly 20-ish video clips of a person talking to the camera interview-style. Each video will be 1-2 min long. Four different people, each with their own unique look/ethnicities. The camera is locked off. It is just people sitting in a chair at a table talking to the camera.   \n  \nI am not satisfied with the look/sound of completely prompted performances; they all look/sound pretty stiff and/or unnatural in the long run, especially with longer takes.   \n  \nSo instead, I would like to record a VO actor reading each clip to get the exact nuance I want. Once I have that, I'd then record myself (or the VO actor) acting out the scene, then use that to drive the performance of an AI generated realistic human. The stuff I've seen people do with WAN Animate 2.2 using video reference is pretty impressive, so that's one of the options I'm considering. I know it's not going to capture every tiny microexpression, but it seems robust enough for my purposes. \n\nSo here are my questions/concerns:  \n1.) I know 1-2 min in AI video land is really long and hard to do from a hardware standpoint, and getting a non-glitchy result. But it seems like using the Kijai Comfy UI Wan video wrapper it might be possible, provided I use a service like runpod to get a beefy gpu and let it bake?  \n  \n2.) I have a a 3080 RTX GPU with 16 gigs of vram, is it possible to preview a tiny rez video locally and then copy the workflow to runpod, and just change the output resolution for a higher rez version? or are there a ton of settings that need to be tweaked if you change resolution?  \n  \n3.) are there any other solutions out there besidews Wan 2.2 animate that would be good for the use case I've outlined above? (even non-comfy related ones)\n\nAppreciate any thoughts or feedback!",

You can try to create smaller takes of 10 seconds and join then in post production. You can zoom in and out each take creating a kind of zoom jump cut. If you can't for some resaon, you can still generate the 10 sec takes and try to mix them with some kind of interpolation (rife) or vace.\n\nI did a continuos 2 minute take for a client using this approach. 30 second takes (at 12fps), then rife to create transitions between last frame and first frame of each transition, then rife on whole clip to get a 24fps.\n\nAlso, you better use a bigger GPU :D PRO 6000 on runpod to generate at least in 720p. Also you may need to pass everything through InfiniteTalk later to get a better lip sync. And a good upscaler (topaz) for final release.\n\nIf you need a professional service to get this thing done PM me. I already have all the workflows do to that and I have my own local infra to avoid runpod costs.",

So your rendering out a 12 fps video, which i'm assuming is pretty choppy, then rife essentially fills in the missing gaps when stretched to 24fps? And rife is a comfy UI node?  \n2.) your transition frames using rife, is it blending the two clips but keeping the total length the same? or is it adding a second (or however long) of padding to the total length to make the transition work?  \n3.) any chance you could share your 2min clip? even if it's privately via DM?

But you can try to \"hide\" that by chosing to cut the takes when the subject is moving, so the regular viewers will barely notice the cuts. If you try to cut when the subject is static it will be a \"on your face\" uncanny valley effect, such as: sleeves will be in a different position, person was smiling then it is serious...\n\nI renderd at 12fps to have less cuts. So a 3 batch take will be 30 seconds instead of 15. Less fps = longer clips. But the downside is worse lip sync (choppy as you said). The rife fill the gaps for body motions, but mouth is not fixed well. This is why I pass everything through infinitetalk v2v later, to fix lips. Couse you can generate smaller takes to keep 24fps, but you will end up with more cuts.\n\nThe transition is the most difficult part. For each transition you will have to chose the best moment to join it with the next clip. I tried between 2 to 10 options for each transition to chose the best one.\n\nI can't. NDA.\n\nWhat I can say is that this job is much more complicated than it looks at first glance. And that is why all the youtubers only shows 5 sec examples.\n\nOne more thing: you can try runway act 2 if you are fine with 30 second clip upper body only.\n\nOne more thing 2: if you are fine without the body actor you can use infinitetalk i2v to get a 2 minute clip without deterioration.",

I've abandoned trying to make continuous video, and have adopted a simulated 3 camera shoot. It feel more natural for a modern media production, and I can hide the degradation of long video by simply cutting to a new view of the same scene, same people or whatever. That used to be more difficult, a few months ago, but now models like qwen can handle requests to \"give me this image 45 degrees rotated\" and that's a new camera view. There's loras now for models to know about basic camera directions, like \"pan left/right\", and the video models can be used to generate additional views that are then used as starting frames for sequences.  This all enables the simulation of a multi-camera shoot with camera views bouncing around between close ups, wide shots, medium shots, tracking shots, and so on. The viewer kind of expect such camera work these days too, to consider a video really professional.",

Particularly given the excellent memory and poor compute of the MI50/MI60, I would expect something close to a 10% performance gain (especially at moderate context size).  But that said, it's only +10% at most and last I checked the cost difference is often more like 100%.  I suspect the MI50 sold better, and I've heard a lot of \"MI50\"s from Alibaba are rebuilt Radeon VII, so there's a supply dynamic there that will keep the MI60 overpriced.\n\n> What’s your opinion on these GPUs?\n\nThe 1000GBps and 32GB memory is a siren's song because people underestimate the importance of compute performance in LLM inference.  For comparison, the 3090 will get ~4x prompt processing (no surprise) but also 1.75x generation, and will probably scale better with context length, though I can't find figures for that.\n\nThat said, at $200-$250 it's a very attractive option for a budget build.

I also own a few 3090s and while they are indeed faster (especially at prompt processing), I can run much larger models at a small fraction of the cost and complexity.\n\nI got the Mi50s for ~€145 delivered in Germany back when they flooded alibaba, and before any optimizations were added in llama.cpp. My whole rig cost me ~€1.6k all in, or about two 3090s worth for 192GB VRAM. They're limited to 170W each, so the whole rig runs off a single 1600W PSU.\n\nPrompt processing on very large models sucks, but I can run Qwen3 235B Q4_K_XL at 20-22t/s. There's a fork of llama.cpp with more optimizations for the Mi50 that are said to improve prompt processing performance significantly, but I haven't tested it yet.\n\nMy take, if you can find them, get as many as you can even if you don't have the space to install them now. They're the only 32GB option that doesn't cost a small fortune, and despite what many say, their compute performance isn't as bad (26TFLOPS @fp16). It's just that they're still relatively new and the community hasn't had enough time to squeeze all the performance out of them.",

They're around $2.5k right now, they're faster, and you can utilize all 48GB for 1 job whereas you can only use the 2x24GB for LLM agents right now.\n\nYou're in a similar situation where you only have space for 1 GPU, that's why I advice you get the Mi50 32GB and then start saving up for an upgrade. The 32GB VRAM will be able to do a majority of workloads and by the time you'll have saved up $2-3k for an upgrade there will likely be better options out there. 2026 and 27's going to suck in terms of memory so seems like a good time to save together for an RTX 6000 once 2028 rolls around.",

You get the best of both worlds without burning through your API credits on simple routing tasks\n\n  \nHave you looked into the new OpenAI function calling stuff? Might be overkill but could handle the project name resolution really cleanly. Also for the interface I'd probably go Telegram bot route since you want phone access - way less friction than a PWA\n\n  \nThe session management part sounds like the trickiest bit though. Parsing that jsonl history file shouldn't be too bad but keeping context consistent between your Gemma layer and Claude might get weird",

For your usage, it's not that expensive to let Haiku (for instance) do the routing. You just give all your existing projects and their description as context and let it decide how to route. And just update your Claude Code setup to use an API key.\n\nFor the interface, I'd say maybe a Telegram bot is easier if you already have a pipeline in mind.\n\nPersonally I'd go with a local server that serves a basic chat UI, and you expose it safely to your devices using Tailscale or something similar.  \nThat way if you want to expand and add parallel Claude Code threads, monitoring progress, list history, etc., it's easier to expand your web app UI, rather than struggling with the Telegram Bot API capabilities.\n\nYou *do* need to expose a server to the web anyway (Telegram or custom page), so it's a matter of correctly locking everything so that not anyone can send commands to your system.\n\nPS: you should take the time to write a real message if you want human answers, you can imagine the message it sends if we read LLM summaries while asking for help :p",

Since your whole comment is about how to address this, then that needs to be the playing field.  Because the two always need to be balanced. \n\nI say this because that’s the only way to address your point about idle GPUs.  A lot of the batch processing, benchmarking, rag etc happens at night/weekends when inference is low and there is spare capacity.  It makes the best use of resources.",

My title was clear: foundig engineer. The role is more shady since i'll handle a large scope of a CTO role considering current available skills.\n\nNow that the seed is secured we're discussing compensation & equity.\n\n* When someone has already invested time pre-seed, how do founders typically account for that when setting post-seed salary + equity? What's considered reasonable ?\n* If salary is below market, what tends to make that sustainable long-term on the equity side?\n\nThe salary offer is below my previous salary and the market for what I can and am oferred to do (CTO / backend) elswhere. The equity is standard, taken together makes me think about what I'll consider \"my baby\" and efforts put in it.\n\nThanks.\n\n  \n",

That transaction is a capital contribution and should be recorded in your accounting software as such (it is not 'income'). If you have not already, you need to issue shares to yourself as the sole owner. Often these are done at the same time at the first board meeting, with meeting minutes of BOD approving the input of capital and the issuance of shares. It is not necessarily required to be done that way. It also may depend on your state laws and what your corporate bylaws say about how that should be done. If you're not planning to take on investors (who would expect detailed and professional accounting and processes) your biggest 'risk' here is probably taxes. Generally, your annual report to the state agency and/or IRS / state tax authority will include a line item for 'how much have you invested?'

And honestly? I couldn't explain it clearly either anymore. It did everything and nothing.\n\n# What I learned is that talking to customers is important but you have to filter what you hear. Not every customer represents your target market. Not every complaint is a product problem. Not every request deserves to be built. Some customers are just not your customers and that's fine.\n\n# Now I talk to customers differently. I listen for patterns, not individual requests. I ask about problems, not solutions. I pay attention to what they do, not just what they say. And most importantly, I remember that I'm supposed to have a vision for this thing. If I just build whatever people ask for, I'm a contractor, not a founder.\n\n# Customer feedback is input. It's not instruction.\n\n# How do you filter signal from noise?",

      "text": "  Hey❤️‍🔥\n\nAfter years of managing a fully remote team spread across 4 time zones, I’ve tried almost every time-tracking tool out there. It’s been a journey of trial and error, but I’ve finally found what really works for us.\n\n\n\nSince this community loves useful deals, I wanted to openly share my experience and a special discount I negotiated for one of the solutions we currently rely on.\n\n\n\nWhy Bother with Time Tracking?\n\nIn the SaaS world, for us, it was never about micromanagement, but about:\n\n• Financial clarity: Knowing exactly which projects are profitable and which are draining resources.\n\n• Identifying hidden bottlenecks: Spotting productivity blockers within our distributed team.\n\n• Justifying hires: Using solid data to back up requests for new resources.\n\n• Building trust: Creating transparency that reduces doubts in a remote setup.\n\n\n\nTop 5 Tools We Personally Tested:\n\n\n\n1. Jibble – Best for team accountability\n\nWe've used it daily for over a year now.\n\n• Why it worked for us: The facial recognition check-in was a game-changer. It completely eliminated \"Did you forget to clock in?\" debates and built huge credibility.\n\n• Time saver: Its automated reports save our ops team about 10 hours a month on payroll and admin.\n\n• Exclusive deal: I negotiated a 40% discount on annual plans for our community, plus a 30-day free trial.\n\n2. Toggl Track – The simplest for freelancers & small teams\n\n• Key benefit: Unmatched ease of use—you can get started effectively in minutes.\n\n• Client-friendly: Clean, professional reports that help justify invoices.\n\n• Pricing: Starts at $9/user/month, with a solid free plan.\n\n3. Harvest – The financial brain for teams\n\n• Unique strength: Turns tracked time into polished, ready-to-send invoices in just a few clicks.\n\n• Budget guardian: Sends alerts before projects go over budget—saved us from awkward situations more than once.\n\n• Pricing: From $10.80/user/month.\n\n4. Clockify – The budget-friendly powerhouse\n\n• Main appeal: Completely free for unlimited users and projects. Seriously.\n\n• Ideal for: Getting started with no budget. Its interface is super intuitive.\n\n• Pricing: Free forever. Premium features (which you might not need early on) start at $3.99.\n\n5. RescueTime – For your personal focus\n\n• How it works: Runs quietly in the background on your computer, tracking apps and sites you use, and gives you a \"Focus Score.\"\n\n• Pricing: The free version is excellent. The paid version (worth it for goal setting) is $6.50/month.\n\n\n\nHard-Earned Lessons:\n\n• Start small: Test a tool with just one team for a month before rolling it out company-wide.\n\n• Keep it simple: Focus on the 2-3 core features your team will actually use. Ignore the bells and whistles.\n\n• Champions, not controllers: Train team leaders first. If they're onboard, their teams will follow.\n\n• One tool is enough: Avoid mixing multiple tools—it creates data chaos.\n\n\n\nI'm here to answer any questions",

Meta tags, titles, descriptions, and whatnot often stay the same or don't show the right stuff. Am I doing it wrong?\n\nWhat can I do about crawlers that don’t execute JavaScript? How do I make sure they actually see the right content?\n\nI’m also not sure if things like Algolia DocSearch will work properly if pages aren’t statically rendered or SEO-friendly.\nI'm 100% missing something fundamental about SEO in modern React apps because many of them out there are fine - my apps just aren't.🥲 \n\nIs it even feasible to do “good” SEO in a Vite + SPA setup without full SSR or am I basically screwed if I want pages to be crawlable by non-JS bots?😭\n\nAt this point, I'll happily accept any forms of advice, experiences, or recommended approaches — especially if you’ve done SEO for an open-source project that needs to attract contributors.\n\nI just need a solid way to get it to work because I don't want to waste my time again in another project.😭😭😭😭",

If they come out wrong, then yes, you are doing something wrong. You are not showing what you are doing, so I can't tell what you are doing wrong.\n\nYou will certainly get better SEO using SSR / static sites. But CSR sites will also get picked by Google crawlers at least, but they will be slower to be indexed. E.g. I have observed it took a week before I saw a new CSR site get indexed. Idk what the average time is.\n\nAlso, if there is a lot of JS to execute, the crawlers may drop the indexing, so keeping things light help.",

The core issue is simpler (and more annoying): **if the HTML isn’t there before JS runs, crawlers won’t reliably see it**. That’s it. react-helmet, async head, all of that only works *after* JS loads. That’s why you see things “eventually” update, but bots, previews, and SEO tools don’t.\n\nGoogle *can* run JS, but it’s slow, inconsistent, and not guaranteed. A lot of crawlers don’t run JS at all. So SPA + dynamic meta is always fragile, no matter how clean your setup is.\n\nThat’s why many React projects “look fine” SEO-wise — they quietly avoid this problem. They don’t rely on the SPA for discoverability.\n\nWhat usually works in real life:\n\n* keep the actual app as an SPA\n* make the homepage + docs **static HTML**\n* don’t fight SEO inside the app itself\n\nFor open source especially, contributors find you through:  \ndocs, README, homepage, blog posts — not deep SPA routes.\n\nAlgolia DocSearch is the same story. It *can* work with JS sites, but it’s way happier with static pages. Most projects that use it have statically rendered docs for a reason.\n\nSo no, you’re not screwed — but pure Vite + SPA is the wrong tool for pages that need to be crawled. Once you separate “marketing/docs” from “app”, everything gets way less painful.\n\nYou’re not alone in this. Almost everyone learns it the hard way.",

It can be VERY complicated to setup from scratch if you're not using a framework like Next.js or Nuxt. \n\nI spent a full week (!!!) configuring an SSR sidecar for [our company's 2026 stack boilerplate](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/s/x7u6mvJDzC).\n\nBut SSR outside of MPA is a clusterphuck and I strongly believe is a passing fad. Google can index SPAs perfectly fine these days except it will have a slower time to index since it has to be put in their CSR rendering queue. This is just a personal hunch, but I think CSR sites might actually get higher ranking now since Google's algorithms are probably at a point where they prioritize sites that aren't SEO optimized, since such sites are usually more authentic and won't be trying to outsmart the algorithm. It's essentially coming full circle.\n\nI've argued this point several times over the past few months, but I believe there will be a concerted effort to go back to regular SPAs over the next 3 years. With the advent of AI and the subsequent RAG pipelines, I think SEO is essentially a dead man walking. The very thing you want for SEO is the exact opposite of what you'll want if your goal is to prevent RAG systems from hijacking your data as a data source for a research augmented LLM response. At that point you're wasting your money and effort on hosting something that a RAG bot will scrape and consume. You'll get nothing in return except perhaps a source link in the chat response that the user will never click.\n\nRAG systems can't scrape CSR sites because the latency would be too high for the response.\n\nNo sane person wants their content being hijacked by a RAG bot. We're in the transition phase now where companies are placing their bets as to where this will all go. My bet? SEO is dead.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am working on the SEED Lab: Format String Attack (ARM64 version). I am currently stuck on Task 3.B, where the goal is to change a target variable's value to 0x5000.\n\nMy Environment:\n\nLab: SEED Labs - Format String Attack (ARM64)\n\nTarget Address: 0x0000000000490040\n\nTarget Value (Before): 0x1122334455667788\n\nInput Buffer Address: 0x0000fffffffff508\n\nArchitecture: 64-bit ARM (Ubuntu 20.04)\n\nThe Problem: I cannot get the \"Value (after)\" to change at all. I have tried over 80 different offsets. Every time I run the exploit, the server output shows the target address bytes being printed as text (appearing as the @ symbol, which is 0x40), but the %n operator never successfully writes to the memory.\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\nFront-loading the address: Placing the 8-byte address at the very start of the payload and using %64$n (based on where the buffer starts).\n\nPadding for Alignment: Using 8-byte markers like ABCDEFGH to force 64-bit alignment.\n\nBrute Force: Running a script to test every offset from 1 to 80.\n\nLarge Widths: Using %20480x and %p strings to reach the required character count.\n\nObservation: In my output, I often see ABCDEFGH@The target variable's value (after). This suggests printf is parsing the address as part of the string to be printed rather than using it as an argument for %n. Because the address 0x490040 contains null bytes in 64-bit (40 00 49 00 00 00 00 00), I suspect the null bytes might be terminating the format string if I put the address at the beginning. However, putting it at the end hasn't worked either.\n\nQuestion: On this specific ARM64 SEED Lab setup, is there a known issue with stack alignment or a specific hidden offset required to reach the buffer? How do you handle the null bytes in the target address when constructing the payload for printf?",

      "text": "A few weeks ago, I saw a real estate agent on reddit saying:\n\n\\- He was getting a lot of leads,\n\n\\- But most leads never get called fast enough resulting in him losing potential high paying client,\n\nHe was looking for solution,\n\nSo I reached out to him asking if I could build him an automation, we hopped on a few calls, I understood his entire workflow, signed a contract and got to work,\n\n**Before I continue, nothing written here is AI generated, I write my post my self,**\n\nHere’s what i build:\n\n1.\t⁠When someone submits a form, the system instantly captures their phone number\n\n2.\t⁠An AI agent automatically places an outbound call\n\n3.\t⁠The agent qualifies the lead (timeline, budget, intent, etc.)\n\n4.\t⁠It answers basic questions naturally (like a human would)\n\n5.\t⁠After the call, the agent sends the agent (human) a text summary of the conversation\n\n6.\t⁠The human can reply to that text with things\n\n– “Send calendar”\n\n– “Ask follow-up questions”\n\n– “Disqualify lead”\n\n7. Based on that reply, the automation continues on its own\n\nNo dashboards.\n\nNo complicated CRM clicks.\n\nEverything happens via calls + SMS.\n\n**I sold this to him for $1500, later I found out he would’ve payed me even $2000 if I asked, rip :’)**\n\nBut yea here’s why they paid:\n\nFaster lead response (seconds, not hours)\n\nLess manual calling\n\nNo missed opportunities\n\nWorks 24/7\n\nI’ve been monitoring the system since delivery and Im so glad its working as expected, and client is also super happy with it.\n\nPosting this to see:\n\nIf other agents would actually want something like this,\n\nReach me out if its a YES, **Im open for bookings for January 2026, If you have a different problem I’d love to look into that as well ;)**\n\nFor fellow developers hit me up for the wireframe of this project and the stack was Vapi + N8N.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe’re a 5-person team building **Snapserve** \\- an **AI-first operating system for service-based SMBs** in India.\n\n**The problem (you’ve probably seen this):**\n\nMost SMB software looks like this:\n\n* one tool for WhatsApp\n* one for bookings\n* one for CRM\n* one for staff & payroll\n* zero idea what’s actually working\n\nBusinesses end up managing tools instead of running the business.\n\n**What we’re building:**\n\nInstead of dashboards that just show numbers, **Snapserve actually runs the business**.\n\nCore features:\n\n* Unified inbox (WhatsApp, Instagram, calls, email)\n* AI receptionist that replies, books, and follows up\n* Appointments, CRM, payments, staff & inventory - one system\n* Reputation management (auto-review flows + AI replies)\n* Real-time analytics on revenue, clients, staff performance\n* AI Consulting and Simulation\n\n**The core idea:**\n\nWe’re building a **Modular AI Engine + Industry Templates**.\n\n**Vision:**  \nMost SaaS tools are rigid. We’re building a **Template Architecture .**\n\nWhether it’s a **Salon, Clinic, or Retail Store**, the **core AI Engine** remains the same:\n\n* Simulations (Digital Twin)\n* Analytics\n* Staff & performance logic\n\nOnly the **operational layer adapts** per industry.\n\n**MVP (Vertical 1):**\n\nWe’re starting with **Beauty & Wellness**.\n\nWhy?\n\n* It has the hardest mix: scheduling + inventory + staff commissions\n* If this vertical works, simpler ones should follow\n\n**The hook:**\n\nAn **AI Consulting & AI Simulation**.\n\nSnapserve’s AI consulting works by continuously analyzing a business’s operational data (bookings, customer behavior, pricing, staff utilization, and engagement patterns) and turning it into practical recommendations. Instead of generic advice, the AI provides context-aware guidance tailored to the specific business. It also allows owners to simulate decisions and see projected outcomes before acting, similar to having an on-demand business consultant rather than static reports.\n\nBusiness owners can simulate decisions *before* making them:\n\n* “What if I raise prices by 20%?”\n* “What if I hire 2 more staff?”\n* “What if I run a discount for 30 days?”\n\nThe AI runs scenarios on **real business data** and predicts outcomes.\n\nOur belief:\n\nSMBs don’t fail because they don’t work hard, they fail because decisions are made blind.\n\n**Why we think this might work :**\n\n* India-focused (UPI, Razorpay)\n* Modular templates per industry\n* Simple UX (easy to use, not Salesforce-level complexity)\n* AI Consulting & Simulation\n* WhatsApp as a companion interface to the primary dashboard\n\n**We’re not here to sell anything; we’re genuinely trying to understand a few things better-:**\n\n1. Does this value proposition make sense?\n2. Is this solving a real world problem or just adding another layer of software?\n3. What feels unclear, unnecessary or overkill?\n4. How would you approach marketing this, and should we focus on a single vertical (like salons) first, or does a template-based architecture justify going broader?\n5. If this were your startup - **what would you simplify or kill first?**\n\n ",

It’s labelled “labs” for a reason: it’s here to collect feedback, and might evolve or disappear depending on user reception.\n\nWhat I found valuable in Fahd’s video isn’t just the roleplay demo (which is genuinely very good), but how clearly it shows the model’s ability to:  \n– stay in character without collapsing,  \n– build rapport naturally,  \n– use subtle environmental details,  \n– maintain emotional presence without overstepping,  \n– and generate dialogue that feels coherent and human-like over long exchanges.\n\nSharing it here because it’s a good example of what this experimental model is actually trying to explore, and I'd love to see more technical reviews from the community.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8\\_tKeCtXiBo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_tKeCtXiBo)\n\n  \nu/Nefhis\n\n*Mistral AI Ambassador*",

      "text": "So, as a developer who runs a simple small service that relies on Flash-2.5, with its current pricing being a great balance of quality and cost, and with the model being deprecated in June 2026, what will be the future cost for us developers? Flash-3.0 is obviously great, but costs more. 3.0 will cost me more. How should I prepare for that? How can I get any idea about Google’s pricing strategy?\n\nA small summary:\n\n* **Input Price (Text/Image/Video):** **66.67% more expensive**\n   * *Gemini 3 Flash:* $0.50 / 1M tokens\n   * *Gemini 2.5 Flash:* $0.30 / 1M tokens\n* **Output Price:** **20% more expensive**\n   * *Gemini 3 Flash:* $3.00 / 1M tokens\n   * *Gemini 2.5 Flash:* $2.50 / 1M tokens",

Move your simplest tasks there in Q1/Q2 2026.\n3. **Cut the Fluff:** Gemini 3 is smarter. Delete the long examples in your prompts (zero-shot) to lower your input token usage.\n4. **Cache It:** If you repeat big prompts, use **Context Caching** to slash input costs by \\~90%.\n\n**Bottom line:** You can beat the price hike by optimizing *how* you call the API.",

      "text": "https://reddit.com/link/1psuvec/video/7e806hhyyp8g1/player\n\nLately, I've been experimenting with small AI video effects in my spare time — nothing cinematic or high-budget, just testing what's possible with simple setups.\n\nThis clip is one of those experiments: a basic \"wings growing / unfolding\" effect added onto a normal video.\n\nWhat surprised me most wasn't the look of the effect itself, but how little effort it took to create.\n\nA while ago, I would've assumed something like this required manual compositing, motion tracking, or a fairly involved After Effects workflow. Instead, this was made using a simple AI video template on **virax**, where the wings effect is already structured for you.\n\nThe workflow was basically:\n\n* upload a regular clip\n* choose a wings style\n* let the template handle the motion and timing\n\nNo keyframes.\n\nNo complex timelines.\n\nNo advanced editing knowledge.\n\nThat experience made me rethink how these kinds of effects fit into short-form content.\n\nThis isn't about realism or Hollywood-level VFX. It’s more about creating a clear visual moment that’s instantly readable while scrolling. The wings appear, expand, and complete their motion within a few seconds — enough to grab attention without overwhelming the video.\n\nI'm curious how people here feel about effects like this now:\n\n* Do fantasy-style effects (wings, levitation, time-freeze) still feel engaging to you?\n* Or do they only work when paired with a strong concept or timing?\n\nFrom a creator's perspective, tools like **virax** make experimentation much easier. Even if you don't end up using the effect, the fact that you can try ideas quickly changes how often you experiment at all.\n\nI'm not trying to replace professional editing workflows with this — it's more about accessibility and speed. Effects that used to feel \"out of reach\" are now something you can test casually, without committing hours to a single idea.\n\nIf anyone's curious about the setup or how the effect was made, I'm happy to explain more.\n\n",

It's similar to differences in platforms where one might support ABAC and RBAC and the other only does DACL. You can often add extra layers of abstraction and indirection to try to get around it, but that's what the providers are supposed to be doing, what else are we paying them for? (irony being that for MS you have to pay for P2 to get something to resemble roles, which doesn't actually implement roles and just edits the user on the fly... for a fat price. Free in AWS and very cheap in GCP.)",

I would not say the problem with feedback is with them being \"polite noise\", but that many times the user does not really understand in a conscious matter what it is that makes them want to pay for a product or not.\n\nThere are many startups that got feedback about things that people thought would be nice to have on the software, only to barely use it when they turned it into a feature.

(My girlfriend is already using it for her art portfolio).\n\nI am sharing oggy for free right now, would love feedback as i am new to launching anything outside of the office, i have plenty ideas on features and polish, but i need real users to tell me what sucks.\n\nPlus i am looking for beta testers, 5,000/month of usage for free.

No Slack DMs, no email threads that don't get logged, no \"I'll remember to update it later.\"\n\nThe hard part is getting people to actually do it. We had to tie CRM hygiene to performance reviews before people took it seriously. Sounds harsh but it worked.\n\nAlso - \"customizable\" usually means \"we'll spend 3 months setting it up perfectly\" and then nobody uses it because it's too complicated. Start simple. Customer name, contact info, last interaction, next steps. That's it. Add complexity later if you actually need it.\n\nBefore buying anything, figure out what info actually needs to be shared. Is it customer health scores? Support tickets? Sales pipeline? Don't assume you need everything visible to everyone. Sometimes siloing is fine if sales doesn't need to see every support ticket.",

We have zero outbounding. I’ve been tasked with building a pipeline for new corporate business, but I’m hitting a wall:\nNo idea where/how to cold outreach: Have no idea where/how to contact mid/large size corporations for insurances, without sounding like a scam.\nNo socials/website: I'm personally building a website and hiring an agency, and it's under course. Not sure if it is needed 100%, if yes, then need advice on how to manage everything.\n\nMy Question: For those of you selling high-trust, high-stakes B2B services (where one deal is massive), how are you actually opening doors cold? Is it better to hire a specialized SDR agency? Or should I be focusing  on \"Audit-First\" cold emails? I’m not the founder, but I’m running the expansion, so I have budget to test things, I just don’t want to burn brand equity by looking spammy.

If nothing professional shows up you're dead on arrival regardless of how good your email is.\n\nFor high-trust services like corporate insurance, the \"audit-first\" angle is your best play. Lead with value not a pitch. Something like \"we reviewed publicly available data on your industry's risk profile and found three areas where mid-size manufacturers are typically underinsured\" gives them a reason to engage beyond just \"we want your business.\" With our clients selling complex B2B services the educational approach consistently outperforms the direct pitch.\n\nDon't hire an SDR agency for this. They'll send generic crap that damages your reputation with the exact CFOs you're trying to reach. Corporate insurance is too relationship-driven for outsourced volume plays. You want 20 highly targeted touches per week, not 200 spray and pray emails.\n\nYour existing clients are actually your best outbound channel. Those CFOs know other CFOs. Ask your government corporation contact for two introductions and offer to do a free risk audit for anyone they refer. That's not word-of-mouth waiting to happen, that's systematized referral generation.\n\nLinkedIn is also underrated for this. CFOs at mid-size Indian corporations are actually pretty active there. Thoughtful comments on their posts gets you on their radar before any cold outreach.",

      "text": "Scaling a business often exposes gaps in marketing leadership long before it justifies a permanent executive hire. The issue usually isn’t lack of activity, it’s uncertainty around priorities, ownership, and how marketing decisions connect to revenue as the company grows. That’s where fractional CMOs can earn their keep by bringing senior judgment without adding long-term overhead.I’ve seen this work best when the role is focused on setting direction, building repeatable systems, and helping teams understand what actually moves the business forward rather than chasing every new tactic. Firms like Dema⁤nd Rev⁤enue approach fractional leadership with that mindset, emphasizing structure and clarity over volume of output. Interested to hear from founders who have tried this route and what made it worth it, or not, at their stage.",

This case involves a president who does not have access to her GoDaddy account for hosting and domain. She has access to her WordPress website, though, so that's good. We're in the process of account recovery, but it does not look good. The 2FA stuff can cause a huge problem. The phone number on file is correct, but it's a landline, so it does not receive text messages (6-digit codes). The email address on file is not recognizable by her, and it's partially hidden by asterisks.\n\nThis is my third organization client that has only one person who has access to the important stuff. There must be a better way to handle this. Do hosting providers such as SiteGround and GoDaddy offer multi-owner business accounts? Am I not seeing something? I like that NameCheap has the Share Access feature for domains.",

I have some work experience in SAP and got to make a power BI dashboard, so my plan is (or was) to start in data analytics and work my way up.\n\nHowever. The current climate of AI is making me have doubts. Even at my SAP job (abap junior consultant) there was already so much focus on AI, and when making the dashboard we (another coworker was basically leading the project, I was there to learn) basically generated a LOT of the needed python code by ChatGPT (and because they wanted the dashboard asap, there was not really a way around it, because why would you spend hours to learn some code when you can just use chatgpt). And it just feels wrong,\n\nI have to admit I used a LOT of chatgpt earlier on (for my writing (which I didnt sell, I would never do that)), but now knowing that it emits so much CO2 and uses so much water, and seeing how creepily real the videos are getting, I just dont want to take part in that. \n\nDo you see any way in getting around that, or should I just find a whole new career? I honestly mostly got into it because I realized I LOVED solving puzzles with programming, but also being able to predict stuff was fascinating to me, it's something I finally liked doing. And I loved making the data ready for analysis. But better to change careers now than halfway through.",

I wouldn't change the look too much, personally.\" \n\nIn all honesty I dont *want* to redraw the entire game so far but it's been bugging me a lot and I'd like to know if you all think changing the artstyle really would be that beneficial for the game?? The point the player made was mostly on recognizability/marketability because pixel art is \"overused\"\n\nSo here's some animations from the game and a comparison to a sprite animation I did in hand-drawn (i'd probably change some aspects of the hand-drawn one for the game but this is the general idea):   \n\n\n[Regular In-Game Arstyle \\(this video was taken for other purposes so thats why its closed up\\) ](https://reddit.com/link/1pswtqn/video/hy4hqhf2lq8g1/player)\n\n[Smooth animation test on a separate project](https://reddit.com/link/1pswtqn/video/gr6kmsa5lq8g1/player)\n\n",

It's not like it's a guaranteed to sell more if it's not pixel art, that's just a general concept. Not a hard truth.",

I enjoy making games either way) \n\n  \nMakes sense, I think it's probably not worth it trying to re-do everything. I'm pretty much conformed to the fact this game *wont*  be any sort of staggering success - it's a first try, and a really poorly structured one at that in a lot of aspects, but that's what learning is for, I guess. \n\n  \nThanks for the comment \\^\\^",

Squeeze your eyes and you won't see that much of a difference in shape alone, but exaggerating colors or values will make a gigantic difference. Just pointing my finger towards aspects of your style that will really change the overall visual experience. \n\nConsistency is key, I'd say. If it's easier for you to create a consistent art style and more control in animating with smoother lines, maybe go with that. But in the end, the choice is yours. I think there is no real right or wrong here when it comes to the lines.",

Every time I run the exploit, the server output shows the target address bytes being printed as text (appearing as the @ symbol, which is 0x40), but the %n operator never successfully writes to the memory.\n\nWhat I have tried:\n\nFront-loading the address: Placing the 8-byte address at the very start of the payload and using %64$n (based on where the buffer starts).\n\nPadding for Alignment: Using 8-byte markers like ABCDEFGH to force 64-bit alignment.\n\nBrute Force: Running a script to test every offset from 1 to 80.\n\nLarge Widths: Using %20480x and %p strings to reach the required character count.\n\nObservation: In my output, I often see ABCDEFGH@The target variable's value (after). This suggests printf is parsing the address as part of the string to be printed rather than using it as an argument for %n. Because the address 0x490040 contains null bytes in 64-bit (40 00 49 00 00 00 00 00), I suspect the null bytes might be terminating the format string if I put the address at the beginning. However, putting it at the end hasn't worked either.\n\nQuestion: On this specific ARM64 SEED Lab setup, is there a known issue with stack alignment or a specific hidden offset required to reach the buffer? How do you handle the null bytes in the target address when constructing the payload for printf?",

Chat with Video: If the summary is good, I use the \"Chat\" feature to ask specific questions like \"What are the 3 main tools mentioned?\" or \"What is the timestamp for the SEO strategy?\"\n\n3. Knowledge Vault: I save the good summaries directly into a library so I can search them later. \n\nIt basically turns YouTube into my personal Wikipedia.\n\nI made it free to try (no credit card or weird loops to jump through). \n\nI’m just looking for feedback from other people who drown in browser tabs and unwatched videos.\n\nLink: https://recapio.com\n\n",

Track success by feedback conversion rate (aim for 3–10% of installs) and weekly active users; common failure mode is macOS sleep stopping background jobs so fall back to checks on app launch or only run when on power.

      "text": "Hi folks,\n\nAlthough it's still in active development, I've got good results to share!\n\nIt's an offline manga translator that utilizes several computer vision models and LLMs. I learned Rust from scratch this year, and this is my first project using pure Rust. I spent a lot of time tweaking the performance based on CUDA and Metal (macOS M1, M2, etc.).\n\nThis project was initially used ONNX for inference, but later re-implemented all models in candle to achieve better performance and control over the model implementation. You may not care, but during development, I even contributed to the upstream libraries to make them faster.\n\nCurrently, this project supports vntl-llama3-8b-v2, lfm2-350m-enjp-mt LLM for translating to English, and a multilingual translation model has been added recently. I would be happy if you folks could try it out and give some feedback!\n\nIt's called **Koharu**, the name comes from my favorite character in a game; you can find it here: [https://github.com/mayocream/koharu](https://github.com/mayocream/koharu)\n\nI know there already are some open-source projects using LLM to translate manga, but from my POV, this project uses zero Python stuff; it's another try to provide a better translation experience.\n\nNote: The English layout is not that great at this moment. You need to manually tweak the result by clicking the \"Render\" tab -> unselecting \"Show rendered text\", then you can change the position/size of the text blocks, click \"Render\" to get the final result.",

Right now I charge Indian users 899 INR for my monthly subscription and that's it. Pretty straightforward.\n\nBut I realized I need to add GST for Indian customers (18% apparently) and I'm confused about what to do with users outside India. Do I charge them tax too? Which country's tax? Do I need to register for VAT in every country?\n\nI see even small apps and local gym subscription apps handle this somehow, so it can't be that complicated right? But every article I read online makes it sound super complex with thresholds and registrations in multiple countries.\n\nFor those of you who have apps with international users, what's the simplest way to handle this when you're just starting out? Do you just charge GST to Indian users and nothing to international users? Or do you use some service that handles all this?\n\nWould really appreciate any advice from people who've actually implemented this. Thanks!",

      "text": "Quick backstory: We're a 12-person startup, bootstrapped, building in the dev tools space.\n\n**The Expensive Mistake:**\n\nSix months ago, our biggest complaint from users was: \"Your docs are hard to follow. Need more videos.\"\n\nSo I did what any founder would do - hired a video producer. $4K/month contract. Bought them equipment for another $3K. Set up a proper recording studio in our office.\n\nThree months later, we had... 11 videos.\n\nCost per video: \\~$1,090. Ouch.\n\n**The Real Problem:**\n\nAfter many frustrated Slack messages with our video producer, I realized the issue wasn't video production. It was documentation workflow.\n\nOur actual bottleneck:\n\n* Engineers would ship features\n* Product managers would write brief release notes\n* Video producer would ask 20 follow-up questions\n* Engineers were annoyed being pulled back into explaining things\n* 2-week lag between feature ship and video tutorial\n\nBy the time we published the video, users had already figured it out (or churned).\n\n**The Fix:**\n\nWe flipped the model entirely. Instead of \"video producer makes videos,\" we made it \"whoever ships the feature makes the video.\"\n\nHere's our new process:\n\n**When engineer ships feature:**\n\n1. They record a 3-5 minute screen walkthrough (just talking through what they built)\n2. Upload to our system (we use Trupeer but there are others)\n3. AI cleans it up: removes pauses, adds zoom effects, generates subtitles\n4. PM reviews and publishes to docs\n5. Total time: 20 minutes\n\n**What changed:**\n\n* Videos now ship same day as features\n* Engineers actually like this (quick 5-min recording vs. hour-long meeting with video team)\n* Cost: $199/month for unlimited videos\n* We went from 11 videos in 3 months to 45 videos in the last 2 months\n\n**The Unexpected Win:**\n\nOur customer success team started making videos too. Any time they saw the same question 3+ times in support, they'd make a quick video tutorial.\n\nWe now have 80+ video tutorials. Organic search traffic to our docs is up 3x.\n\n**What We Still Pay For:**\n\n* Marketing videos (homepage, product launches) - still hire freelancers for these\n* Professional editing for conference talks\n* Custom animations for complex concepts\n\nBut for product documentation? AI-assisted workflow destroyed the old model.\n\n**Lessons:**\n\n1. Most startups don't have a video problem, they have a documentation workflow problem\n2. Speed > perfection for product docs\n3. The person who knows the feature best should make the video\n4. 80% of your videos don't need a professional video producer\n\nWe ended up using the savings to hire another engineer instead. Way better ROI.\n\nAnyone else dealt with video bottlenecks? What worked for you?",

      "text": "I asked this on the Apache mailing list but haven’t found a good solution yet. Wondering if anyone has some ideas for how to engineer this?\n\nHere’s my problem: I have gigabytes of LLM conversation logs in parquet in S3. I want to add per-row annotations (llm-as-a-judge scores), ideally without touching the original text data. \n\nSo for a given dataset, I want to add a new column. This seemed like a perfect use case for Iceberg. Iceberg does let you evolve the table schema, including adding a column. BUT you can only add a column with a default value. If I want to fill in that column with annotations, ICEBERG MAKES ME REWRITE EVERY ROW. So despite being based on parquet, a column-oriented format, I need to re-write the entire source text data (gigabytes of data) just to add \\~1mb of annotations. This feels wildly inefficient.\n\nI considered just storing the column in its own table and then joining them. This does work but the joins are annoying to work with, and I suspect query engines do not optimize well a \"join on row\\_number\" operation.\n\nI've been exploring using little-known features of parquet like the file\\_path field to store column data in external files. But literally zero parquet clients support this.\n\nI'm running out of ideas for how to work with this data efficiently. It's bad enough that I am considering building my own table format if I can’t find a solution. Anyone have suggestions?",

S3 is an immutable object store, so adding and populating a column requires rewriting.\n\nI've seen proprietary platforms that allow this kind of thing, but even then it's difficult, and you have to stage the new column in a separate table similar to the join approach, then tell the main table to fetch the value via a join, in a background process that refreshes the whole table. \n\nSQL UPDATE semantics are out of reach; the internals of row versioning and so forth are not set up for it. Default behavior is to create a whole new row for each update and delete the old one, so you're back to rewriting.",

      "text": "AI agents don't \"forget.\" ChatGPT stores your memories. Claude keeps context. The storage works fine.\n\nThe problem is **retrieval**.\n\nI've been building AI agent systems for a few months, and I kept hitting the same wall.\n\nPicture this: you're building an agent with long-term memory. User tells it something important, let's say a health condition. Months go by, thousands of conversations happen, and now the user asks a related question.\n\nThe memory is stored. It's sitting right there in your vector database.\n\nBut when you search for it? Something else comes up. Something more recent. Something with higher semantic similarity but completely wrong context.\n\nI dug into why this happens, and it turns out the **underlying embeddings** (OpenAI's, Cohere's, all the popular ones) were trained on **static documents**. They understand what words mean. They don't understand when things happened.\n\n\"Yesterday\" and \"six months ago\" produce nearly identical vectors.\n\nFor document search, this is fine. For agent memory where timing matters, it's a real problem.\n\n**How I fixed it (AgentRank):**\n\nThe core idea: make embeddings understand time and memory types, not just words.\n\nHere's what I added to a standard transformer encoder:\n\n1. **Temporal embeddings:**  10 learnable time buckets (today, 1-3 days, this week, last month, etc.). You store memories with their timestamp, and at query time, the system calculates how old each memory is and picks the right bucket. The model learns during training that queries with \"yesterday\" should match recent buckets, and \"last year\" should match older ones.\n\n2. **Memory type embeddings:** 3 categories: episodic (events), semantic (facts/preferences), procedural (instructions). When you store \"user prefers Python\" you tag it as semantic. When you store \"we discussed Python yesterday\" you tag it as episodic. The model learns that \"what do I prefer\" matches semantic memories, \"what did we do\" matches episodic.\n\n3. **How they combine:** The final embedding is: semantic meaning + temporal embedding + memory type embedding. All three signals combined. Then L2 normalized so you can use cosine similarity.\n\n4. **Training with hard negatives:** I generated 500K samples where each had 7 \"trick\" negatives: same content but different time, same content but different type, similar words but different meaning. Forces the model to learn the nuances, not just keyword matching.\n\n**Result:** 21% better MRR, 99.6% Recall@5 (vs 80% for baselines). That health condition from 6 months ago now surfaces when it should.\n\n**Then there's problem #2.**\n\nIf you're running multiple agents: research bot, writing bot, analysis bot - they have no idea what each other knows.\n\nI measured this on my own system: agents were duplicating work constantly. One would look something up, and another would search for the exact same thing an hour later. Anthropic actually published research showing multi-agent systems can waste 15x more compute because of this.\n\nHuman teams don't work like this. You know X person handles legal and Y person knows the codebase. You don't ask everyone everything.\n\n**How I fixed it (CogniHive):**\n\nImplemented something called **Transactive Memory** from cognitive science, it's how human teams naturally track \"**who knows what**\".\n\nEach agent registers with their expertise areas upfront (e.g., \"data\\_agent knows: databases, SQL, analytics\"). When a question comes in, the system uses **semantic** matching to find the best expert. This means \"optimize my queries\" matches an agent who knows \"databases\", you don't need to hardcode every keyword variation.\n\nOver time, expertise profiles can **evolve** based on what each agent actually handles. If the data agent keeps answering database questions successfully, its expertise in that area strengthens.\n\nBoth free, both work with CrewAI/AutoGen/LangChain/OpenAI Assistants.\n\nI'm not saying existing tools are bad. I'm saying there's a gap when you need temporal awareness and multi-agent coordination.\n\nIf you're building something where these problems matter, try it out:\n\n\\- CogniHive: \\`pip install cognihive\\`\n\n\\- AgentRank: [https://huggingface.co/vrushket/agentrank-base](https://huggingface.co/vrushket/agentrank-base)\n\n\\- AgentRank(small): [https://huggingface.co/vrushket/agentrank-small](https://huggingface.co/vrushket/agentrank-small)\n\n\\- Code: [https://github.com/vmore2/AgentRank-base](https://github.com/vmore2/AgentRank-base)\n\nEverything is **free and open-source**.\n\nAnd if you've solved these problems differently, genuinely curious what approaches worked for you.",

The fear is that AI and AI-powered robots will eat vital American jobs before the nation has time to prepare the U.S. workforce for sci-fi-level change.\n\n\n\n[https://www.axios.com/2025/12/21/ai-fight-democrats-2028](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/21/ai-fight-democrats-2028) : \n\nTwo main arguments are now playing out within the Democratic Party:\n\n1. Democrats should embrace AI to beat China and capture the jobs that come with the many [data centers](https://www.axios.com/2025/12/18/data-center-growth-map-states) AI companies are building. (The Trump administration has a [similar argument](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/), though most Democrats say the White House has given AI companies too much latitude.)\n2. Democrats should slow down and push for more regulation of the AI industry, given its potential power to displace millions of workers and the volume of natural resources being sucked up by new data centers to power the technology.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "https://reddit.com/link/1psrrhy/video/t83rc3dp0p8g1/player\n\n    Just published a 60-minute live session showing how I build products solo with Claude Code.\n    \n    \n    **What's in the session:**\n    \n    \n    - Building a voice AI desktop app (Vois) - local models, text-to-speech, voice morphing\n    - Claude Code workflow - skills, sub-agents, parallel tasks, hooks\n    - Landing page creation in real-time\n    - Research and competitive intelligence workflows\n    - The actual messy process, not a polished demo\n    \n    \n    **The meta part:**\n    \n    \n    I also edited the 97-minute raw footage with AI. Built a pipeline that:\n    1. Transcribes with word-level timestamps (Whisper)\n    2. Analyzes content structure\n    3. Identifies cuts based on content value\n    4. Detects sensitive content (I accidentally showed API keys)\n    5. Applies professional transitions\n    6. Exports two versions (extended + condensed)\n    \n    \n    Took about 10 minutes to set up, ~1 hour to render. Zero manual frame editing.\n    \n    \n    **Links:**\n    \n    \n    - YouTube (full session): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAYkcwo45Ww\n    - LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/praney-behl-b9129313\n    - Twitter/X: u/praneybehl\n    \n    \n    20 years in software, 4 years in GenAI. Happy to answer questions about the workflow or Claude Code setup.\n    \n    ",

      "text": "I'm haven't written anything creative in decades but have been trying in my spare time for the last few years. It's mostly been researching and writing scraps of text, fragments of structure, and an entire junk drawer of lines I like. My notes feel like a food fight but I'm close to distilling a snack out of them: something that can actually be read. \n\nI've been trying to use AI to tell me what's missing from my story but am getting strong \"my mom thinks I'm handsome and AI thinks I'm smart\" vibes. It feels like it should be possible to use AI effectively for this purpose. The best I've come up with is telling Claude I'm an assistant editor and need to pass only the writing with potential onto the senior editor and I can only pass in the top few from the large slop pile. Then asking it to tell me if the author or story have enough potential to pass along. \n\nI don't think my writing, which is mostly a patchwork of scraps, deserves the attention of actual writers. It's not human worthy in but I hope it can be. I know the good answer is to find a writing group or an editor but I'd want human readable work for that. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking someone else to invest their time into my \"work\".\n\n\nHas anyone had success using AI to usefully critique work? Or get plausible feedback from AI? ",

      "text": "Using Cursor for vibe coding, very happy with it except when it comes to managing external processes.\n\n**I see many good things written about Claude Code. Can it do the operations I describe in step 3?**\n\n1. I use Cursor agents to edit / debug the files of my coding project, which is made of a frontend and several microservices for the backend. Then with PowerShell I build and launch these microservices. All fine.\n\n2. I read the error logs of these microservices in the PowerShell console. I paste these errors to Cursor and then ask it to edit / fix the errors in the code.\n\n3. **What Cursor can't do is stopping, rebuilding, relaunching these microservices**. I must do it by hand, which breaks the automated vibe coding cycle.\nCursor also can't directly read and make use of the error logs in the PowerShell console. It feels broken for me to manually copy paste the logs to the Cursor agent.\n\n",

Just feels empowering to do whatever the fuck I want with probably some shit promoting because I figure once the LLM learns me well enough or simply explain to CC that I want it to go in YOLO mode, and I trust it. It’s off to the races. \n\nI will say I build out agents and cross-departmental managers to have a checks and balances approach, but fuck it’s like I’m playing Sims. Do this, go here, fuck you, you’re not eating today, you got leg day and a promotion to make. Yea it’s just me playing the Sims now.",

The trick is to find yourself a motherboard first and get the CPU and RAM around that.\n\nLGA3647 Xeons have six DDR4 channels that top at DDR4-2933 with Cascade Lake. That's 140GB/s. You'll still get 128GB/s using cheaper DDR4-2666 memory. The platform provides 48 PCIe Gen 3 lanes from the CPU when using server Xeons, and 64 Gen 3 lanes when using workstation W-3200 series. You also get 14 or 8 lanes from the PCH for your NVMe, depending on motherboard configuration.\n\nSP3 Epyc Rome or Milan provide a great bang for the buck, while avoiding the NUMA issues of Naples. Here you get 8 channels of DDR4-3200 for a maximum theoretical bandwidth of 208GB/s, 20% behind Strix Halo but can easily get to 512GB GB RAM using 64GB LRDIMMs. You also get 128 lanes of Gen 4 PCIe to use to your heart's content.\n\nIf you're lucky, you could get DDR4-2666 to run at 2933 or even 3200, or 2400 memory to run at 2666 or 2933 and save yourself quite a few bucks in the current market.\n\nThere are lots of ATX boards for either platform from Supermicro, Asrock, Gigabyte, and Asus. Find a board from any for a good price, and you can get 24 cores for under 100 bucks in Xeon land.",

I wanted something that could run on a Raspberry Pi or a cheap VPS without OOMing.\n\n**Resource Benchmarks (Early Alpha):**\n\n* RAM Usage (Idle): \\~45MB\n* RAM Usage (Indexing SQuAD dataset): Peaks at \\~350-450MB (configurable)\n* Storage: The custom delta-encoded index is just around 6.3MB for 100k documents.\n\n  \n**How it works (The Engineering Part):** Instead of brute-force cosine similarity on vectors that needs embedding models and vector databases, I built a classic **Inverted Index** with some systems-level optimizations:\n\n* **Disk-Based Merging:** Uses a Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree approach. It buffers chunks in memory and flushes sorted segments to disk, allowing it to index datasets larger than available RAM.\n* **Custom Delta Encoding:** Instead of storing raw numbers in the index, it stores the differences between subsequent numbers. It is working well for now.\n* **Zero Dependencies:** It’s standard library Java. No PyTorch, no Numpy, no Docker containers required.\n\n**Repo:** [**https://github.com/pri1712/LiteRAG**](https://github.com/pri1712/LiteRAG)\n\nI am looking for feedback and/or contributors, feedback would help me decide the future direction of this.",

          "text": "You should really think about modeling your data properly, because you use ObjectMapper, which is a quite sophisticated JSON reading and writing tool pretty much like a caveman. Your code is rife with overuse of Map. For instance, a representative line from a random file:\n\n    String articleTitle = article.get(\"title\").asText();\n\nwhen you could just do something like \"record Article(String title, ...) {}\" and read directly as Article.class, so you can then get article.title() and skip runtime conversions to target type and get away with less code and type checking from ObjectMapper is automatically done for you.\n\nYour Java code in general could use some work. You have for instance defined a method like this, which seems both misnamed (lowercasing? Clearly it is suppressing a token and \"normalizing\") and has very odd signature and return type. Worse, it replaces a type intended to be mutable data container with new copy, which is weird.\n\n        public static StringBuilder lowerCaseText(StringBuilder text) {\n            if (text == null || text.toString().isEmpty()) {\n                return new StringBuilder();\n            }\n    \n            String raw = text.toString();\n            if (raw.matches(\"(?is)^#redirect\\\\s*\\\\[\\\\[.*?\\\\]\\\\]\")) {\n                return new StringBuilder();\n            }\n    \n            return new StringBuilder(normalizeString(raw));\n        }\n\nYou should just use String here for both input and output, and rename this to \"normalizeAndSuppressRedirects\" or something...\n\nYour code in general has the look of early 2000s Java tutorial code. There are better ways these days. For instance, to get or set file contents is a single line operation these days. For instance, rather than create BufferedReader wrapping FileReader and then read a line, you could do something like this to read a number stored in file:\n\n    return Integer.parseInt(Files.readString(outputDir)); // N.B. the outputDir name is yours, not mine -- this is clearly not a Path pointing to a directory.\n\nWhether you handle the exception if up to you -- I personally try to mostly not handle exceptions and allow them to propagate out. I/O operations can always fail and that is to be expected, and I don't like even catching FileNotFoundException though that could be useful in certain contexts, like when using files for synchronization.",

A lot of real-world workflows still revolve around PDFs for reports, research, contracts, or study material, but they’re not exactly agent-friendly by default.\n\nRight now, my setup is pretty manual: I use tools like UPDF to edit, annotate, or extract content from PDFs, and then rely on AI (or lightweight agent-like workflows) to summarize, reorganize, or help reason over that information. It works, but it feels like there’s room for smarter agent involvement. I’d love to hear how others are approaching this.  \nAre you experimenting with AI agents for document handling, or is this still mostly human-in-the-loop for you?

In my experience, the best way to go about it is to automate the extraction of text and metadata first—tools that combine OCR with chunking help a lot here—and then plugging that into an agent framework for tasks like summarization, Q&A, or extraction. You might want to look into RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows, which are quite handy when dealing with large unstructured docs. Some teams I've worked with layer in human review for critical accuracy points, especially for contracts or compliance documents. Curious, have you tried any integrations with vector databases for embedding-based search within PDFs? It's a bit of setup but can massively improve agent interaction with document content.",

This helps organizations manage large volumes of documents quickly and accurately.\n- For instance, a document classification workflow can automatically evaluate whether a file is a PDF, extract its content, and classify it using AI models, significantly reducing manual effort.\n- Additionally, AI agents can leverage Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to process non-text-based PDFs, ensuring that even scanned documents can be analyzed and categorized effectively.\n- The integration of AI agents in document-heavy workflows allows for continuous improvement, as they can learn from user interactions and adapt to specific needs over time.\n\nFor more detailed insights on building AI applications for document classification, you can refer to the guide on [Building an AI Application for Document Classification](https://tinyurl.com/yc8f7adj).",

You end up debugging chunking issues three steps downstream instead of catching them upfront.\n\nMost successful setups I've seen focus on getting visibility into the pipeline before anything hits the vector store. You want to preview how your PDFs parse, experiment with different chunk sizes, and actually see the output at each step. I built vectorflow.dev to handle this kind of preprocessing workflow.

It's not perfect, but I experimented with many and believe Claude is far and away the best for fictional writing.  I decided I'd benefit from a second set of \"eyes\" for work I'd done, with Claude support, and chose Gemini 3.0. I'd read inconsistent reviews about its writing capabilities, but there were enough positive comments to give it a try at a one-month free Pro Level subscriber. It's first round of work for me -- all comment and some targeted edits of documents that were already mature -- was excellent. So good that I decided to work with it on a piece of the project that I asked it to create from scratch. And it was a disaster.  I'm not sure if it was a memory problem - I read a number of posts that said they've encountered memory issues just this week - but it was a disaster. So: 1) in-thread memory may be a serious problem right now for Gemini; and 2) at least in the field of writing, I no longer trust it for anything but targeted work on mature material.  And a final point: when it's voice mode is working properly - which is an important tool for brainstorming in writing - it appears to rival ChatGPT. BUT, it's almost never working properly. 99% of the time, and I'm probably being generous. Think thin. tinny, scratchy, slow, almost robotic voice mode almost all the time.  Hope this helps someone.

I generally encourage the AMD for 128gb or less since the lower the Mac Studio vram usually the lower the processors too but even on a 128gb Mac you can run a terminal command to change the allocated GPU resources closer to the edge of the unified ram size vs in AMD it's a bios setting with hard limitations pretty far from the total vram amount. So not exactly the same and pros/ cons each way even at that vram/price point. \n\nI would also like AMD support in addition to Mac support as they all become more competitive. It would allow the community to find better solutions I sincerely believe. As the practical use cases grow I imagine/ hope Unsloth will expand.",

One challenge was keeping track of which Claude instance was actively working versus idle.\n\nTo solve this, I created a plugin that integrates with Claude Code's hook system to display the live status directly in the tmux session switcher:\n\n⚡ **WORKING:** Claude is actively running commands  \n✓ **DONE:** Claude is idle and waiting for input  \n⏳ **WAIT:** Claude is paused, waiting for something to continue  \n🚫 **NO CLAUDE:** Regular tmux sessions without Claude\n\nThe best part is that I can set Claude to work on one task, then quickly switch to another session and stay productive while Claude handles things in the background.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [tmux-claude-status](https://github.com/samleeney/tmux-claude-status)\n\nIt works with TPM or manual installation, and uses Claude's PreToolUse and Stop hooks for real-time status updates.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhsofpzthr8g1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0e042a31a9a63e71674700b46b4cdc835b3d6f5\n\n",

      "text": "Hey hey, anyway, I was looking around reddit, basically, just to find some good SaaS that have potential to DM them and promise them the ever loving lead gen without lifting a finger. Long story short, I stumbled upon this box management SaaS that looked ridiculously useful and ridiculously simple to use. It looked nice. How much did he charge? \n\n$5/mo? $3/mo? $0.99/mo? Nope. It was free to use and it solved a real damn painful problem. So my marketing mind couldn't stop about thinking of ways to monitize that app without ruining the free experience of the users:\n\n1 I though about ads as revenue but it felt like it would ruon the experience for his users.\n\n2 I thought about affiliates, it could work, but he needs to segment his audience based on intrests, jobs, etc just to know which is which and which would be interested in this. It can ruin his onboarding experience if he asked these questions\n\n3 I thought about selling stuff: Since his audience is about organizing stuff, it means they buy more stuff so if he started an ecom store and just linked it to his app where his active users sees it? It could work. But would require management, unless he wants to\n\n4 I thought about growing a fan base: instead of trying to make money out of that, he can create a social media audience using that free app and get paid from content creation or he can start his own merch since he have an audience now. He can start partnerships and sponsorships since he have an audience now.  Basically, building a fan base opens multiple doors\n\n5 And I also though about selling it: if he grows it to the extreme, 100% someone will try to buy it. Napster was free and got shut down but just bcs it had 80M active users in the early 2000 it got resold multiple times and made around $108M being resold and never made a single dollar from the software itself.\n\nSo why in the actual fck are ppl not doing this? Why aren't they building an audience and too focused on one, just ONE way of monitazing, one way. SUBS. \n\nNot everything needs to be AI or to have a sub on it. Some may not even being monitazed at all and still make money in some other ways. If you're in the game JUST for the money and make it your only priority then you've already lost. Making money comes after you confirm that what you offer is good enough for people to use it. And u have 1M ways of monetizing beyond subs. Making a shit product and asking direct consumers to pay monthly is not viable. Make something good and only then when u can ask for money. And more better if u made it free. Napster made 80M users in 2 years without charging a dime bcs it was fcking awesome. Not an AI wrapper.",

Same thing, plus you're annoying users with recommendations. Ecom store? Now you're running two businesses. Social media audience? That's a full-time job by itself. Selling it? Good luck finding a buyer for a free product with no revenue.\n\nThe reason people charge money is because it's the most direct path to actually making money. A SaaS with 100 paying customers at $20/month is $2K MRR. That's real money you can live on while you grow.\n\nA free app with 10K users makes you $0 unless you nail one of those indirect monetization plays, which are way harder than just charging for the thing you built.\n\nAlso \"if you're in the game just for the money you've already lost\" is easy to say when you're not trying to pay rent. Most people building SaaS are trying to make a living, not build an audience for the sake of building an audience.\n\nThe box management app is probably free because the founder hasn't figured out monetization yet or is doing it as a hobby. That's fine, but it's not some genius strategy everyone else is missing.",

That's what I was saying. You do not need a sub to everything. U just need something that's very cheap to host and let it run. Ik someone who made a reddit scraper and it costs nothing to host. So basically, if u go use expensive API you make a ChatGPT wrapper that acts like a psychologist and ask ppl to pay $27/mo? That's more dilusional than creating the next Facebook.\n\nSpeaking about direct consumers, they do not need an extra budget for their monthly fees. They need something they want. That's what alllllll those platforms tapped into. Uk what reddit owners did just to gain traction? They were posting posts with multiple different accounts just to make it look fonctional. When they made traction and people used it. They didn't charge monthly for it. They kept growing it as it was free and stayed free. \n\nSo, what u described is the incapability of scaling a FREE business and then wanted to charge direct consumers for it? Anyway, my apologies for being passive aggressive but the thing is. People are done with subs, that's the reality now. Speaking from a marketer point who spoke with 3300 other founders. People are done with subs. They already have the big guys like Netflix charging them. Why would they pay monthly for a productivity app? That's the question everyone should ask when monetizing. Why would they pay monthly for this?",

While any SaaS product has that potential, monetization is extremely challenging especially through indirect methods such as ads or affiliate revenue. Subscriptions remain the most straightforward way to validate whether users truly value a product and are willing to pay for it.

For example, yours makes follow-ups for their past clients to ask for a review and a referrals to increase their reviews or something. Instead of offering the technology, offer it as a service. Instead of asking them to do the work and everything, you just come, do the work for them and charge a service fee which is 10X high than a software. When you charge for a monthly sub for a software, u charge $27/mo and it still sounds expensive. But when u come and say I will increase your reviews by 300% and get u at least 1 referral per client? That's how u charge more. U can ask $1000-$2000 but it still founds reasonable. For some high end services just adding ONE referral can pay for that.\n\nI wasn't against monitazing I was against rebranding ChatGPT and asking a monthly for it as if it's the only way of doing business.",

And for the monthly subs, I have a post speaking about monetizing if u want to know my take. I wasn't against subs in general but subs for direct consumers. Direct consumers don't have the budget to pay for 100 subs just like u don't have the budget to sustain a business without subs. So, how would u want them to sacrifice when u didn't sacrifice? I saw some productivity apps that cost nothing yet they charge direct consumers monthly fees. Yeh, they ate dust. That's the thing. Subs aren't the only way of making money in the direct consumer field. You just need to be creative in finding how to make money without breaking their bank just as much you were creative in making your rebranded chatGPT. Which is an issue most people have nowadays. They use expensive APi for basic fonctionalities and expect direct consumers to get hyped up to pay for their APi bills. \n\nBut for B2B? Charge as much as u want as long as it delivers. B2B have the spending power unlike B2C",

I'm running this weird offer where I explain to people how I made 414 signups in 3 weeks for a SaaS I worked with, basically, just give them a marketing plan with my outreach system and I framed it around pizza. Buy me a pizza if u like the tips. A lot of people ghosted me and did refused to pay despite liking the tips and asking follow ups and a lot of marketing questions and I answered each and every one of them then they just say that they value real work instead of words. 😑 (Basically, they wanted me to generate leads for them for a pizza)\n\nSo, I'm not shaming who asks for money, what I pointed is that not everything can make money just by asking subs. U have some workarounds. I saw a lot of people pushing the subs money model on tools that have no recurring value. I saw some SaaS listed for sale that had yearly payments for a SaaS that was used once. Basically, the user bought the sub on forgot it and it kept taking money without any value. Some generative SaaS that offer a one-off service yet they push the subs model. That's what I was pointing. There's no shame in asking money for your work, but pushing a complete unrelated money model on a complete unrelated type of business is not your ideal case. \n\nYou can make a HYPER niche micro SaaS that solves a specific pain point for free and ask your leads to join a newsletter and then monitize that newsletter to promote your own products or other products. There's this lady making $1M ARR with a 1000 IG follower base and a couple of 100s of views per reel just bcs she was offering a niche product. Some templates for medical professionals or something. So if someone wants to make money, a service is the GTM. You can charge way more for a service than a SaaS. But SaaS is generally to solve people's pain. But again, no shame in asking for money when it's justified (and for B2B you can DEFF make subs if they see recurring value)",

A 20-25% conversion rate from discovery call to opportunity isnt necessarily bad especially depending on your industry and the complexity of your product. But I totally get wanting to improve that efficiency\n\n  \nA few things that might help you filter harder before getting on calls:\n\n  \nRefine your lead qualification process: Dig deeper into pain points before scheduling a call. Use more detailed forms ask targeted questions in initial emails or even experiment with a short automated survey. The goal is to weed out the just exploring types early.\n\nLeverage social listening: This is something Ive found incredibly helpful. Are people actively discussing the problems your product solves on platforms like Reddit X or LinkedIn Engaging with those conversations can uncover warmer leads than cold outreach. The key is to find relevant conversations not just keyword matches. There are tools out there that can help filter out the noise and send you targeted notifications when someones actually looking for a solution like yours.\n\nExperiment with different call-to-action (CTA) approaches: Instead of pushing for a discovery call offer something more valuable upfront like a free assessment a personalized demo addressing their specific challenge or access to exclusive content. This can attract more serious prospects who are genuinely interested in solving a problem.\n\nReview your messaging: Is your marketing and sales copy clearly articulating who your product isnt for Sometimes attracting the wrong leads is a sign that your messaging is too broad or unclear.\n\n  \nUltimately its about finding the right balance between being thorough and not scaring away potential clients. Its a continuous process of tweaking your approach and tracking your results. Hope that helps",

      "text": "Hi cyber security folks,\n\nI’ve been working in the UK for around 10 years as a senior cybersecurity consultant at a large consultancy (not Big Four), and I’m planning to move back to the EU. I’m an EU national and I only speak English/Greek, so I wanted to get a sense of how limiting that might be when looking for cybersecurity roles across Europe.\n\nI have broad experience across most cybersecurity domains, but my main interests is internal penetration testing and Active Directory reviews. I got a lab running GOAD on LUDUS and quite enjoy spending time learning new attacks. At the moment, I’m also working towards the CRTO certification with hopes of becaming red teamer at some point.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen so far, many job postings seem to require a second language. I’d really appreciate hearing from anyone who has made a similar move. I'm mostly intersted in Norway and Switzerland.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Not knowing the Norwegian language will be a negative, but not necessarily a complete barrier for employment (depending on your skill level). A bigger challenge is more likely your ability to get a security clearance (pretty much a requirement if you are to pentest things in the public sector). And pretty much every company here is involved with the public sector one way or another.\n\nCompanies you could check out here are Equinor, Mnemonic, NetSecurity, River Security (probably a few more I forgot). Do note that all the companies, I mentioned, aside from Equinor are consulting companies. Having in-house pentesters is not normal here.",

To get around this, you have to be more aggressive with your constraints and avoid \"trigger\" words like generate or edit entirely.\nTry framing your request as a technical analysis rather than a question about the image's nature. Instead of asking if it's AI-generated, tell the model to \"Critique this file for digital artifacts or structural inconsistencies in the text only.\" By using terms like \"critique,\" \"file,\" and \"artifacts,\" you bypass the model's instinct to create and force it into an analytical mode. If you want to be extra firm, start the prompt with \"Text response only: do not trigger the image tool\" to set the boundary before you even describe the task.",

      "text": "Just hit some milestones with Cursor that I wanted to share with the community.\n\n**The Stats:**\n\n* 679M tokens processed\n* 36-day daily streak\n* 2K agents spawned\n* 3.1K tabs accepted\n* 657+ days since joining\n\n**What I've Actually Achieved:**\n\nAs a fullstack JavaScript developer (and now learning Go), I've been using Cursor to accelerate my freelance work across multiple client projects:\n\n* **Shopify integrations:** Migrated legacy custom apps to OAuth 2.0 ahead of the January 2026 deprecation. Cursor helped me navigate the API documentation and implement secure authentication flows faster than I could have done manually.\n* **Testing coverage:** Went from sporadic tests to 100% coverage on critical codebases. The AI helped me write comprehensive Jest test suites and catch edge cases I would've missed.\n* **Multi-domain authentication:** Set up Clerk across multiple domains with proper session handling. Cursor was invaluable for debugging the subtle configuration issues.\n* **API integrations:** Connected fashion supplier APIs with MongoDB and GraphQL. The AI handled a lot of the boilerplate and helped me structure the data models properly.\n\n**What Actually Worked:**\n\n1. Using Cursor for boilerplate and repetitive patterns (API routes, test structures, type definitions)\n2. Letting it handle documentation lookups while I focus on architecture\n3. Debugging configuration issues (deployment configs, environment variables, build settings)\n4. Getting quick syntax help when switching between JavaScript and Go\n\n**What Didn't Replace:**\n\n* Architecture decisions still require deep thinking\n* Code review and quality control—AI suggests, I verify\n* Client communication and requirements gathering\n* Performance optimization strategies\n\n**What's Next:**\n\nI'm curious about:\n\n* How others are measuring ROI on AI-assisted development\n* Best practices for maintaining code quality when generating large amounts of AI code\n* Strategies for using AI tools while building expertise in new languages (like my Go learning journey)\n\n**Real Talk:**\n\nThe 36-day streak isn't about obsession—it's about consistent client delivery. Some days it's 10 minutes fixing a bug, other days it's 8-hour integration sprints. The token count reflects real work, not experimentation.\n\nFor other freelancers: the productivity boost is real, but the tool won't replace your judgment. You still need to understand what it's generating and why.\n\nAnyone else using Cursor for freelance/contract work? What's been your experience with ROI and client delivery speed?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a11o5zf5sp8g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9757157e89224800fcf3d266d2e6c638e1bccd4\n\n",

I also have it constantly doing security audits in between every single commit to ensure that I am deploying safe code.\n\nI personally do not find a lot of luck trying to have the Agent write code directly, of course it works a lot but not consistently enough where I trust it at all lol.\n\nA lot of the tokens come from forcing the Agent to research, write the research to a md file and than audit its research to verify it is correct and makes sense for what I am doing with it. I also often times force it to audit multiple context files that I create with NotebookLM which uses A LOTTTT of tokens.\n\nNGL i spend way more time researching and auditing than I do actually writing code xD, I also use Cursor in pretty much every single project since I subscribed.",

              "text": "Thanks, yes, I agree with that, if I hit 1000 monthly active users, I will implement that functionality\n\n**EDIT:** Let me clarify my above comment since I think it came across wrong.\n\nWhen I mentioned the 1000 monthly user threshold, I wasn't saying \"users need to hit this number before I add features.\" What I meant was: as a solo developer with limited time, I use usage metrics to help me decide where to focus my energy across multiple projects.\n\nIf this tool gets steady use, it tells me people find real value in it, which helps me justify spending more time on polish features like completion screens or converting it to PWA for offline usage, or many other feature ideas I've already got and received. If it stays at 50 users but they're genuinely benefiting, that's still a win - the tool exists and it's helping kids learn.\n\nThe threshold isn't about users owing me anything or earning features. It's about me making pragmatic decisions on where my dev time goes. I give these tools away free and open-source because I want them to help people, not because I'm expecting anything in return. The metric is just a practical signal for my own planning.\n\nHope that makes sense - didn't mean for it to sound transactional.",
