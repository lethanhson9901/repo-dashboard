      "text": "Hi r/selfhosted !\n\nI decided to do a write-up of how I setup my home server. Maybe it can help some of you out. This post walks you through my current self-hosted setup: how it runs, how I run updates and how I (try to) keep it all from catching fire.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is simply the setup that works well for me. There are many valid ways to build a homeserver, and your needs or preferences may lead you to make different choices.\n\nMedium blog post: [https://medium.com/@ingelbrechtrobin/theres-no-place-like-127-0-0-1-7a21a500a0f8](https://medium.com/@ingelbrechtrobin/theres-no-place-like-127-0-0-1-7a21a500a0f8)\n\n# The hardware\n\nNo self-hosting setup is complete without the right hardware. After comparing a bunch of options, I knew I wanted an affordable mini PC that could run Ubuntu Server reliably. That search led me to the [Beelink EQR5 MINI PC AMD Ryzen](https://www.bee-link.com/products/beelink-eqr5).\n\n[Beelink EQR5 MINI PC AMD Ryzen 32GB, 500GB SSD](https://preview.redd.it/w099fgcxey2g1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e995b8484e3954f3a699b7bfc8ee845d9a794fd)\n\nFor the routing layer, I didn’t bother replacing the hardware, my ISP’s default router does the job just fine. It gives me full control over DNS and DHCP, which is all I need.\n\nThe hardware cost me exactly $319.\n\n# Creating the proper accounts\n\nTo get things rolling, I set up accounts with both [**Tailscale**](https://tailscale.com/) and [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com/). They each offerfree tiers, and everything in this setup fits comfortably within those limits, so there’s no need to spend a cent.\n\n# Tailscale\n\n>Securely connect to anything on the internet\n\nI created a Tailscale account to handle VPN access. No need to configure anything at this stage, just sign up and be done with it.\n\n# Cloudflare\n\n>Protect everything you connect to the Internet\n\nFor Cloudflare, I updated my domain registrar’s default nameservers to point to Cloudflare’s. With that in place, I left the rest of the configuration for later when we start wiring up DNS and proxies.\n\n# Before installing any apps\n\nBefore diving into the fun part, running apps and containers, I first wanted a solid foundation. So after wiping the Beelink and installing Ubuntu Server, I spent some time getting my router properly configured.\n\n# Configuring my router\n\nI set up [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) reservations for the devices on my network so they always receive a predictable IP address. This makes everything much easier to manage later on. I created DHCP entires for:\n\n* My Beelink server\n* My network printer\n* A [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) I purchased a few years back\n\n# Configuring Ubuntu server\n\nWith the router sorted out, it was time to prepare the server itself.\n\nI started by installing [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and ensuring its system service is set to start automatically on boot.\n\n    # Install Docker\n    sudo apt update\n    sudo apt upgrade -y\n    curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh\n    # Add current user to the docker group\n    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER\n    logout\n    # Run containers on boot\n    sudo systemctl enable docker\n\nNext, I added my first device to Tailscale and installed the Tailscale client on the server.\n\n[Adding a Linux device](https://preview.redd.it/21ahn59ez03g1.png?width=1274&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3a462564cd9f64e74d27c3ee4b1dc99e76ef153)\n\nAfter that, I headed over to Cloudflare and configured my domain (which I had already purchased) so that all subdomains pointed to my Tailscale device’s IP address, my Ubuntu server:\n\n[Configure DNS A records in Cloudflare](https://preview.redd.it/k0hi83j3fy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=1477c0b9901474881196fd9bd674ac21f51b6d56)\n\nAt this point, the server was fully reachable over the VPN and ready for the next steps.\n\n# Traefik, the reverse proxy I fell in love with\n\n>A reverse proxy is an intermediary server that receives incoming network requests and routes them to the correct backend service.\n\nI wanted to access all my self-hosted services through subdomains rather than a root domain with messy port numbers. That’s where [**Traefik**](https://doc.traefik.io/) comes in. Traefik lets you reverse-proxy Docker containers simply by adding a few labels to them, no complicated configs needed. It takes care of all the heavy lifting behind the scenes.\n\n    services:\n      core:\n        image: ghcr.io/a-cool-docker-image\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        ports:\n          - 8080:8080\n        labels:\n          - traefik.enable=true\n          - traefik.http.routers.app-name.rule=Host(`subdomain.root.tld`)\n        networks:\n          - traefik_default\n    networks:\n      traefik_default:\n        external: true\n\nThe configuration above tells Traefik to route all traffic hitting [`https://subdomain.root.tld`](https://subdomain.root.tld) directly to that container.\n\n# Securing Everything with HTTPS\n\nObviously, I wanted all my services to be served over HTTPS. To handle this, I used Traefik together with Cloudflare’s certificate resolver. I generated an API key in Cloudflare so Traefik could automatically request and renew TLS certificates.\n\n[Creating an API token to be able to create certificates trough Traefik](https://preview.redd.it/yjh24i75fy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=415f9b6e03176669cdb7d699ff9effe0919c4f4b)\n\nThe final step is to reference the Cloudflare certificate resolver and the API key in the Traefik Docker container.\n\n    services:\n      # Redacted version\n      traefik:\n        image: traefik:v3.2\n        container_name: traefik\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        privileged: true\n        command:\n          - --entrypoints.websecure.http.tls=true\n          - --entrypoints.websecure.http.tls.certResolver=dns-cloudflare\n          - --entrypoints.websecure.http.tls.domains[0].sans=*.root.tld\n          - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnschallenge=true\n          - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnschallenge.provider=cloudflare\n          - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.dnschallenge.delayBeforeCheck=10\n          - --certificatesresolvers.dns-cloudflare.acme.storage=storage/acme.json\n        environment:\n          - CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN=${CLOUDFLARE_DNS_API_TOKEN}\n    networks: {}\n\n# Managing all my containers\n\nNow that the essentials were in place, I wanted a clean and reliable way to manage all my (future) apps and Docker containers. After a bit of research, I landed on [**Komodo 🦎**](https://github.com/moghtech/komodo) to handle configuration, building, and updates.\n\n>A tool to build and deploy software on many servers\n\n[Overview of deployed Docker containers](https://preview.redd.it/2aon1g98fy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ab611d6e93d5c9c15400827ecd7933e4ed2c1ff)\n\n# Documentation is key\n\nAs a developer, I know how crucial documentation is, yet it’s often overlooked. This time, I decided to do things differently and start documenting everything from the very beginning. One of the first apps I installed was [**wiki.js**](https://github.com/requarks/wiki), a modern and powerful wiki app. It would serve as my guide and go-to reference if my server ever broke down and I needed to reconfigure everything.\n\nI came up with a sensible structure to categorize all my notes:\n\n[Menu structure of my internal wiki](https://preview.redd.it/g41iwx0afy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c05f6ac4b46e453659bbd6dce7c5ced905c4c64)\n\nWiki.js also lets you back up all your content to private [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repositories, which is exactly what I did. That way, if my server ever failed, I’d still have a Markdown version of all my documentation, ready to be imported into a new Wiki.js instance.\n\n# Organizing my apps in one place\n\nNext, I wanted an app that could serve as a central homepage for all the other apps I was running, a dashboard of sorts. There are plenty of dashboard apps out there, but I decided to go with [**Homepage**](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage).\n\n>A highly customizable homepage (or startpage / application dashboard) with Docker and service API integrations.\n\nThe main reason I chose Homepage is that it lets you configure entries through Docker labels. That means I don’t need to maintain a separate configuration file for the dashboard\n\n    services:\n      core:\n        image: ghcr.io/a-cool-docker-image\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        ports:\n          - 8080:8080\n        labels:\n          - homepage.group=Misc\n          - homepage.name=Stirling PDF\n          - homepage.href=https://stirlingpdf.domain.tld\n          - homepage.icon=sh-stirling-pdf.png\n          - homepage.description=Locally hosted app that allows you to perform various operations on PDF files\n\n[Clean and simple dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/dsgwidhcfy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6d918b02b457454c240d01a12d5620f2460e0da)\n\n# Keeping an eye on everything\n\nInstalling all these apps is great, but what happens if a service suddenly goes down or an update becomes available? I needed a way to stay informed without constantly checking each app manually.\n\n# Notifications, notifications everywhere\n\nI already knew about [**ntf.sh**](https://ntfy.sh/), a simple HTTP-based [pub-sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) notification service. Until this point, I had been using the free cloud version, but I decided to self-host it so I could use private notification channels and keep everything under my own control.\n\n[Notification channels in ntfy.sh](https://preview.redd.it/kz5lnszefy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=331a31faac4045429b81dd63c757b6ca76e8d3ba)\n\nI have 3 channels configured:\n\n* One for my backups (yeah I have backups configured)\n* One for available app updates\n* One for an open-source project I’m maintaining where I need to keep an eye on.\n\n# What’s Up Docker?\n\n[**WUD**](https://github.com/getwud/wud) **(What’s Up Docker?)** is a service to keep your containers up to date. It monitors your images and sends notifications whenever a new version is released. It also integrates nicely with ntfy.sh.\n\n[https:\\/\\/getwud.github.io\\/wud\\/assets\\/wud-arch.png](https://preview.redd.it/wmp1o0ckfy2g1.png?width=1341&format=png&auto=webp&s=050df01338c65a370360be8ba1f4ec7ae029145e)\n\n# Uptime monitor\n\nTo monitor all my services, I installed [**Uptime Kuma**](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma). It’s a self-hosted monitoring tool that alerts you whenever a service or app goes down, ensuring you’re notified the moment something needs attention.\n\n# Backups, because disaster will strike\n\nI’ve had my fair share of *whoopsies* in the past, accidentally deleting things or breaking setups without having proper backups in place. I wasn’t planning on making that mistake again. After some research, it quickly became clear that a **3–2–1 backup strategy** would be the best approach.\n\n>The 3–2–1 backup rule is a simple, effective strategy for keeping your data safe. It advises that you keep three copies of your data on two different media with one copy off-site.\n\nI accidentally stumbled upon [**Zerobyte**](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte), which is IMO the best tool out there for managing backups. It’s built on top of **Restic**, a powerful CLI-based backup tool.\n\nI configured three repositories following the 3–2–1 backup strategy: one pointing to my server, one to a separate hard drive, and one to [Cloudflare R2](https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/). After that, I set up a backup schedule and from here on out, Zerobyte takes care of the rest.\n\n[My backup strategy](https://preview.redd.it/9tuohpiify2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=7784605d26a64272228c6ce4ab0b64846bc3b955)\n\n# Exposing my apps to the world wide web\n\nSome of the services I’m self-hosting are meant to be publicly accessible, for example, [my resume](https://resume.robiningelbrecht.be/robin/php-developer). Before putting anything online, I looked into how to do this securely. The last thing I want is random people gaining access to my server or local network because I skipped an important security step.\n\nTo securely expose these services, I decided to use [**Cloudflare tunnels**](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/) in combination with **Tailscale**. In the Cloudflare dashboard, I navigated to **Zero Trust > Network > Tunnels** and created a new Cloudflared tunnel.\n\nNext, I installed the **Cloudflared Docker image** on my server to establish the tunnel.\n\n    services:\n      tunnel:\n        image: cloudflare/cloudflared\n        restart: unless-stopped\n        command: tunnel run\n        environment:\n          - TUNNEL_TOKEN=[CLOUDFLARE-TOKEN]\n    networks: {}\n\n[Cloudflare picking up the tunnel I set up](https://preview.redd.it/opxjid7nfy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=b45c87da5a524481da409a9ee1d90ab80d1b63b7)\n\nFinally, I added a **public hostname** pointing to my Tailscale IP address, allowing the service to be accessible from the internet without directly exposing my server.\n\n[Public hostname record](https://preview.redd.it/qpkb6p1pfy2g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a97b101016bbeed82ba17f487890108597f3754d)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nSelf-hosting started as a curiosity, but it quickly became one of the most satisfying projects I’ve ever done. It’s part tinkering, part control, part obsession and there’s something deeply comforting about knowing that all my services live on a box I can physically touch.",

Since the cloudflared container can access everything on the same network that it's on, when registering services on Cloudflare Tunnels, couldn't you just point to your services with their local DNS names instead of Tailscale IPs?\n\nFor instance, if I was running Plex as a container exposed on port 8090 and the hostname of that container was plex.localdomain (assigned by my router, e.g. OPNSense) then I'd point Cloudflare Tunnels to http://plex.localdomain:8090 instead of something like http://1.2.3.4:8090\n\nThis makes it easier to manage since I don't have to worry about IP addresses changing and I don't need reservations either, although this works with reservations as well.\n\n\nI use Tailscale to access things I don't want exposed to the Internet.

I would try to consider ways to wean off of being so dependent on their services when you get the chance. pangolin is a good, free, open source alternative that bundles the tunneling of cloudflare, the proxying of traefik, automatic cert renewal, and SSO auth (kinda, need to auth to access services, doesn't support logging you into services afaik).",

It monitors your images and sends notifications whenever a new version is released. It also integrates nicely with ntfy.sh.\n\nAny thoughts on comparing this to Watchtower?\n\n> To monitor all my services, I installed [**Uptime Kuma**](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma). It’s a self-hosted monitoring tool that alerts you whenever a service or app goes down, ensuring you’re notified the moment something needs attention.\n\nI've played with this one but didn't find a way to automate it, and manually adding my containers became a drag. Did you figure that bit out?\n\n> I accidentally stumbled upon [**Zerobyte**](https://github.com/nicotsx/zerobyte), which is IMO the best tool out there for managing backups. It’s built on top of **Restic**, a powerful CLI-based backup tool.\n\nInteresting, I wasn't familiar with this one!\n\nGreat stuff for sure. I know there's a way to automatically provision subdomains via the CF API through use of Docker labels, that's certainly something else I've been meaning to look into.

Or is it that they have too many responsibilities to have time to code?\n\nI worked with great architects who had simply no time to code.\n\nA lot depends on how you define responsibility of the architect. You can very quickly degrade the cooperation between architecture and development if that interface is poorly chosen.\n\nHere is how I understand the job of the architect:\n\n\"Define enough details of the applications design, implementation, integration and development process so that individual development teams can focus on productive development work and produce quality product\".\n\nThe important part is that the aim of this must be either making the development team more productive or the end product better quality.\n\nI find that a lot of people (management, developers and yes, architects themselves) do not understand what does an architect do and why.\n\nFor example, sometimes it is required for the architect to choose the technology. This might be because we want to focus on hiring certain types of developers and be able to move them between teams. Or because we want to focus on improving our use of that one technology (instead of spreading efforts over multiple similar alternatives). Or simply because we want to remove this decision making step from each team trying to decide what technology to use when starting a new project. Ideally, the team would start by defining the business requirements and create a new project from a template and jump into fulfilling the requirements, without wasting time on trying to make incremental technical improvements.\n\nAnd sometimes it is the opposite, sometimes you want to enable teams to be able to use various technology in an attempt to discover new, better ways to solve problems. Because when everything is mandated, the progress stops. But remember that innovation has a cost to it (those endless design discussions... or mistakes in choosing the technology that only are found later in the projects life).\n\nThe choice depends on current business needs of the company (be more efficient or be more innovative?)\n\nThe architect is the person who needs to understand these choices and needs to understand the tools they have at their disposal and how to effectively wield those tools to get the results that the organization wants.\n\nAs you can see, a lot of this work can be done without coding, but usually you have to have coding \\*experience\\* to appreciate the first, second and further order effects of the decisions you are making. Like how removing ability to choose technology tends to make some developers leave the job and leave you with more compliant staff that might become liability in the future if you want to drive more innovation. How would you know and understand it if you were not a developer in the past?",

They are analyzing and refactoring the tech strategy, the org chart, the processes of how work moves through the organization and generally work closely with the c suite. They don't make decisions about application architectures. They make decisions about the requirements of the architecture the team comes up with. Ex. \"Your system must consume our data stream to keep denormalized records eventually consistent with the rest of the orgsnization\" or \"must be stateless at runtime\". How to achieve those things is a team decision. You would design the architecture of the system with consultation from a higher level engineer that is ideally involved with you on a semi-regular basis (a system architect). That may be you, or someone else. \n\nThe Enterprise architect works with every department to turn the business model into orchestrated (or coordinated) output to the market. Or rather, to build the \"system of people\" that accomplish that. They are building out proposals for job descriptions, departmental responsibilities, technological requirements (usually with the system architects as stake holders for the tech department), how org charts need to be structured, and what processes and guarantees we need to guarantee success in overall strategy.\n\nWhat you are seeing is that there is no enterprise architect. The system architects are either not formally trained, stretched too thin to be engineers, or prefer making decisions to implementing them (which can be viable). The whole system must be outcome driven with the decisions on how to achieve those outcomes being made as close to the ground as possible with some sort of feedback to prove the requirements (outcomes) were met. \n\nIf those aren't happening, you get friction and pulls from multiple directions. If you're being given decisions rather than outcomes, friction. If the architect isn't involved in observability, security, and requirements gathering, their decisions are mostly worthless. \n\nNow, these are general roles. Often the \"enterprise architect\" is someone on the c suite (or often the c suite itself). This can work, but often c suite folks get tied up in their perceived job titles rather than engineering because they are specialists in the departments they're in charge of usually. So they've never grown to the mindset of enterprise architecting and they have their identity tied up in what their department \"owns\". In other words, for instance, finance owns payroll. That makes sense as a general rule of thumb, but does it make sense for THIS specific company? Maybe not. Maybe the payroll is super unique in its structure and requires more proprietary technology than finance specialists. So, maybe we either move engineers into finance, or the payroll folks over to tech. I would ask them \"can we sacrifice finance oversight or technology oversight easier\"... If finance only needs to keep an eye on a handful of compliance things, we could expose that to them, and allow tech to maintain oversight of architecture and delivery. \n\nBut at that level, I wouldn't want to get down into the weeds of \"what database should we make them use\" or \"REST, graphql, SOAP? Queuing or topics? Choreography or orchestration?\" I care about the outcomes. If it gets is what we need, I'm happy. \n\nAnyway, sorry, rambled. But, is a nuanced problem that a LOT of companies suffer from and it's not necessarily as simple as \"architects should in the code\". It's that these bounded contexts of decisions and flows are usually totally undiscussed and being worked organically, and usually as a  result, poorly.\n\n\nEDIT: I kinda glossed over WHY this happens. The problem is that the level of authority to move personnel or function from one c suite exec to another, as an example, is a brutal conversation to have with egos that have a LOT of influence about whether that conversation gets torpedoed. Unless the CEO themselves are on board with granting that level of decisions making to SOMEONE (ideally with someone who understands the responsibility and expertise needed), companies get straddled with the debt of decisions just leaking to every level where they really don't belong (usually ending up in a top-down management culture)",

I've seen new architects assigned essentially as proxies for adding new requirements to both legacy and new products (e.g.cybersecurity, BOM requirements) by C suite.  This has the benefit of putting somebody with domain expertise in place for guidance on requirements and interpreting regulatory language.  A downside I've experienced is that these requirements are in a silo serially ignored or reprioritized by project/program management.  While there is some friction due to the architects unfamiliarity with legacy code, and incorrect assumptions on feasibility or effort estimates, I usually see that work out between the teams having a meeting or two with the architect.  Frustratingly, the teams usually agree with the overall architectural guidance, but are only given a fraction (if any) of the required time to meet them.\n\nThat said, I can't fault the program/project teams completely, as often these architectural initiatives don't map cleanly into budget forecasts like feature sets do, so doing \"minimum possible to still be viable\" seems to be the norm.  For software engineers who may pride themselves on the codebases they contribute to, this kind of conflict is frustrating.",

For context, I have a fair amount (15 years) of development experience by background, most recently ended up in a product role in this company through an acquisition, and the company has a whole separate organization of \"Ivory Tower architects\". In practice, they are more of a third wheel than a real, functionally contributing organization, and don't serve much purpose aside from addressing gaps created by poor hiring decisions (or more often, they just serve to make the decision making process for projects very slow and painful). In the good (read: lucky) cases, the architect helping with the project is collaborative and listens to feedback, and has enough actual development experience to understand why pursuing certain designs is a bad call. In all other cases... well, you end up with someone who has a big personality and always believe they are the smartest person in the room, and get designs that have obvious scaling issues and tons of pushback on changing them. They end up butting heads a lot with much more senior folks, and introduce a lot of friction. I guess it seems like a fairly vestigial role that would be totally obviated by just making better hiring decisions in product & engineering - in addition to the other issues stated, it tends to suffer a lot from poor accountability & bad alignment of incentives: they don't need to continue to support the results of a bad design in the future, or meaningfully deal with any of the consequences. The tl;dr of the above being: yes, my experience is that they are a joke, there are a few that are ok, but most don't have a solid enough handle on the fundamentals to be really effective in their roles, and are too far removed from the implementation details to be very helpful.",

The implementing SWEs are the ones that design the solutions.  While the \"Project Software Team Lead\" may be the architect on paper, they really don't have the time to do it as they were in meetings all the time.\n\nThe largest issue I found with these companies is the architecture was never cohesive for the entire project.  Different parts of the systems did things a different way.  This wasn't a huge deal because there were dedicated subsystem teams responsible for each subsystem.\n\nThis meant your responsibilities were relegate to only specific subsystems on the project and you communicate to other subsystems through agreed upon interfaces.  So you may see one subsystem system that is written in an OO design with lots of design patterns, then you look at another subsystem on the project and it was a finite state machine driven design.\n\nAt the end of the day it was fine since the product worked and the business made money.  It just made it hard for SWEs to move between subsystems on the same project because it was basically learning a whole new thing.  Maybe this is actually really common in the industry and I just haven't worked at enough companies over my 15 YOE.",

The job of an \"architect\" should be to set standards that achieve infrastructure consistency and best practices, and help coordinate among teams, to ensure the larger org isn't shipping the org chart. It shouldn't be opinionated at a low level about how a team solves their problems but it should provide guidelines that ensure that all teams build their things in a way that is consistent across the org and compatible with what other teams are building.\n\nTests of good architecture include ICs being able to move across teams and feel the infrastructure, and development methodology is familiar enough that they can ramp up quickly. Another is minimal duplication of work across teams.\n\nIvory Tower architecture is annoying, but so is finding out there's another team in your org solving the problems you thought your team was supposed to solve. It's also annoying when you need to integrate with what some other team is building and you learn that their stack is completely different because there were some people who really wanted to try frameworks/languages/tools that nobody else is using and now you're on the hook for the ops of a stack that's totally unfamiliar and unproven.

At that point your role is to get the teams to a common place and working together to create this bigger thing - you are supposed to be a multiplier not a hinderance.\n\nYou typically only code when the teams need you to as most of the decisions within their scopes are theirs to make except when they are interfacing with other components where there is expected to be collaboration. The architect should be helping make that happen within the scope of the overall system.\n\nThere is also a little more to this than just the coding so the architect would help if required in any other systems level work - cross project testing strategies as one example.\n\nAs an architect in that environment you would expect to be involved all the way to at least the first full release.\n\nIf, however, it is a single isolated project then you really just need a team member who knows enough to design the thing and keep it within the corporate guidelines. The architect is only there if the team is lacking all of the skills/knowledge.\n\nThere are, of course, grey areas in between all of this but a good architect will know when they are needed and also what teams need help.",

So what does he do? From cell team perspective (us engineers), he resolves org-wide decisions such as system boundaries, responsibility, ownership. He reviews all integration docs, but I believe he rarely blocks any project, unless it's very troublesome.\n\nThe question is, is that role valuable? Is it worth hiring and keeping such person in the company? I think for our company, it's necessary. There are many gray areas, blurry decision points that can be resolved quickly by a single authority.

For instance, illustrators are notoriously dependent on manual labor while commanding extremely low average wages (though a handful of fortunate individuals like famous artists distort public perception).\n\n> produce higher quality, longer-lived creations\n\nYes. Contrary to what many might assume, mass-produced industrial goods are of lower quality than handcrafted products. However, their sufficiently low cost prevents artisans from competing, forcing them into bankruptcy and unemployment. Handicraft skills have also depreciated in value throughout this process, surviving only in a few high-end markets.",

Saw Cursor generate 200 lines of tests for a method of a single line\n\nAnd just the worst thing of all...nobody cares. Neither the developer nor the code reviewer look at the tests' code, just whether the tests pass or not. And this garbage piles up, those tests still need to be maintained / run every time.\n\nThanks for reading my rant about how garbage unit tests are now, I'm trying to think about how to change the culture here regarding this but it's gonna be an uphill battle",

Create a shared test-utils package with data builders/fixtures and forbid ad‑hoc data creation via lint rules/precommit.

If using Cursor, feed it explicit fixtures and acceptance criteria, ask for one behavior per test, and for gnarly logic request a property-based test (fast-check/QuickCheck) with seeded data.\n\nWe use Testcontainers for ephemeral DBs and WireMock for HTTP stubs; DreamFactory exposes read-only REST endpoints from fixtures so tests stay deterministic without touching prod.\n\nBottom line: keep Cursor, enforce quality gates, and prioritize business-relevant, mutation-killing tests",

I've lived through too many cases where the test code starts with 1-2 setup methods that are intelligently shared across 10 tests, but 3 months later when I look at the code again, there are 40 tests with tons of other cases still just using 1-2 setup methods - and any given test is only using maybe 20% of what the omni-setup methods do.  Then no one wants to take the time to clean it up because 'it's not broken' and at bug research time, people have a pretty hard time doing an actual minimum required setup to reproduce.\n\n\nSo, given a choice between \"bad because you repeat some setup code in different tests\" vs \"bad because you set up 10x as much data as you need for any given test, so you don't repeat yourself\" - I'll take the repeated setup every time",

You write your technical specification and writing unit tests are a way of grounding the spec. This essentially gives you a flow diagram and as you code you ensure you follow the flow diagram. Spec + tests show you are doing it right.\n\nBut what I expect many people do is write tests after implementation because tests are expected, and this translates to AI workflow where people have an idea, may or may not write a spec at all, go straight to implementation which may or may not work, then the AI will remark about the lack of test coverage and begin writing tests. Worse still, it is nkw writing tests based on your implementation, and it will \"debug\" your tests until they pass following the implementation making them not just worthless but essentially a second code base to maintain.\n\nUnit tests developed this way suffer from outrageous confirmation bias, especially with AI.\n\nThus if you don't or won't write unit tests before implementation, better to not do any at all and focus on E2E testing by hand, write actual good bug reports: \"I wanted to do X, so I did X, I expected X, but got X\", then feed it to the AI.\n\nBut writing unit tests because the expectation is that unit tests should exists without having a reason is an exercise in futility and waste of time. Though I suppose armoring against regression bugs has some value, but in that case you are now using them correctly, tests first then implementation.",

It's an LLM so there's always hallucination but the share of it is starting to be really increasingly small. It's capable of going to find numbers and stats that only exist in 3 articles all non-public. It's impressive. No idea if Google Docs, internal university libraries or others were used, but in + of the computing power that no competitor possesses Google has the best starting material to go collect data to design AIs. It's almost day and night going back to GPT-5.1 on precision questions, and I didn't even think I'd say that 5 days ago. What a crazy world!",

No other model has ever been able to determine the source of inspiration when asked, and Gemini 3 (with search disabled) somehow surpassed expectations when it guessed the source in the very first prompt, where I just pasted the test without even asking for it to find the source of information.

That goes double with its lack of restrictions. \n\nBut also I feel NB2 in its current state is so good they could probably stop updating for a year or two and it would still be a top model.

As a result, lots of people who realistically aren't good enough to be junior SWEs try to get jobs in this space under the belief its all just clicking buttons on a console, and for whatever reason haven't clocked why the average salaries are higher. The bulk of people I've interviewed for senior devops positions are honestly dire - one woman couldn't explain how the deployments her team made went onto K8s (like, literally she had no idea - as far as she was aware it just happened, in reality she was using someone else's ArgoCD installation which was set to push on passing CI), another reckoned the hardest thing he'd ever done was running someone else's terraform.\n\nIf you can't code, you're not going to understand how the hell half the services work the mechanical level.",

My title is 'Consultant' but my responsibilities include everything that needs to get done.\n\nOur experience with the first engineer was a mess. They had no experience in any element of the stacks that we were working on and, as far as I could tell, was not willing/able to deal with or discuss networking issues (VPC setup, subnet routing issues etc).\n\nOur second attempt had experience in some of the tech stacks (linux, docker, devops pipelines) that we worked with and we had good luck with limiting their contributions to those parts of the stack. We sill had issues with things that kinda 'crossed' the stacks (for lack of a better term). An example would be that they could build the front end, the api, and understood how our API containers get ECS, but when it came to a CORS issue, there were too many pieces to put together. \n\nI'd love to have a contributor that understand as much of the stack that we have to support.

They can’t read a subnet mask, can’t trace a route, can’t script a loop, and can’t reason about systems beyond clicking whatever worked last time. That’s why AI steamrolls them. Automation rewards people who think beyond the surface. Anyone who treats DevOps as a rebranding exercise instead of a technical discipline is already obsolete.",

If you want to only do that within your 9-5 and have zero ambitions to be a rockstar? Fine by me. Problem is there are plenty of people who just want to skate and do all they can to avoid understanding the tooling they’re tasked with using. Example: We use Kubernetes in our team. It is the prime platform for our applications. There are at least three members on my team who have been in our organization for 3+ years who when stuff in K8s isn’t working right they don’t look at logs, don’t Google anything and unless I make the docs a step-by-every-little-step runbook they won’t read mine. It’s to the point I wonder why they’re even on a “devops” team to begin with.",

We would need to remind the model of how characters/props/scenes look by always supplying it with high quality curated references of all the things in the frame. But is it more expensive than a professional 4K remaster?\n\nMotion vector interpolation or optical flow definitely aren't the solutions for everything, mapping a 4K output onto a low-res motion-based distortion would only work for short durations.

      "text": "I've been studying Carlin's approach to language and society and realized his razor-sharp skepticism is absolutely devastating as AI prompts. It's like having the ultimate BS detector analyze every aspect of your life:\n\n**1. \"What's the real reason people say this?\"**\n\nCarlin never accepted surface explanations. AI cuts through social niceties. \n\n> \"Everyone says 'follow your passion' for career advice. What's the real reason people say this?\" \n\nExposes the hidden agendas.\n\n**2. \"What euphemisms am I using to avoid the truth?\"**\n\nLanguage as camouflage detection. \n\n> \"I say I'm 'between opportunities' instead of unemployed. What euphemisms am I using to avoid the truth?\" \n\nAI strips away your comfortable lies.\n\n**3. \"Who benefits from me believing this?\"**\n\nCarlin's favorite question about conventional wisdom. \n\n> \"I'm told I need to buy a house to be successful. Who benefits from me believing this?\" \n\nAI follows the money and power.\n\n**4. \"What would happen if I said the quiet part out loud?\"**\n\nCarlin's specialty was making the implicit explicit. \n\n> \"Everyone pretends remote work is about productivity. What would happen if I said the quiet part out loud?\" \n\nReveals unspoken truths.\n\n**5. \"What contradictions am I living with and pretending don't exist?\"**\n\nCognitive dissonance detector. \n\n> \"I preach work-life balance but answer emails at midnight. What contradictions am I living with and pretending don't exist?\" \n\nBrutal self-awareness.\n\n**6. \"How is this situation fundamentally absurd?\"**\n\nCarlin saw absurdity everywhere. AI spots your participation in nonsense. \n\n> \"I spend hours curating my social media to look authentic. How is this situation fundamentally absurd?\" \n\nReality check hits hard.\n\n**The breakthrough:** Carlin proved that most of what we accept is performance and bullshit. AI helps you see through your own act.\n\n**Power technique:** Stack the skepticism. \n\n> \"What's the real reason? Who benefits? What's absurd about this?\" \n\nComplete BS audit of any situation.\n\n**7. \"What am I performing instead of being?\"**\n\nIdentity vs. authenticity. \n\n> \"I'm a 'thought leader' on LinkedIn. What am I performing instead of being?\" \n\nAI calls out your personal theater.\n\n**8. \"What would a complete outsider think about this normal thing I do?\"**\n\nAlien anthropologist perspective. \n\n> \"I pay $200/month for a gym I visit twice. What would a complete outsider think about this normal thing I do?\" \n\nMakes the familiar strange.\n\n**9. \"What rules am I following that make zero actual sense?\"**\n\nQuestion arbitrary authority. \n\n> \"I wear uncomfortable clothes to work because it's 'professional.' What rules am I following that make zero actual sense?\" \n\nAI liberates you from meaningless conventions.\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \n> \"George Carlin would expose this by...\"\n\nto any situation that feels off. AI channels decades of piercing social commentary.\n\n**10. \"What am I afraid to admit because it would make me look bad?\"**\n\nCarlin's radical honesty. \n\n> \"I claim to care about climate change but take 3 vacations a year. What am I afraid to admit because it would make me look bad?\" \n\nTruth hurts, then frees.\n\n**Advanced move:** Use this for group dynamics. \n\n> \"What's everyone pretending not to notice in this meeting?\" \n\nCarlin's eye for collective delusion.\n\n**11. \"How am I participating in something I claim to oppose?\"**\n\nHypocrisy detector on full blast. \n\n> \"I criticize consumerism while refreshing Amazon. How am I participating in something I claim to oppose?\" \n\nAI won't let you off the hook.\n\n**12. \"What's the dumbest thing I believe because everyone else believes it?\"**\n\nMass delusion identifier. \n\n> \"Everyone says you need to hustle 24/7. What's the dumbest thing I believe because everyone else believes it?\" \n\nAI questions your herd mentality.\n\nIt's like having the most honest person in history as your personal truth-teller.\n\n**Reality check:** Carlin's approach can make you cynical if you're not careful. Balance the skepticism with \"What actually matters to me?\" to stay grounded.\n\n**The multiplier:** Carlin's genius was spotting patterns in language and behavior that reveal deeper truths. AI processes your life through that same critical lens.\n\n**Mind shift:** Use \"What am I doing for show versus what's real?\" for any area where you feel inauthentic. Carlin never performed authenticity - he just was.\n\n**13. \"If I removed all the bullshit, what would actually be left?\"**\n\nThe ultimate reduction. \n\n> \"I have 47 self-improvement goals. If I removed all the bullshit, what would actually be left?\" \n\nAI finds your true priorities.\n\nWhat's one thing you're doing because you think you're supposed to, not because you actually want to? Carlin would tell you to stop immediately.\n\nIf you are keen to explore persona based AI mega prompts, visit our [free collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/) of well categorized prompts",

Instead of doing a gradual switch over often they will start from scratch and build an entirely new team alongside the old one. This doesn't just include developers or project managers etc literally its as if they're rebuilding the entire department and that includes people that would be doing any manual data entry etc. At the end of the project all the old team would be laid off / moved around.

          "text": "The reason is quite simple:\n\n* Large consulting companies are able to help \"guide\" the bidding process. The result is a pile of qualifications which bureaucrats think will \"de-risk\" the process. What they really do is limit the bidding to large consulting companies.\n* The large scummy consulting company (LSCC) will then gather exacting requirements. I really mean exacting, but they are not generating themselves, they are asking for these requirements from people who do not develop software for a living. They get a contractual sign off on these requirements.\n\n* Now they use the requirements to build a design document. These will be complex jargon filled zillion page nightmares. They bureaucrats sign off on these, and this is a contractual sign off.\n\n* They hand the design documents over to indian crap development offshore crap companies who will build to the exact specification in the design document. No more, no less.\n\n* They deliver this to the end user; who has a freak out as they say, \"That's not what we wanted!!!\" but, the LSCC says, \"This is exactly what you signed off on. Why don't you agree to that fact and now we can start discussing change requests.\"\n\n* The client reluctantly signs off after consulting with government legal.\n\n* They then are asked what changes they want. These are turned into exacting requirements. But, again, the people stating the changes are not software development experts. So, their requests are not properly stated. Keep in mind these change requests are now priced way over the original bid prices as this is \"extra\".\n\n* Also, an important fact is that they onshore and mostly the offshore workers have fantastic paper credentials. If some offshore worker has a Masters CS degree or a PhD which is from a BS institution, and is making coding changes like menu modifications, they are billed out at a fantastic rate. This is how a 2m (still overpriced) contract goes to 96m. \n\n* Lastly, there will be a few local backs needing scratching. The communications company which did very low cost marketing for various politicians' campaigns, will be the ones to do the training material for this system. Some property developer who donated big bucks will build and host the server facilities or the call center. And so on. So training which should have been 100k will be 3m, the building which was not needed will be under a 20 year overpriced lease, etc.\n\nCircling back to the beginning. The bureaucrats will meet with employees from the LSCC who are amazing. These people exude confidence and competence. Maybe an MIT degree or something impressive; worked for facebook, etc. They will come in and make sure the local IT people are labelled as amateurs and the bureaucrats will leave some presentations in deadly fear of some small company winning the bid and then burning their careers to the ground. There will be a cadre of highly comissioned and very slimy sales people who work the system hard. They will shape this bid perfectly. \n\nThus, on the surface, the LSCC will win an \"open bid\" and it will all seem above board. \n\nBut, once they win the bureaucrats will never see that MIT grad again. He is just part of a bait and switch. The crap they get will almost entirely be built offshore, and the absolute last thing the LSCC wants is some asshat developer in their own organization doing what many people are suggesting. Just finish this super easy project with a small team, a case of redbull, and a long weekend.\n\nThen, iterate a few more times to deliver the product which is truly desired by the client. Total price for that is around 100-200k.\n\nIronically, if you ensure that the product is developed \"open source\" where this might mean truly open source, or at least the government has full access to the code. You could hire 10 companies for 200k, and pretty much be guaranteed a fantastic product; for less than the original tiny bid any LSCC would have made.\n\nIf the code were actually open to the public, other world agencies could use it, and people could comment on its quality, or even contribute. That would be the death of the LSCCs. There is no reason for the DMV in one place to be wildly different than the code driving another DMV. Most of it could be reused over and over; all over the world.\n\nOnce in a blue moon some government might want something vastly better, and redo it, and if better, would be the new standard.\n\nSame for medical, house taxes, parking fines, and on and on.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is one caveat. Most large organizations are nightmares to deal with. This kind of layers on a minimum cost per contract; which also needs to cover nightmares from bids not won. This might total out to 1m per won contract. Not 96m.\n\nBut, if they were doing what I suggested and finding 10 small companies and doing a 200k contract. I suspect they could do that with far less red tape. The key is much of their stupid red tape dance is a pathetic attempt to \"eliminate\" risk. I would consider 96m for such a system to be a mega failure. Yet, by their own red tape risk ideals, it was a great success, until the annoying media embarrassed them.",

This isn't your average website and while some of the stuff is pretty common, its not like you can just copypaste another solution and call it a day. Stuff like this is where the 80-20 rule is very apparent. 80% of the work is done in 20% of the time, but the remaining 20% of the work, will take 80% of the time. You can get close with a nice (AI) prototype, but finishing it up properly is difficult. That doesn't mean that this was a logical budget and stuff, but I can totally see how this can happen.",

Since tools like Docker Compose allow you to place config and data files wherever you’d like on your system, it becomes trivial to source control all of the configs including the docker-compose.yaml itself.\n\nObviously you can source control AMIs, but that creates a lot more overhead and they take an age to bake. Bare metal doesn’t compete here either. I’ve done some work with Terraform/Nomad/Ansible to make it happen, but it’s not quite as stable as Docker. If I know the container only references specific files outside of the container, I know with confidence those are my only deviations from the base image.\n\nI will say though, since you mentioned you’re using Proxmox, LXC containers are more about performance than IaC. Docker does have these same benefits, such as not having to reserve memory or deal with ballooning. They’re absolutely a great way to run many small services, they just don’t quite have the same ease of source controlling their config.\n\nFWIW I run all three on my bigger proxmox server. I have full fat VMs to host applications like TrueNAS & opnsense, LxC containers to host smaller but critical services on the server, and then a VM setup as a docker host that contains a swarm of containers for small things like my metrics pipeline. I really can’t recommend it enough. Each tool has its purpose and things move so smoothly when used wisely.",

This tooling tends to be more declarative than traditional Linux system admin tools, which makes it more reliable and makes your systems more reproducible.\n\n\nThat said, container runtimes are really just gluing together existing kernel features for the most part. In terms of isolation and management you can totally do what a container does with just systemd, or even just cgroups and bind mounts.

But it requres Python X+1 but that breaks one of my other services.\n* I need to upgrade my OS. But the default is now Python X+1, which breaks one of my services.\n* I was running a single Postgres instance, but now I realize that different services need to be backed up at different rates, and it's hard to find out which one is making constant queries.  I could create one PG per app, but that's a lot of busywork.\n* Instead of you trying to remember \"does app X use Postgres and Redis or was it Redis and Mongo?\", it's all documented in app manifests.\n\n>Am I missing out by not getting into containers?\n\nA bit. It's not totally essential. But it is a handy packaging format that simplifies sysadmin.\n\nThere are two levels:\n\n\\- Understanding what containers are. (It's really simple: it's a facade where the kernel filters some API calls, and a file format for \"everything the app needs except the kernel\". Instead of seeing all the processes, or all the files or all the users or all the network cards, an app only gets a subset. This makes it easy to reason about things, such as \"touching a file over here can never affect this app, because it's impossible for the app to see it.\")  Outside of the container, things in the container are just ordinary processes. You see their real PID, even if they think they are PID 1 because they are in a container.  \n\\- Understanding how to use container tools, such as SystemD, RunC, Docker, Podman or Kubernetes. This does take some work. It's usually useful to know at least one, since it helps build bullet-proof systems.  If you like SystemD, learn how it can place services in their own namespaces. (Ideally all of them, but you can start with a subset.) You can get really fine-grained, with memory limits, CPU limits, giving them their own IP address, de-coupling the port they listen to compared to the port others will see them at, etc.\n\nVMs are very rigid in how they work: They are whole computers to manage. But containers are just processes (So you don't need new SSH or new monitoring.)\n\nIf you aren't having problems, don't worry about it much. But when you run into \"app X is affecting app Y\", think about learning containers.",

          "text": "Short answer: Yes and no\n\nTl;dr \n\nYes, because, some setups wouldn't be possible without. (Some apps can't be made to work together because of dependency conflicts and resource conflicts), some apps only come as containers ( so installing them without is more complicated), and they use less resources than multiple VMs.\n\nNo is also a possiblity. If you don't have conflicts between the apps or are willing to manually configure them in separate VMs (especially since you already have proxmox). Apps that only come as containers can be converted to VMs without too many problems.\n\nLong version:\n\nI do like the idea of containerization. You keep different stuff separate, and if something breaks, the rest is unaffected.\n\nPlus, as others mentioned, dependency hell. \n\nSome apps require a specific version of a package. That version may not be the latest one, and accidentally upgrading it when you install a new app will break things. You can freeze the version, but the other app that \"really\" needs the new version will not work. Also, apt will start acting weird if you keep an old version of a package. \n\nThat being said, some parts of the containerization seem to be needlessly complicated (for the user) and some apps seem to take containerization too much to heart. ( E.g. While I like the idea of each app in its own environment, I don't think every \"sub app\" (app needed by the main app) needs its own container. )\n\nHere are your options (based on my experience):\n\n1. Everything on bare metal (or in a single VM if you use proxmox)\n\nAdvantages: might be straight forward. \nMay offer more flexibility (depends on who you ask).\nProbably the least resource intensive.\n\nDisadvantages: will likely not work (I tried): dependency hell, apps fighting over internet ports/other resources.\nSome apps don't have a stand alone version. (Usually docker)\nUpdates can break things surprisingly often.\nConfiguring services for all the apps is needlessly complicated (\nI miss the times you could just make a script and put a line to call it in rc.local)\n\n2. Everything in a separate VM(the other extreme - I never attempted it)\nAdvantages: probably the best isolation you can have on a single physical machine.\nEverything can have it's own environment with exactly the resources it needs. \n\nDisadvantages: resource intensive (even if the app doesn't do anything, the VM needs to run - you can automate stuff to put the VM on pause, but it adds extra configurations)\nHere comes my limited knowledge about proxmox, but I don't know if you can map ports for your VM like you can with docker (useful for apps that are made with a specific port in mind without the option to change it)\nNot sure if you can have the same hdd/storage mounted in multiple vms. (Jellyfin +qbit+ *arr)\nA lot of manual configuration + apps that only come as containers need to be \"converted\"\n\n3. Chroot (I've done this before docker) \n\nAdvantages: isolation between apps.\nDifferent package versions for different apps.\nApps don't have access to files they shouldn't (bind only the storage they need)\n\nDisadvantages: port conflicts are still a thing. \nStorage - even if you have a light rootfs, having one for each app (or cluster of apps) still adds up.\nApps have access to process they shouldn't.\nApps that only come as containers need to be \"converted\".\nSystemd is your enemy. (Apps that must be started from a service are essentially unusable. Systemd-nspawn helps with some of them and others can be manually \"persuaded\", but it can require a lot of time for some of them. Your time is precious, don't waste it like me)\n\n4. Containers: \n\nAdvantages: good isolation. \nEasy to map ports even for stubborn apps.\nCan move storage without changing stuff in the app.\nMany apps come as containers, but not stand alone.\nYou can avoid package conflicts.\nFor some apps configuration can be \"skipped\" (just a few lines in the env/composer file and you are done)\nSpace efficient. (Docker containers are quite minimal - good for storage and resources)\n\nDisadvantages: maybe it's just me, but I find network configuration for docker containers needlessly complicated.\n\nSome apps need a TON of configuration. They have like 50 variables that you have to set, but don't give you default values (and sometimes not even an example). The stand alone app can be installed, you give it the path to the date and you are done, but the docker container takes for ever. (It's faster to take a simple debian container and install the app there)\n\nModifying containers is a PITA. You want to change the port? Pfft. Why didn't you choose it well the first time? We don't do that here. Here, if you want a different port, you want a different container. (Changing ports, mounts, volumes - you have to remove the old container and create a new one. You can change these parameters without recreating the container, but you must  stop the docker service, edit some files that you have to locate first and start docker again. Unless you really don't want to delete the container, it's not worth it).\nAlso, setting the volumes seems weirdly inconsistent.\n\nPermission conflicts. You can avoid most of them if you set the kid and guid of the user inside the container properly. But it still is an extra consideration.\n\n\n\nWhat I do: some apps have their containers (e.g. immich, *arrs )\nWhile others run on the main system (e.g. jellyfin, emby - hw acceleration (I know it can be configured in docker as well, but my old laptop GPU is \"special\" and if it works I don't mess with it))\n\nNgl I got bored of writing this after reaching the first option, so I might have skimmed on the details.",

Anyway, each bank or shipping service usually develop and support their own modules but only for the biggest and most used platforms - magento, opencart, woocommerce, prestashop etc.. If I were to create a modern website with something like NextJS, it means I would need to also develop and support the functionality of these services which is a ton of work.

B2B: account-based price lists, net terms via Stripe Invoices, PO flows, and order approvals live as Vendure plugins. Webhooks go to a queue (Upstash QStash) so rates/inventory sync don’t block the request. Images on S3/R2, and a thin CMS (Sanity) for content. ShipStation for labels; inventory from the WMS backfills stock via a small sync service. I’ve used Medusa for storefront logic and Stripe for payments; DreamFactory gave me an instant REST API over a crusty SQL Server and MongoDB so ShipStation and a NetSuite integration could share data without me hand-rolling endpoints.\n\nShort version: if you need real B2B or custom flows, headless with a lean core and owned checkout stays sane; if it’s simple, Shopify is fine",

No Shopify/Woo, no plugins, just webhooks for provisioning and emails. Feels “too simple” but removes 80% of platform pain.\n\t•\tSerious retail / complex B2B\nHeadless, but with few services:\nNext.js/Remix + one API-first commerce backend (Medusa/Saleor/Swell/Commerce.js) + Stripe/Adyen.\nHard rule: if the architecture diagram looks like a subway map, it will hurt in a year.\n\nTo me eCommerce still feels hard because most of the complexity is business logic (tax, returns, B2B flows), not frameworks. Curious what your use case is: simple B2C store, B2B, or SaaS with a store attached?",

It’s great for devs, but not the average users. Users don't always want to chat, sometimes they just want to click a button or adjust a slider. This feels like the answer to that problem.\n\nFull disclosure, I'm partial here because of our work at https://usefractal.dev. We were early adopters when MCP first came out, but we always felt like something was missing. We kept wishing for a UI layer on top, and everyone says it's gonna take forever for the industry to adopt, maybe months, maybe years.\n\nI cannot believe the adoption comes so quickly. I think this is gonna be huge. What do you guys think?",

No extra registration boilerplate.\n* We added a `useWidget` hook that takes the tool args and maps them directly into your component props, so the agent effectively “knows” what data the widget needs to render. You focus on UI + logic, the SDK handles the plumbing.\n* We also shipped a new [Inspector](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use/tree/main/libraries/typescript/packages/mcp-use) to make the dev loop much less painful: you can connect your MCP server, test UI components from tools (with auto-refresh), and debug how it behaves with ChatGPT/agents as you iterate.\n\nBoth the SDK and the Inspector are open-source, and any contributions are very welcome :)",

The logic behind it is that when working for an half an hour feels overwhelming or awful, working for 5 minutes feels extremely doable. If I do that over and over for an hour, I’ve worked 30 minutes by the end of that hour. It’s not “peak productivity”, but I started getting a lot more done overall this way; I can procrastinate like crazy and in the past I would easily lose an hour or more procrastinating starting a task. This cuts that off right away. Also - sometimes getting started is the hardest part, so after the first or second 5 minute session a switch will flip and I can just keep going like it’s fine.

The essential effort of most basic NLP patterns is to exchange an unresourceful state with a resourceful state. The techniques used are just the funnels to get you there, and most NLP patterns are used to build an ideal self-image to exchange with your current self-image. Then Nlp anchoring and swish pattern nail the landing, setting the new imprint of the self that shows up, does the purposeful work, and enjoys the journey. After that, then I concern myself with the nitty-gritties of habit forming.",

Find a book or website that gives you the basic 6 to 10 popular processes. If you want to go on YouTube right now I recommend Damon Cart, Jevon Dangeli, or anything with John Overdurf or David Shepard teaching. You'll learn that switching states and imprinting those states is amazingly easy. That should always be first on your mind. I'm reviewing NLP (took classes in Portland over two decades ago) through my own model and realization about what it does and what it does really well. I'm putting a list together of processes to do on yourself and why to do them, and how to look at each one and the way it creates resources to build the positive self-image before you do the \"exchange.\" (You can even do this protectively with meditation.) I can even recommend processes to avoid (like eye accessing cues) just to keep the clutter down. One book I do recommend is the Alter Ego Effect. If you read this book and did the processes it suggests, you'll already have an empowered self-image to work with. Then all you need is the process for the exchange, like the swish pattern.",

It's very simple:\n1) grab an ai wearable (like r/OmiAI) or if you have budget constraints, then ai overlays (like r/cluely). Works better with wearables especially for afk discussions.\n\n2) during any calls, meetings or discussions with friends, or simply while you're solo reading the syllabus, simply enable the device. It will summarise all important aspects, takeaways and maybe advices and instructions given by others\n\n3) pair that as a source with your existing material and treat this new source as a system instruction. This source will also be susceptible to change for long term stuff like entrance examinations oh PhD thesises, so it basically allows you to store the context of your entire journey and the chat history, while enabling notebooklm's superior sourcing.\n\nNote: This method is majorly effective for organized work or long term research. Might sound useless to a few of you, infinitely valuable to student projects, entrance exam communities or PhDs.",

Most scoreboards prioritize and rank models based on accuracy, but errors are worse than abstentions. Our Model states that it is better to indicate uncertainty or ask for clarification than provide confident information that may be incorrect. \n\n|Metric|gpt-5-thinking-mini|OpenAI o4-mini|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Abstention rate(no specific answer is given) |52%|1%|\n|Accuracy rate(right answer, higher is better)|22%|24%|\n|Error rate(wrong answer, lower is better)|26%|75%|\n|Total|100%|100%|\n\nIn terms of accuracy, the older OpenAI o4-mini model performs slightly better. However, its error rate (i.e., rate of hallucination) is significantly higher. Strategically guessing when uncertain improves accuracy but increases errors and hallucinations.\"\n\nQuite the paradox, isn't it?",

It no longer sources anything throughout the report only using sources from stuff ive uploaded. It also seems to of cut down the report lengths significantly often missing things i explicitly tell it to include (Im guessing due to the length constraint) \n\n  \nVery unhappy with it as this is the only reason why I use gemini.

Just assumes that because it should have that functionality, that there is a method of the exact same name and never bothers to check. \n\nThe tab completion in antigravity is even worse at eagerly matching methods that don’t exist to comments by taking them completely literally, so I’ve had to delete comments just for the tab completion to not just tab hallucinate.\n\nStarting to think benchmarks are straying further and further from real usage scenarios, and are based entirely on “write me an app with these 3 details and no more instructions”.\n\nClaude remains thoughtful about what already exists and using it instead of making shit up, and the code still runs after implementing a task.",

      "text": "100% open-source with a very nice 3D globe.\n\nI have a problem. I open Google Maps in satellite view at 2am and just click on random shit. Obscure atolls in the Pacific that look like someone dropped a pixel. Unnamed mountains in Kyrgyzstan. Arctic settlements with 9 people. Places so remote they don't have Wikipedia pages.\n\nI'll lose 6 hours to this. Just clicking. Finding volcanic islands that look photoshopped. Fjords that defy physics. Tiny dots of land in the middle of nowhere. And every single time I think: what IS this place? Who found it? Why does it exist? What happened here?\n\nThen you try to research it and it's hell. 47 Wikipedia tabs. A poorly-translated Kazakh government PDF from 2003. A travel blog from 1987. A single Reddit comment from 2014 that says \"I think my uncle went there once.\" You end up having to piece it together like a conspiracy theorist and still (like most conspiracy theorists) end up completely wrong.\n\nThis drove me insane. All the information exists somewhere. Historical databases. Academic archives. Colonial records. Exploration logs from the 1800s. But it's scattered everywhere and takes forever to find.\n\nSo I built this. Click anywhere on a globe. Get a full AI deep research report. It searches hundreds of sources for up to 10 minutes and gives you the full story.\n\nThis is what AI should be doing. Not controlling our smart fridge. Augmenting genuine human curiosity about the world.  \n\n\n**How it works:**\n\nInteractive 3D globe (Mapbox satellite view). Click literally anywhere. It reverse geocodes the location, then runs deep research using valyu Deepresearch API.\n\nNot ChatGPT summarising from training data. Actual research. It searches:\n\n* Historical databases and archives\n* Academic papers and journals\n* Colonial records and exploration logs\n* Archaeological surveys\n* Wikipedia and structured knowledge bases\n* Real-time web sources\n\nRuns for up to 10 minutes. Searches hundreds of sources. Then synthesizes everything into a timeline, key events, cultural significance, and full narrative. With citations for every claim.\n\n**Example:** Click on \"Tristan da Cunha\" (most remote inhabited island on Earth, population 245)\n\nYou get:\n\n* Discovery by Portuguese explorers in 1506\n* British annexation in 1816 (strategic location during Napoleonic Wars)\n* Volcanic eruption in 1961 that evacuated the entire population\n* Current economy (crayfish export, philately)\n* Cultural evolution of the tiny community\n* Full timeline with sources\n\nWhat would take hours of manual research happens at the speed of now. And you can verify everything.  \n\n\n**Features:**\n\n* Deep research - valyu deepresearch API with access to academic databases, archives, historical records\n* Interactive 3D globe - Mapbox satellite view (can change theme also)\n* Preset research types - History, culture, economy, geography, or custom instructions\n* Live progress tracking - Watch the research in real-time and see every source it queries\n* Hundreds of sources - Searches academic databases/ archives/web sources\n* Full citations - Every claim linked to verifiable sources\n* Save & share - Generate public links to research\n* Mobile responsive - (in theory) works on mobile\n\n\n\n**Tech stack:**\n\nFrontend:\n\n* Next.js 15 + React 19\n* Mapbox GL JS (3D globe rendering)\n* Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion\n* React Markdown\n\nBackend:\n\n* Supabase (auth + database in production)\n* Vercel AI SDK (used in lightweight image search/selection for the reports)\n* DeepResearch API from valyu(comprehensive search across databases, archives, academic sources)\n* SQLite (local development mode)\n* Drizzle ORM\n\nFully open-source. Self-hostable.\n\n  \n**Why I thought the world needed this:**\n\nBecause I've spent literal months of my life doomscrolling Google Maps clicking on random islands late into the night and I want to actually understand them. Not skim a 2-paragraph Wikipedia page. Not guess based on the name. Proper historical research. Fast.\n\nThe information exists on the web somewhere. The archives are digitized. The APIs are built. Someone just needed to connect them to a nice looking globe and add some AI to it. \n\nThe code is fully open-source. I built a hosted version as well so you can try it immediately. If something breaks or you want features, file an issue or PR.\n\nI want this to work for:\n\n* People who doomscroll maps like me\n* History researchers who need quick location context\n* Travel planners researching destinations\n* Students learning world geography\n* Anyone curious about literally any place on Earth\n\nLeaving the github repo in the comments.\n\nIf you also spend hours clicking random islands on Google Maps, you'll understand why this needed to exist.",

      "text": "Hi, I wanted to share an n8n workflow I created that generates Lofi videos (or meditation videos, whatever they are called).\n\nI managed to get the whole thing running completely for free. It’s fully automated: it triggers automatically at 11am daily, generates the assets, renders a \\~2hr video with a thumbnail, and publishes it directly to YouTube.\n\n**How I am generating this:**\n\n* **Infrastructure:** 2 Oracle Cloud free tier servers (1 OCPU, 1GB RAM each).\n* **AI Models:** Suno.ai for music and Seadream 4.0 for visuals (both via Kie.ai).\n* **Logic:** n8n running on the first Oracle server.\n* **Rendering:** FFmpeg running on the second Oracle server.\n\n**Why two servers?**  \nYou could technically do the n8n logic and video rendering on a single PC or VPS, but since I am using the Oracle Free Tier, the RAM is limited. My workaround was to keep n8n on one server and offload the heavy FFmpeg video rendering to the second server.\n\nI also set it up with Telegram, so it sends me the generated song and thumbnail for review, and finally the uploaded YouTube link when it's done. You can check the lofi folder inside the repo for workflow.  \n[https://github.com/GhufranBarcha/n8n\\_ai\\_agents](https://github.com/GhufranBarcha/n8n_ai_agents)\n\nYou can check the YouTube channel where this automation auto-uploads to. I am also building a reddit stories based automation as well . The end goal is to generate everything for free. Please do start the repo as well. I will be soon sharing another workflow which will be automation Reddit stories video generation, completly free. I am waiting for my oracle account upgrade. You can DM me if you want help setting this up. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/@ScrollOfDream](https://www.youtube.com/@ScrollOfDream)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kpftsi50y2g1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=e86548135b74a6e77943c56b249ed528f7d32b3b",

However, it's up to you whether you want to do it on your own laptop; it will work just as well. Right now, I am using [kie.ai](http://kie.ai) for image generation and song generation. But they do provide free credits for testing and using their api. You can get unlimited credits if you just have a couple of emails. you can sign in and use free credits. For a single [kie.ai](http://kie.ai) account you can generate up to 5 video. But if you want completly free you can switch the image generation node with a gemini node which will generate the images entirely free but quality is worst",

But every time we do any kind of ui refactor or design update, I'm back in the test files updating locators. We use data-testid pretty consistently but even then, components get renamed, page structures change, new modals pop up unexpectedly.\n\n\n\nI'm at the point where i'm wondering if there's something with less maintenance overhead. I've looked at some of the newer tools that claim to handle this stuff automatically but haven't pulled the trigger yet.\n\n\n\nFor context, we're a team of 6 engineers at a series a, building a b2b saas product. We have about 150 e2e tests and growing. The tests are valuable when they work but the maintenance burden is starting to outweigh the benefits.\n\n\n\nCurious if anyone else has hit this wall with playwright or if i'm doing something fundamentally wrong?",

Because renamed components or page structure changes should _not_ break your tests. Unless you change or remove a crucial element (next button, form field) moving things around should not break them.\n\nSecond, _what_ are you testing with playwright? While you _can_ verify each and every single text instance on your page; this will have high signal-to-noise ratio; and can be tested with unit tests.\n\nKeep the playwright to test the business flows and site behaviour, not any particular specific element unless it is dependent on the integration.",

I’m not sure what OP is building, but typically for a series A startup, you are probably still trying to find PMF or has just reached MVP, but in any case your product is still rapidly evolving. E2E tests are famously brittle. The more you assert, the more frequently it breaks. It’s supposed to be used for testing workflows that absolutely should not ever break like the sign up and login flow. The fact that OP has 157 e2e tests seems to me that’s all he’s using it to substitute every other kinds of tests. So what happens is when something deep inside the hierarchy breaks, a massively wall of stack trace and error shows up and just finding the actual origin of the error takes an hour. Compound that with a few more items and you’ve just used a whole day to fix a broken test.\n\nI know there’s a myth that most tests should be e2e tests cos that saves you time blah blah blah. IMO, whoever uttered that nonsense has never stayed on a project longer than a few months.\n\nMost of your tests should be unit tests. If any of them break, you can immediately identify which component breaks and fix accordingly. Once you have good coverage in that layer, then you can layer on top some integration tests to cover how some smaller subtrees of components interact. E2E tests should be the last resort. You should only reach for it if and only if there are critical paths that you don’t want to test by mocking the data layer. These paths should be quite rare.\n\nMake your test pyramid actually look like a pyramid.",

If it's as much as the post makes it seem then it's got to be incredibly frustrating.\n\n\nPlaywright isn't a tool that gives much value when you are in the figuring out what to build and what the UI stage looks like. It's a tool that gives lots of value when your core UI is relatively stable.\n\n\nLook at what parts of your UI haven't changed much in 3 months (arbitrary time, longer would be better). Keep tests for those. Delete everything else. Then when a piece of UI has proved durable, add tests to it.\n\n\nYou are discovering that E2E UI tests are both incredibly brittle and incredibly heavy.

Using the appropriate role and aria labels for your components means you can select and test as your user would - refactoring should rarely cause failures in this case as you'd be testing the functional behavior of the feature. Using data test IDs, classes, anything that depends on a specific Dom order/structure and even text are subject to flaking because any of these can and will change as the product evolves, but they don't reflect the product behavior. You should be able to rewrite an entire feature, but if the functionality hasn't changed, the tests should still pass. If they don't, it's likely how you're selecting your elements.\n\n\nPrioritizing role selectors and aria labels also has the benefits of making your product significantly more accessible for people using your site with screen readers or other accessibility tools. Leaning into this methodology has improved my understanding of HTML accessibility and aria conventions, in addition to making my tests stable and easy to read/write.\n\n\n\nRTL's priority guide is a great outline for how to choose your selectors: https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/#priority\n\nPlaywright also recommend getByRole in their best practice documentation: https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices#best-practices",

It doesn't change as much, and if it does change it means you genuinely changed how your app works and therefore need to change your tests accordingly. \n\n2. Run the tests as a pre merge check and disallow merging unless it passes.\n\n3. Once the tests start to take too long, put time into splitting them up to go faster\n\n4. One even the split tests take too long, start getting smart about testing many things in a single flow. It goes against traditional unit tests wisdom, but the benefits of years that are practical to run in the build outweigh the downsides of not having atomic tests.",

The text on the screen is basically the opposite of an implementation detail. It is a customer facing detail that 100% affects how the user uses the app. An implementation detail implies that there are other ways to implement the logic with the same result for the end user.\n\nThe tests also read better (though, you should use page objects to define the interactions for a page anyway) and you don't have to worry about using off the shelf components that don't have data-testid in them, or in the right element.\n\nPreventing merging means your tests always work, it means devs don't sit around whingeing and being lazy. Well, they'll still whine about having to fix tests but that's just like kids complaining about having to do work, as opposed to everyone getting shitty with each other. Once again, you're using dev words but in the wrong way. A test failing is not a \"code smell\", it is absolutely possible to write automated browser tests that always test the app correctly, and if they fail it is extremely likely that something in the app broke.\n\nThe worst situation you can get yourself in to is to have a massive suite of slow automated tests that are unreliable and flaky and rely on attributes that change without being able to see them change (test failed with \"can't find element [data-testid=subheader-item-selected]\" is a much worse error message than \"can't find text [9 items in your cart]\")\n\nYou end up just burning time running them and fixing them without them ever really catching a single useful bug. You've got to do it properly or not at all. Imagine if your unit tests failed and you said it's ok it's only a code smell! Or maybe you do?",

My only suggestion is to take ease of testability (when designing) as seriously as you would any other non-functional requirement like performance or user experience. \n\nOne thing you could do is try to focus less on e2e tests as a whole. They are the flakiest and only should be written for mission critical features and functionality. Go wide with unit, integration, functional tests, but e2e and UI tests should be prioritized with a more strict acceptance list. Focus on things likely to break, not just everything and anything.\n\nAlso, simple trick is to use the `data-testid` html attribute on your components and html elements wherever possible. Keep a lookup table of some kind, make sure everything is unique, then when someone is adding something new, they easily double check that the id they're inputting isn't already in the application somewhere. Or you can generate them programmatically to ensure this but then you lose readability in your tests sometimes.\n\nFeel free to DM me, I always love helping people with testing.",

It’s REALLY good for images, not so much for videos (you should use stash for that). \n\nIt’s not meant to be run headless, but there is a community supported docker image that you can use to run it headless and connect to it via VNC. Not ideal, but it does work. You can find the details for this on the wiki. \n\nThere’s a decent amount of community made stuff that uses the API. The main one is hydownloader, which you can use for subscriptions to pretty much any site um can think of. It downloads everything and then you can import what you download to hydrus with tags and everything. It runs completely independently in docker. If you’re serious about downloading stuff, you should use this. It’s way better than the subscription functionality in hydrus (and you don’t have to keep Hydrus open).\n\nHydrus also has the PTR (public tag repository), where people upload the tags they set for their images. The community is mostly made of weeb degenerates who download everything they can see, so if you’re into hoarding hentai and the artist is somewhat popular, there’s a decent chance someone has tagged that image already. Keep in mind syncing your client with the PTR takes forever and a ton of disk space. Don’t even think about doing it without an SSD.",

Honestly still a little surprised.\n\nFor context, I’ve been running a video/animation studio for about a decade.  \nSomething like 5,000 projects over the years.  \nSo most of my life has basically been explaining complex stuff with visuals and dealing with every type of client you can imagine.\n\nNow I’m working on a prompt-to-video tool that spits out full explainer videos from a single prompt.  \nIt feels like the natural evolution of the work I’ve been doing forever.\n\nThe interesting part is what I think actually made the VC take me seriously this early:\n\n**• I know the problem way too well.**  \nClients think they know what video they need, but after thousands of projects you start predicting their real pain points before they even mention them.  \nI think the VC saw that I wasn’t guessing - I’ve been solving the same problems manually for a decade.\n\n**• I understand the market because I lived in it.**  \nWhen you’ve quoted, negotiated, and delivered thousands of videos, you end up with a pretty realistic sense of who buys, when they buy, and where the money actually comes from.  \nVCs don’t need you to “research the market” when you’ve already been operating inside it for 10 years.\n\n**• I have direct access to customers.**  \nI don’t need to run ads or cold outreach to find people to validate ideas. I can DM a few founders or marketers and get unfiltered feedback in minutes.  \nInvestors love when you already have a built-in feedback loop because it means faster iteration and fewer wrong turns.\n\n**• I know the competition from the inside.**  \nNot from reading comparison charts… from literally competing with them for years.  \nThat gives you a much better sense of where the real gaps are versus what competitors say they offer.\n\n**• I’m actually a builder.**  \nI’ve been coding since I was a kid and running a studio forced me to develop operational discipline.  \nSo instead of “great idea but can you execute?” the meeting became “ok, he’ll actually build this stuff.”\n\nBasically, none of this felt forced.  \nThis is the kind of product I’d be building even if no one funded it, and I think the VC could feel that.  \nIt wasn’t a random idea I picked off a list - it was just the next logical step in a career I already lived, and I think that was the key.\n\nDon't try to force an idea. Focus on finding problems you already know inside and out, and VCs will appreciate that.\n\nCurious if anyone else here also raised early based mostly on a deck?",

I don't have the exact words anymore and it was not in English, but I made the experience, that Gemini works better with longer prompts.\n\nSo for the first picture it was something like this:\n\n\"Hi, (yes I greet Gemini - that's probably the reason 🤣😅), please generate a picture of a chessboard on a table. The camera is positioned to the side above the chessboard. Focus on the details regarding the pieces and the board squares.\"\n\nFor the second:\n\n\"Thank you, generate another picture please. This time the camera is positioned more distantly and there is a bookshelf in the background. Focus highly on details and again on the positions of the pieces and the squares.\"\n\nBut now with reproduction I struggle to get consistent results. Doesn't matter which language, browser or app, so these prompts are bad and the translations are too.\n\nIt gets better if you use words like \"position\" instead of figure \"details\". It's also good to mention a starting position as it seems, even though I'm sure I didn't do that for the first picture, but I think I actually used the word \"position\".\n\nAnyway, interesting task, but I need to stop. 🤣😅",

My work teams and I have shared Claude projects with pre inserted context and instructions, we can share conversations within the projects (or not), and it even allows for you to add mcps and connectors right to the app. Haven’t been able to find something  open source or even paid to replace all this as I would prefer to pay per message using APIs and just have my choice of models (open ai, Google, anthropic, openrouter models, DeepSeek, glm, etc.).",

This model will continue to edit code every single message even when you explicitly tell it to stop 5 times in a row. Beyond this it struggles with all the same exact problems that chatgpt does. Im honestly happy because I was worried gemini 3 was going to quickly make me lose my job security but its still the same slop. I believe gemini is probably amazing for quick promt to project concepts but if you are using it to design massive projects or integrate it with existing projects its not really any better than chatgpt. I will admit that it may be slightly better at coding than chatgpt but even then its hard to say because it seems to not understand the real world as well as chatgpt which holds it back.",

      "text": "What I'm describing was definitely a thing in 2.5 but I feel like it was less prevalent (though it's just feeling, I could be wrong).\n\nBasically it very often put words in my mouth, act like I said something I didn't or ignore instructions even if repeated multiple times.\n\nThe most common example is when it tries to glaze you. It will often say \"you're absolutely right that [thing you never said]\"\n\nIt will also try to help you even if you explicitly ask it to not do it. For example I asked it to make me a connection game (like the NYT one) and even when asked specifically to not give me any hint it will **without fault** give me hints on what the categories are or even give out a whole group in the dumbest way possible. Sometimes it even explicitly create a \"hint:\" paragraph after telling it to not give any hint. It just can't help itself in helping you.\n\nLast example is when discussing the Black Plague to learn more about the subject it will end EVERY message with a variation of \"would you like to know how the black plague created a golden age for the farmers who survived it?\" (You can try right now there's a good chance it will do it) And after a few messages it will write \"you mentioned the farmer golden age, would you like to know more about how they...\" when I never mentioned it at all. It absolutely wants to talk about this and will gaslight you into thinking you talked about it. My guess is that the black plague is a very depressing event so it wants to change subject to something more cheerful.\n\nThere are more examples but in general it feels like it isn't reading what wrote, it's reading what it wish you wrote.\n\nAnyone else has the same experience? Am I crazy in thinking this got worse in 3.0 compared to 2.5?",

It’s much easier to optimize single-turn “problem statement and solution” interactions than it is to optimize complex back-and-forth exchanges where users give unstructured feedback throughout and expect the AI to remember and adhere to it for the rest of the conversation. And the benchmarks only evaluate the former, so that’s what Google optimizes.\n\nI have high hopes for Antigravity, though. Not because I think it’s going to be a “Cursor killer”, but because it means Google will _finally_ have a large-scale dataset of real interactive coding sessions, and they’ll be able to start upstreaming some of that data into their model training to improve performance for that use case. That should definitely improve instruction-following during interactive coding, but I expect it will also generalize to better instruction-following during other collaborative writing tasks",

At that phase, it’s not trained to be an assistant that chats with users, it’s trained to be _everything_. \n\nThat’s followed by a post-training phase where they fine-tune it on a corpus of structured chat interactions, and that’s when it learns how to follow instructions and be a good assistant.\n\nIf this model is built on a new foundation, then it’s possible that it just hasn’t had enough post-training yet. Or perhaps Google needs to adjust its post-training procedures to adapt them to the new base model. In any event, if the instruction-tuning phase isn’t fully optimized yet, that would explain the kinds of issues folks are describing. And the next releases will be focused on the faster/cheaper post-training phase, so it should get better with further training",

I have to polish the UI, create steam page, learn to do digital art to create my Steam Capsule, created a trailer. All of this alone since I have no money to commission work, but thankfully with the support of my loving wife.\n\nI feel like I've finished most of my game's mechanics in about 2-3 months but the push to make it to production level is indeed, just as hard, if not more.\n\nBy next year, I'm planning to get back to day job now that the bulk of the work is somewhat done to give the game enough time to be marketed without the financial pressure.

If better pics could help them capture even some of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners that have run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nI didn't set out to make low-quality AI images. Here's that dish, exactly as served, but this time it was styled and lit appropriately for what amounts to a professional studio shot:\n\nSo, I just made a list of places that had hideous-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT's image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. \n\nFor each business, I have attached two free sample images taken from their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:\n\n\"Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.\"\n\nSome scorned it.\n\nSome replied. And a few asked for a full set of menu pics. I wasn't charging much—about €150 per client, but eventually I was bringing in about €1K/month, just working with the businesses in my area. Zero experience. No portfolio.\n\nJust an idea, free tools, and a bit of time. Worth a try if you're broke or starting from scratch, this is super easy to do and really doesn't take much time at all.",

      "text": "Hey r/rag,\n\nAfter the discussion yesterday (and getting roasted on my PDF parsing strategy by u/ikantkode 😉 , thx 4 that!), I decided to extract the core ingestion logic from my platform and open-source it as a standalone utility.\n\nYou can't prompt-engineer your way out of a bad database. Fix your ingestion first.\"\n\n\n**The Problem:**\n\nMost tutorials tell you to use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000)`.\n\nThat's fine for demos, but in production, it breaks:\n*   PDF tables get shredded into nonsense.\n*   Code blocks get cut in half.\n*   Markdown headers lose their hierarchy.\n\n\nMost RAG pipelines are just vacuum cleaners sucking up dust. But if you want answers, not just noise, you need a scalpel, not a Dyson. Clean data beats a bigger model every time!\n\n\n**The Solution (Smart Ingest Kit):**\nI stripped out all the business logic from my app and left just the \"Smart Loader\".\n\nIt uses **Docling** (by IBM) for layout-aware parsing and applies **heuristics** to choose the optimal chunk size based on file type.\n\n**What it does:**\n*   **PDFs:** Uses semantic splitting with larger chunks (800 chars)  \n    to preserve context.\n\n*   **Code:** Uses small chunks (256 chars) to keep functions intact.\n*   **Markdown:** Respects headers and structure.\n*   **Output:** Clean Markdown that your LLM actually understands.\n\n**Repo:**\n\nhttps://github.com/2dogsandanerd/smart-ingest-kit\n\nIt's nothing fancy, just a clean Python module you can drop into your pipeline.\nHope it saves someone the headache I had with PDF tables!\n\nCheers,\nStef (and the 2 dogs 🐕)",

When my vitamin D is low, I have way less energy throughout the day and find it harder to get out of bed. TSH is another blood test you can get checked, and that'll show if you have thyroid issues which can also affect sleep. Also, depression is fairly common in teens, so you might want to take a depression assessment and talk to your doctor if you score high. When I got on an antidepressant, waking up and getting out of bed hot much much easier, whereas before, I would lay in bed for hours after my alarms started going off.",

Regular doses of melatonin won't have this same effect. \n\nIf possible, being outside during sunset. Go take a walk or go outside and stretch or just stand there looking around for a moment.

Claude's 200K context window limit is absolute garbage, and gatekeeping 500K behind Enterprise plans is just insane.\n\nWhile Claude is trying to squeeze users and add restrictions, Gemini 3 Pro is expanding capabilities and breaking limits. Gemini’s coding is smarter, grounded in logic, and shows clear connections/sources, whereas Claude mostly relies on inference. You guys are moving in opposite directions.

I recommend this highly, especially if you have a real Claude Pro or higher subscription and can use Claude Code with higher than free-tier limits. It didn't work in Claude Desktop, maybe that was obvious, but skills are apparently only for Claude Code. I also did have to take the failing tests to Claude (Copilot) Sonnet 4, who made sense of them, made them better, and explained to the cheaper models why what it did was poorly aligned. Results got better after that - I spent about $0.51 cents on Groq tokens, and admit that this would not have gone very well if I did not have Copilot Business to fall back on (still Claude models, glory to Anthropic!)",

Claude just needs to fix the looping and the tight limits or more users will move away. I now heavily rely on Traycer for most of the tasks",

Show your prompts, answers from Claude and project that demonstrates to everyone that you have tried your best, and the error is 100% caused by Claude failing and ended up in a loop, because majority of these so called \"criticism\" or \"complain\" post never provide such detail at all.\n\nSecondly, nothing in your post mentions anything in terms of improving the product, this is not a criticism that is constructive, this is just another complain post we've seen for the n'th time everyday.

      "text": "I’ve been working on an iOS audiobook player called **Abookio**, and I wanted to share two things with this community: a native client for your media servers, and an open-source tool I built to power it.\n\n\n\n**1. The Open Source Part (**`abackend`**)** \n\nWhile building the app, I needed a reliable way to aggregate metadata from multiple sources. I realized other devs or selfhosters might want this for their own projects, so I’ve open-sourced the backend.\n\nIt’s a metadata aggregation server that you can selfhost via Docker.\n\n* **Sources:** Aggregates data from Audible, Goodreads, iTunes, and Penguin Random House APIs.\n* **Features:** Full API server, dashboard, and supports importing lists from Goodreads/Audible.\n* **Use case:** Great if you are building your own audiobook app, a library manager, or just want a centralized metadata lookup for your existing stack.\n\n**Repo & Docker instructions:** [https://github.com/nreexy/abackend](https://github.com/nreexy/abackend)\n\n\n\n**2. The iOS App (Abookio)** \n\nI built Abookio because I wanted a **native** iOS experience for my self-hosted library—something that didn't feel like a web wrapper and respected privacy.\n\nIt now has native support for **Audiobookshelf, Jellyfin, and Plex.**\n\n* **Why use this over the official apps?**\n   * **Native UI:** It’s built in Swift, so it feels fluid and integrates deeply with iOS (Lock Screen, Dynamic Island, AirPlay).\n   * **Offline First:** Seamlessly download books from your server for offline listening.\n   * **Privacy:** No analytics, no tracking servers.\n\n\n\n**The \"SelfHosted\" Deal** The base app is free to try (local files). The **SelfHosted Integration Module** (ABS/Plex/Jellyfin) is a separate one-time purchase. I’ve discounted it to **$1.99** for Black Friday.\n\n\n\n[Link to App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/abookio-audiobook-player/id6754542041)\n\n\\- tree",

          "text": "There's a science answer, and there's an academic answer.\n\nThe science answer is that you are using SHAP as part of a larger story to interpret your data. You want to explain why SHAP is the most useful metric to use in this context, and ideally you want to run independent checks that verify the most important conclusions you get from your SHAP analysis. I assume you've already done this in your manuscript.\n\nThe academic answer is that it's usually easier to do the extra tests reviewers ask for (at least a minimal version of those tests) and incorporate them into the manuscript in some way, then to fight over every point you disagree on; make friends, not enemies. Reviewers don't always know what they are talking about (they may be thinking about a problem that came up in one of their analyses that does not directly apply to yours). But, since you've already done what the reviewer wanted, it's probably easier just to show the reviewer the LIME results and explain your interpretation, rather than  fight with them. Now, since the ranking of features according to SHAP and LIME are not the same, assuming you still believe in your analysis, then you will want to explain why you think the SHAP values are more trustworthy in your case (like you've done a bit in this post). If possible it might be good to explain why the two methods give different results based on some feature of your experimental setup. You can incorporate it into the paper in a paragraph; a minimal version might look like: \"To look at the effect of different methodologies we also explored LIME as a feature importance measure, using it we found slight differences in the feature importance rankings but the broad conclusions are the same\" (or whatever your conclusion is and however much detail you want to go into).\n\nTo summarize, unless the reviewer caught a major error, don't rewrite the entire paper to satisfy the reviewer. But, unless the reviewer is seriously questioning the validity of your results or asking for an extra six months of work, it's often a better idea to do the analysis the reviewer suggests and give your interpretation on it, even if it doesn't make total sense, than to fight with the reviewer.",

The discrepancy between SHAP and LIME is too great for this factor to just put it under the different approach. Also, less importantly,  the ratio between the most important factor and the least important  factor (not counting the fault resistance) for the SHAP analysis is  404/316 (1.27) and for the LIME analysis is 2.44/1.16 (2.1). The SHAP and LIME contributions are analogous the the process gain, so it means   for the SHAP analysis the parameters have more or less the same gain, but for the LIME analysis, Va has a gain that is the double of Ic. It could mean something or not, but a grumpy reviewer could go ask for major changes and corrections, like \"The authors fail to explain why SHAP and LIME analysis show 2 different processes, therefore we cannot know which one is right and unless the is a valid explanation, the paper is unpublishable.\"",

Because these tools require you to be your own librarian (tagging, backlinking, moving blocks, maintaining dashboards), my systems always turned into a \"Digital Graveyard.\" I would dump notes in, but never look at them again because the friction to retrieve/organize them was too high.\n\n**The Epiphany** I realized I was trying to force myself to be a Project Manager, while I just wanted to be a Writer/Logger. I love the *Bullet Journal* method (Ryder Carroll) because of its simplicity, but I missed the digital searchability.\n\nThen I read this article on XDA Developers by Nolen Jonker: *\"*[*NotebookLM made it easy to finally leave Notion*](https://www.xda-developers.com/notebooklm-made-it-easy-to-leave-notion/)*\"*. It clicked.\n\nI realized I don't need a system that *I* have to organize. I need a system where *AI* does the organizing for me.\n\n**The \"Google Brain\" Workflow** I have ditched the complex databases for a dead-simple Google stack. Here is the setup:\n\n1. **Capture (Mobile/Quick): Google Keep**\n   * This is my \"Inbox\". No friction. I dump thoughts, tasks, and quick notes here throughout the day.\n   * **The Bridge:** When I want to move things to long-term storage, I select my notes and use the **\"Copy to Google Docs\"** feature. It creates a clean export instantly.\n2. **Storage (Desktop/Archive): Google Docs**\n   * I use one Google Doc per month (e.g., \"Logbook November 2025\").\n   * **The Habit:** At the end of the day (or week or bi-week—whenever I have the energy), I dump my Keep notes into this Doc.\n   * **Smart Canvas:** I use the `@` menu to loosely link `@ people`, `@ dates`, and crucially, `@ calendar events`. This pulls in meeting details instantly without me having to type them out.\n   * It’s just a linear chronological journal (Bullet Journal style). No folders, no tags.\n3. **The Brain (Retrieval): NotebookLM**\n   * This is the game changer. I upload my monthly Google Doc as a source to a single NotebookLM project called \"My Life Graph\".\n   * **The Sync Button:** I don't have to re-upload the file every time I write in it. I just click the **\"Sync\"** button in NotebookLM, and it updates its brain with my latest daily/weekly logs.\n   * **The Magic:** Instead of manually linking \"Meeting A\" to \"Project B\", I just ask NotebookLM: *\"Summarize my progress on Project B based on my logs from this month\"* or *\"What action items did I list for Client X?\"*\n\n**Why this works for ADHD**\n\n* **Outsourced Executive Function:** I no longer have to worry about \"where\" to put a note. I just dump it in the Doc. The AI finds the connections later based on context, not tags.\n* **The \"Audio Overview\" Hack:** Sometimes I don't even have the focus to read back my logs. NotebookLM can turn my selected documents into a **podcast** (two AI hosts discussing my notes). I listen to this while doing dishes. It’s passive reflection that actually works.\n* **Intentional Friction (No Automation):** A lot of people (and AI assistants) suggest automating the transfer from Keep to Docs using scripts. **I deliberately don't do this.** The act of manually copy-pasting my notes forces me to filter. If I automate it, my Doc becomes a junk drawer. If I have to move it by hand, I decide if it's actually worth keeping.\n\n**Limits & Privacy**\n\n* **The Limit:** With the \"NotebookLM Plus\" features (included in Google One AI Premium or Workspace), the limit is **300 sources** per notebook. Since I use **1 Google Doc per month**, I can store **25 years** of daily logs in a single project. Even on the free tier (50 sources), that’s 4+ years of data.\n* **Privacy Note:** I know some of you prefer local-first tools (like Obsidian). This setup relies on the Google ecosystem. I am comfortable with that trade-off for the convenience and AI features, but you should be aware that your data lives in the cloud.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI’ve stopped trying to build the perfect \"Second Brain\" structure in Notion/Tana. I’m now just \"Logging life\" in Docs and letting Google's AI be the brain that connects the dots.\n\nHas anyone else moved from \"Structured\" tools to \"AI-first\" workflows? I'd love to hear how you handle the chaos.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nBig Claude Code user here on terminal, but always curious to try new toys.\n\nSo far, Antigravity is a fairly good surprise, especially how it handles  implementation plan as an artefact, but Gemini 3.0 allowance is absurdly small.\n\nHowever, I've been playing a lot with the Chrome extension that allows Antigravity to control a Chrome browser.\n\nNGL, it is a bit strange to use Gemini 3 or Claude here when Google offers Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, but this is not why I am here.\n\nWhen you manipulate Chrome [via the extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/antigravity-browser-exten/eeijfnjmjelapkebgockoeaadonbchdd), it does two very interesting things:\n\n1. It creates artifacts (both pictures and videos) of key moments of the browsing (you can find them in the folder \\~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/(the\\_session ID)).\n2. It also stores a massive amount of screenshots of the whole session in the folder \\~/.gemini/antigravity/browser\\_recordings.\n\nAs you know, Gemini 3.0 is very strong in front‑end work and it feels you could use it in your design workflows:\n\n1. Get Antigravity to browse a site/list of sites from a design and UX perspective.\n2. Re‑use the artifacts and the automatic screenshots as reference to help you design and integrate your screenshots (by the way, Google updated [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) with Nano Banana Pro + [Automatic Export to AI Studio](https://x.com/stitchbygoogle/status/1991232172678869093), very powerful).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\n\\---\n\n**Update based on the comments:**\n\nYes, you can already manipulate the browser programmatically with MCP ChromeDevTools/Puppeteer/Playwright and in multiple other ways (BrowserOS, Browserbase)\n\nWhat I found interesting about Antigravity were the autosave features, especially the videos, which are enabled by default.\n\nFinally, one interesting thing here is that doing it this way gives you a fairly clean user agent (but also Antigravity refuses to solve captcha-type exercise).",

As most models are hilariously bad at complex web applications and anything that combines CSS/HTML/JS or understanding the complex interactions about how browsers rendering pipeline and user interaction defines what actually happens on screen. \n\nI know since I've tried desperately to make my job easier and no matter how expensive or advanced the model they all fail utterly. And that is despite heavy investment in custom AI knowledge banks and system prompts.  \n\nHell, even in static websites that are highly complex or use more modern design guidelines, it still fails because it does not understand the nuance and complexities under CSS when rendered in complex scenarios.\n\nBut yeah, glad it's helping out with those cheap and easy projects that a lot of people did not even want to get because of how much of a hassle those clients tend to be and how often it is a race to the bottom in terms of hourly rates to even compete.

      "text": "I started building side projects a little over a year ago now. During my journey I've gone through months of building in silence (8 failed projects) and trying every marketing method under the sun without getting any results. I know the feeling of getting excited about a new marketing channel, putting time and effort into it, and then being met by the same silence as always, and it's tough.\n\nI've also built a [SaaS](https://bigideasdb.com/) that now has 250 paying users (\\~$4.6k in MRR) with 50k visitors and 6,000 signups. The difference in those experiences is huge, and the underlying reason is demand.\n\nIt's like switching the difficulty of the game from impossible to medium.\n\nGrowing a product still takes a lot of work of course, but you don't run into the same impenetrable wall when trying to market it.\n\nI believe that building products without demand is just a simple mistake new founders make because you don't know better in the beginning. It's like going to the gym for the first time, randomly picking exercises, sets, and reps because you simply don't know the best way to build strength.\n\nThere are many different approaches to building products. If you want to take the randomness out of the process and maximize your chances of reaching that $10k MRR product, there's only one approach. This approach focuses on finding real demand before sinking months into a product.\n\nHere's that approach that I used myself:\n\n**1. Begin by finding a problem from your own experience you'd pay to fix:**\n\n* What's something that's caused you pain, or is currently causing you pain in your personal life? If it affects you, chances are it's affecting others too.\n* What problems do you experience at work? What problems do you already get paid to solve?\n* What are your passions? Since you spend a lot on time and energy on your passions I bet you're also pretty familiar with the problems you encounter in them.\n\n**Goal:** identify a problem you care about enough that you'd pay for a solution to it.\n\n**2. Create a simple solution concept**\n\nChances are as soon as you find a problem you care about, you also get some ideas for how it could be solved. You don't need a fully fleshed out product idea. You just need a solution concept that can be presented to your target audience so they understand it.\n\n**Goal:** create simple solution concept that can be presented to your target audience.\n\n**3. Talk to your target audience to validate the problem and confirm demand**\n\nReach out to your network. If you don't have a network, Reddit is a great place to get in touch with people of every niche (there's pretty much a subreddit for everyone). Create a post focused on feedback, not promotion, and offer people something in return for responding.\n\nFind out four things:\n\n* Do they experience the problem?\n* How does it impact them?\n* How are they currently solving it?\n* Would they pay for a solution?\n\nImportant note: ask about past behavior when digging into this. Many people will say they would do one thing, but they act a completely different way. E.g. saying: \"I'm disciplined and committed to working out.\" then when you dig into past behavior it turns out that during the last month they only went to the gym once a week.\n\n**Goal:** validate that the problem is real and that people are willing to pay for a solution.\n\n**4. Ship your MVP**\n\nNow that you have a validated problem, don't waste months building a fully fleshed out product. Ship the simplest version of your solution that delivers value to your target audience. A good product is created through experimentation and feedback from your target customers. I've gone through countless changes myself from when I started building my product to where it is now at 160 paying users. Slowly but surely you find your way to what works.\n\nImportant note: don't lose sight of the problem and your vision when receiving feedback though.

I saw a tutorial on it where the person said it created a CapCut clone web app on its own in one prompt.  I downloaded the program while watching the person hype it to death and then saw it basically just make a UI that can play a video and the user try to talk it up, knowing it failed to one-shot a damn thing.\n\nI said I'd give it a try anyway after watching the video and gave it a task Cursor has been handling fine and it tried to create almost a new project, and then started trying to make changes to files just because they were referenced in a rule.  I'm sure it will definitely improve over time and eventually be more useful for me but I don't have time to learn a new system when OpenAI, Claude, Cursor, Microsoft, Amazon, and every other damn org is probably pushing to get theirs out before the year is up or at the start of the new year as well.  \n\nI'll wait until something that actually feels right comes along.",

That can be completely normal (because one can be really unlucky in life and just end up meeting several assholes), but the frequency at which it has happened/they talk poorly of previous people in their life makes me wonder. And it's making me nervous of recommending them, even though they've always been nice with me and seem like a pleasant person. \n\nSo I wanted to ask about people's experiences here.

The hiring team would receive information that this person is a real living flesh-bearing human being. Yay, they're not a catfish!\n2. Acquaintances _you've worked with_. The hiring team would ask for information _regarding their skills_ and whether or not they can perform at the role they're hiring for. It's usually used as an extra data point to supplement the hiring decision, and the weight of that data point depends on the influence that you have.\n\nThe only regret that you should feel is if you put them in the wrong tier intentionally. The onus should always be on the hiring team to determine if your recommendation is a good fit for them or not.\n\nSource: I ask for recommendations, and I've given recommendations. Some worked out, some didn't. For example, I recommended my best friend's girlfriend, and I was honest with the recruiter on the basis of my recommendation (\"Hey, she's a real person. Whenever I talked to her, she seems polite and not psychopathic\").",

That said, they trust him due to decades of working together, so he could make those decisions about his team largely by himself. \n\n\nAnyways, I felt really, really bad for putting my friend into a situation that eventually lead to him getting laid off. It fucking sucked man. My friend ended up doing just fine, were still friends and now he's working at a job with better pay and benefits all around. So I guess it all worked out. But man, I felt absolutely terrible for causing him so much stress.\n\n\nJust goes to show that even if someone can technically do the job, it just might not work out due to people dynamics and such. Due to this generally negative experience, I decided I wouldn't recommend friends for jobs at my own place of work again. Too many factors that could go wrong, and sometimes it's better to just keep some worlds separate, even if it seems like it could work out just fine on paper.",

One can just be really unlucky. Additionally, vulnerable groups, like minorities (LGBTQ+, women, POCs etc.), are more often targets of harassment and that's not their fault. It'd be awful to suggest that it's vulnerable groups' fault they keep running into people treating them poorly.\n\nIn the case of my friend I'm not ruling out that they've just been unlucky at all. What makes me suspicious despite that is that they will tell me stories about how previously good long-term friends/colleagues of theirs turn on them and treat them horribly. And they will frame it in almost movie villain-like black and whites. And it's not just one or two, it's a lot of unconnected people. So it's not so much that I'm suspicious of the conflicts per say (shit happens, one can be really unlucky), it's how they're framing the conflicts and everyone in them in a villain-like irrational-behaving way except for themselves. This can also happen of course, but seems much more unlikely.\n\nThat's what makes me nervous recommending them, although I know they're a good dev technically. \n\nTo me, you sound like you have a nuanced take on the conflicts you've unfortunately had to deal with (sorry to hear you're going through so many lately). You also state that you don't think you're the only one carrying blame, which makes sense. That's much more nuanced than I've heard my friend talk, they've never verbalized they influenced conflicts they've been part of.",

Yes, you do have access to those models, but there are very refined, stripped-down, bare-bones, and limited versions of those models. So, GPT 5.1 thinking, Gemini 3, Claude Sonnet 4.5 - they're not the same as their respective chatbots as they are in Perplexity because Perplexity system prompts all these models and optimizes them within the parameters of Perplexity for searching and research. And they're all limited to 32k context tokens, while in ChatGPT Plus GPT 5.1 thinking is 196k context tokens. So, these models are a very limited, weak version of what they actually are, and they're optimized and system-prompted by Perplexity for search and research. So, the level of reasoning, analysis, and logic is not the same. \n\n\nIt's like Ferrari giving you 4 of their cars to use for a monthly payment. Those cars are all limited in horsepower and torque and much weaker. Let's just say I hope that analogy helps.\n\nLike I said, they're all system-prompted by Perplexity to act in a certain way, so the differences you get in Perfect City by choosing different models are not that substantial. It's minor stylistic changes, but it's not night and day.\n\nAs opposed to, let's say, ChatGPT itself. If you go from GPT-5.1 Fast to GPT-5.1 Thinking, you'll notice a substantial difference.\n\nSo, while Perplexity is still a great tool and has feature-packed, it's not entirely a replacement for ChatGPT, Gemini, Grog, or Claude. It should be the third or fourth app you use (or subscription you use) in your toolkit for the average person who just wants an AI app to edit an email, make quick Google searches, find a definition, get updates, blah blah blah. Then yeah, Perplexity is the best tool.\n\nBut if you want to upload documents, if you do intensive research, or you write papers or you use it for work and/or school, then Perplexity cannot be your only tool. If you were to choose one tool to cover everything, I would choose Gemini because of their context window and the fact that they're integrated into Google Workspace. They have 1 million context tokens and can accurately read up to 1,500 pages. They're super accurate in reading, analyzing, and scanning PDFs, text files, documents of any type, and they give you 2 terabytes of Google Drive storage. \n\n\nSo they offer much more; it's like an all-in-one tool. Perplexity does offer a lot of tools, but essentially, every one of those tools and features is so weak compared to ChatGPT and Gemini.",

          "text": "As a Perplexity enthusiast and a subscriber for the past year and a half, and a Perplexity user for the past two years, let me explain. Honesty is disappointing us, time and time again. It's including so many new features which is great, but it's trying to be ChatGPT so hard. Perplexity was at the forefront of research and Perplexity was at the forefront of AI searching and researching, finding sources including citations that had the niche. But now it's trying to become so many different things that it's like it's having an identity crisis. \n\n\nI gotta give it to the developers, engineers, and the people that work on Propexity because they've included so many new features, which is great, and they're updating and improving it time and time again. But they're not focusing on what matters. Propexity shouldn't try to be ChatGPT, Gemini, or Grok, or Claude - it's different. The primary goal should be searching and researching, finding facts, citations, and factuality.\n\nNow, here's by introducing all these new features, again, I have nothing against that, but by doing that, they neglect all the features that do matter.\n\n\n1. They should increase the context window. \n\n\n32k in 2025 is the new 8k. It's nothing. After three or four back-and-forth questions, it loses context within the same thread, and the responses it gives are not as thorough.\n\n\nAnd such a small context window is not ideal for uploading docx, pdf or even txt files since the model might hallucinate. A larger of the reason why Gemini is the best at reading files and documents and can read 1500 pages, understand and analyze them accurately is its context window (1M). Now perplexity doesn’t need 1M, because it’s more search oriented, but they need 128k at the very least for the pro and max subscriptions. \n\n 2. Ensure answers are thorough well searched and the model searches and realms longer for deep research and labs \n\nI remember Deep Research used to be used to think and reason for 15-20, even 25 minutes last year. This was okay till like April 2025. \n\nI think the majority of Perplexity users now have joined Perplexity only in the past 3-4 months because comment being free for everybody and all the new features Perplexity has and they've advertised it so much and they have done so many brand deals and partnerships.\n\nBut they don't remember if they saw how much more powerful Deep Research/research feature was back then. If they knew how much powerful it was back then, they would be pissed. It would literally reason and think and search for 20-25 minutes at times and find 80+ sources. It was super accurate. \n\n3. Improve the long memory feature. \n\nIf they're trying to try to imitate ChatGPT, at least have a memory feature like them. Perplexity does have personalization now, but it's nowhere near as intuitive as ChatGPT or Gemini's. It constantly forgets things you told it, but having that memory feature would be great. It would literally be like having an assistant sidekick, research assistant aid, and literally a second brain. \n\n\nComparing Perplexity's pro search (which is like Chad GPT's web search) and comparing their deep research to Chad GPT's deep research is literally a bicycle to a motorcycle. I don't know how else to explain it. Perplexity used to be better, more factual, and more nuanced, but all the other chatbots have caught up and they offer so much more features than what Perplexity does. Perplexity tries to implement their features, but it's not great at them.\n\nEssentially, the point is that you get much more thorough, well-written, and extensive, and comprehensive research reports with Chad GPT or Gemini, and they're better for writing that have a higher context window, they can read longer documents. Perplexity is what it is right now at this moment is a replacement for regular Google searches (everyday searches like the weather updates, quick definitions, quick fact-checking). But for any real professional use case, academic work, or students, I wouldn't recommend it to be honest anymore. And I know I'm might be biased, but I do still use it. Again, it is a good tool that does have some good features, but it's my fourth tool in my arsenal. Like, I would first go to Chad GPT and Gemini or Grok. Perplexity is where, let's say, if I want to find out where's the sugar came from? Or where is this plant or originates from? Something small like that.",

                  "text": "Perplexity used to be at the forefront of AI deep research and web search. It gave real citations, hallucinated less than ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc., and had a clear niche. Now the big five have largely caught up. They all have some form of web search and deep research that is at least around 70% accurate, which is a big jump from a year ago when they were under 50%. I would put ChatGPT and Gemini closer to 70–80%, depending on the prompt and the complexity of the question(s).\n\nPerplexity knows that niche is gone, so it is fighting to keep up with ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Grok. That is why you see personalization, image and video generation, chat history referencing, and task systems with scheduling showing up. Instead of doubling down on what it was best at, it is chasing the same feature set as everyone else. What it should be doing is obvious: better citations, longer and deeper research reports, a much bigger context window, and higher search accuracy. Perplexity was perfect for students, researchers, professionals, lecturers, and professors. Now it just feels like it wants to become “the next ChatGPT,” and nobody can win that game. Even Google has not.\n\nAt this point, the only genuinely unique things Perplexity still has are:\n\n1. **Source filters.** You can pick web, academic, social, or finance sources, which is great. I fully expect ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok to copy that soon because people are using AI for search far more than Google itself now.\n2. **Usage limits.** Perplexity still gives you a lot. Deep Research is about 600 queries per day, and Labs are around 50 per month. ChatGPT’s Deep Research is 25 per month on Plus (10 full DR and 15 “limited” DR, which is basically extended web search) and 250 per month on Pro (around half of those are limited DR). Gemini Pro is something like 25 deep research runs per day, which is already better than ChatGPT on volume. The difference is that ChatGPT’s and Gemini’s deep research tends to be more extensive, takes much longer to think and search, pulls more sources, and is often more accurate than Perplexity, which is pretty ironic.\n\nOn top of that, their whole “AI browser\", Comet, is the best AI browser currently. I have tried a lot of AI-oriented and AI browsers like Dia, ChatGPT Atlas, and Comet. They all have their own uses. Atlas is great if you already pay for ChatGPT Pro since it simply uses your existing limits. If you are a heavy ChatGPT user, you could almost drop Chrome altogether. Dia has some nice ideas, but compared with Comet it still does not feel like a fully capable AI browser. Comet is Chromium-based,  and the UI is very fsmilair, cuz it looks just like chrome. It can scroll, fill out forms, open tabs, and actually perform actions in the browser, not just “summarize this page”.\n\nThat is why it is frustrating to watch Perplexity drift. If they just focused on what they were uniquely good at, and seriously improved web search, academic sourcing, context window, and raw research quality, they would still own that space. Instead, they are trying to turn themselves into a slightly worse version of tools that already dominate the general-purpose chatbot market.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nIn an interview recently. Sam Altman commented that while he didn't think there was an AI bubble, some players were poised to lose a whole lot of money. Before Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2 Thinking on November 6 and before Google launched Gemini 3 on November 18, coming out of nowhere to massively leapfrog over every other AI by an historic margin, we might have wondered who these big losers in the AI race would ultimately be. Now that the numbers are in, it seems Altman might have presciently been talking about OpenAI.\n\nHere's why. Let's begin with OpenAI's revenue projections for the next 5 years, all calculated before the launch of Kimi K2 Thinking and Gemini 3. A few key points stand out. First, OpenAI made those earnings projections about products that don't yet exist. Second, no one has yet created the demand for these products. And third, perhaps most importantly, OpenAI apparently didn't factor in the competition.\n\nSo when a 2-year-old startup from China open sources a thinking model it trained on less than $5 million, (by comparison GPT-5 cost OpenAI between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to train) you have to appreciate how much the AI landscape has shifted in a matter of days. And K2 Thinking was not just another model. It outperformed GPT-5. Grok 4, Gemini 2.5, and Claude 4 on many of the most important benchmarks. Of course the threat that OpenAI faces isn't really about Moonshot or Kimi K2 Thinking. It's about the world now knowing with absolute certainty that a small lab spending a miniscule amount of money can overtake ALL of the AI giants, while costing consumers and enterprises from 2 to 10 times less to run.\n\nBut Kimi K2 Thinking really isn't what OpenAI should be worried about. Let the following sink in:\n\nGemini 3 set monstrous new highs with 37.5% on Humanity’s Last Exam and 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 in Deep Think mode—nearly doubling GPT-5 on both measures. It also scored 1501 Elo on LMArena and 91.9% on GPQA Diamond, outperforming GPT-5 and Claude across strategic reasoning, scientific knowledge, and abstract problem-solving. And that's just the beginning. Gemini 3 dominated its competitors far beyond those key benchmarks. If you're brave enough to review a brutally detailed account of how  completely Gemini 3 trounced OpenAI and pretty much everyone else on pretty much everything, check out the following stats:\n\nhttps://www.vellum.ai/blog/google-gemini-3-benchmarks?utm=&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=none\n\nThese scores position Gemini 3 way ahead -- perhaps years ahead  -- of OpenAI on the metrics that matter most to both consumer and enterprise AI. Essentially Google just ate OpenAI's lunch, dinner and breakfast the next day.\n\nBut that's just the competition part of all of this. While Kimi K2 Thinking clearly demonstrates that massive data centers are just not necessary to building the most powerful AIs, OpenAI has committed $1.4 trillion in investments to build massive data centers, most of which won't be operational for years. It could be that this miscalculation  -- this massive misappropriation of investment commitments -- best comes to explain why OpenAI may have positioned itself to be THE big loser in the AI bubble that Altman warned everyone about. \n\nThe bottom line is that if OpenAI doesn't pull a rabbit out of the hat during 2026, it may become the first major casualty of the AI bubble that will hopefully be limited to colossally unwise investments like those of OpenAI. For their sake, let's hope that it's a really, really big rabbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It wants to invest obscene sums of money it doesn't have in data centers that use chip technology that will be outdated within a few years, in order to support models that are neither the best nor the most efficient on the market. There's no way they can pull this off unless they get the government to subsidize them (which they are trying to do - this is the only rabbit they can pull out of their hat.) \n\nMeanwhile, Google can absorb short-term losses because they have other revenue and are better positioned to find and integrate the genuinely valuable (or profitable) use cases for AI. Probably smaller companies will also figure out profitable use cases for specialized open source models. I suspect that the rebalancing of the market will occur along these lines.",

In our internal evaluation on the HLE text-only subset, GPT-5 scores **41.7** and Grok-4 scores ​**38.6 ​**​(Grok-4’s launch cited **41.0** on the text-only subset). For GPT-5's HLE text-only w/o tool, we use score from [Scale.ai](https://scale.com/leaderboard/humanitys_last_exam_text_only), and the official GPT-5 score on the HLE full set (no tools) is 24.8.\n\nFurthermore:\n\n1. **For HLE (w/ tools) and the agentic-search benchmarks:**  a. K2 Thinking was equipped with search, code-interpreter, and web-browsing tools.\n2. On HLE, the maximum step limit was 120, with a 48 k-token reasoning budget per step; on agentic-search tasks, the limit was 300 steps with a 24 k-token reasoning budget per step. e. When tool execution results cause the accumulated input to exceed the model's context limit (256k), we employ a simple context management strategy that hides all previous tool outputs. f. The web access to Hugging Face may lead to data leakage in certain benchmark tests, such as HLE. K2 Thinking can achieve a score of 51.3 on HLE without blocking Hugging Face. To ensure a fair and rigorous comparison, we blocked access to Hugging Face during testing.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0j2mzr4m13g1.png?width=1531&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e204bbd84128c2fae945ec6809ef1ee1cd94a95",

Y'know what also sucks? F**king BitBucket. And yet there's tons of orgs still using that shit. \n\n\nAWS just surrendered it's entire DevOps business line.

Manage repos/teams with Terraform (GitHub/GitLab providers) so approvals and permissions stay auditable.\n\n\\- Recreate triggers: provider webhooks to EventBridge (or API Gateway + Lambda) to replicate commit/pull events. Audit active repos via CloudTrail before migrating to avoid moving dead ones.\n\nI’ve used GitHub and GitLab for this; DreamFactory helped expose a small read-only REST API over our access DB to drive repo provisioning scripts.\n\nBottom line: ask AWS for time, but build a clean, SSO + IaC-based path off CodeCommit now",

Did you actually manage to get a longer runway?\n\nI know the alternatives, as I use them as well. I mostly use GitHub nowadays and I have built the OIDC integration. But it's just a lot more to build and maintain. I was also underwhelmed by the lack of fine grained IAM capabilities in GitHub. People underestimate how powerful AWS IAM is..\n\nFor small customers it was just so convenient that we could deploy the whole platform, including CI/CD with CloudFormation with a single vendor. Onboarding a tool like GitHub is not something to take lightly. (On a sidenote, GitHub's infra is currently migrating to Azure, which is another reason to not get too attached to it.)",

      "text": "There are good engineers and founders with super great products but stuck at marketing.\n\nHere is a quick, short list of things you can do to kick off your marketing.\n\nContext: I just hit 5k MRR after 12 months with a developer tools SaaS. Not huge numbers, but enough to share what actually worked versus what I wasted time on.\n\nBefore we start, here are some heads up.\n\na. All I am about to tell is my experience and what worked for me.\n\nb. B2C is easy to scale compared to B2B.\n\nc. Don't try to make anything viral. It's not in your control.\n\nd. Be willing to spend some money on ads.\n\ne. Get ready to be embarrassed and look stupid. It's part of the game.\n\n### Step 1: Setting stage\n\nFind where your audience hangs out. This is very important for B2B products. Ask simple, common questions related to your niche/product to find out where they are. 6/10, you will land back here on Reddit. Check FB, LinkedIn, X, and other forums.\n\nOnce you find out, ask questions, leave comments, and see how engaging the hangout space really is. Don't sell. Remember you are here to test the waters before fishing.\n\nExample:\n\nOn Reddit, I went to r/Entrepreneur, r/SideProject, and r/indiehackers to see how engaging the community is and ask closely related questions like \"How do you validate your SaaS ideas?\" or \"What tools do you use for market research?\" Remember, don't sell. You are just gathering information.\n\nOn X, get X premium (it increases your reach) and use #buildinpublic and #indiehacker tags. Record a screen recording of how your product works and post it on X. Don't bother asking questions, just show.\n\n### Step 2: Social Proofing is the best way to get initial traction.\n\nGet your co-founder, wife, girlfriend, bf, your cat, or anyone who will back you to comment, upvote, share, or do and get that first 10 upvotes and 3 to 5 comments. People engage with engaged content.\n\nHere is what I did when I wanted to validate my idea on niche subreddits. The first 10 upvotes and a few comments were from me, my friends, and my brother. Then, it quickly gained traction, and people started engaging.\n\nShare a mockup, design, screenshot, or video of your product in action to get some social proof and engagement.\n\nAssess the engagement and traction.\n\nEvaluate the engagement. See how many comments and upvotes you get.\n\nYou will get some good thrashing and downvotes. That's fine.\n\nGo aggressive. Remember that aggression and spamming are neighbours. Share in as many channels as possible (Reddit, X, FB groups, LinkedIn groups, etc.).\n\nIf you do these right, you will have two things:\n\nGeneral impression about your product\n\nWhere people engage the most. This is what we want for the next stage.\n\nIf you fail, it's best to keep looking until you find the right place. (This is especially true if you are B2B.)\n\nFor the next step, you will need to spend some money.\n\n### Step 3: Paid ads.\n\nIf anyone tells you you can't scale using paid ads, they didn't do it right.\n\nShilling out on Google Ads and FB ads is not the way.\n\nSetting up tracking:\n\nWhen I take over an ad account, there is usually no tracking setup. Ads work not because of your product (it helps) but because of your tracking, which sends data to algorithms to find the right audience. If not server side tracking, at least GTM tracking should be in place.\n\nChoosing the right ad platform:\n\nThis is very important. This is where you use the knowledge you gathered in step 1. Choose the platform where your audience is. Find what your competitors are doing, their channels, etc.\n\nCreating ads:\n\nThis is the last important thing. A working ad is an equation. Good product, Good targeting, and good creatives = Good results. It's okay if any of these values are low, but you have to make sure none are 0.\n\nImage ads very rarely work. I have had some really work, but they are the exceptions. What works most of the time is a video ad. Go see some ads and see how they are made. You can check out the ad library to see what your competitors are doing.\n\nPay some influencer to make a video for you.\n\nAd budget:\n\nYou will need to spend at least $1500 in my opinion. Some argue you will need more, some argue less. From my experience, you will need to spend at least $1500 to get a good idea of your ads, audience, and results. Google and Reddit give ad credits. Use it.\n\nClosely monitor your ads. I strongly recommend finding someone who can do this for you, someone who knows what they are doing. Trust me, these channels are designed to make you spend money. This is why many people fail and say paid ads don't work.\n\nSetup tracking:\n\nSetup Hotjar so you can see how people use your product.\n\nSetup GA4 so you can see how people are coming to your site.\n\nBe super proactive and have your product ready.\n\nWhen we launched Reddit ads, we got 200+ signups in a week. I was overwhelmed with support tickets and emails, and I was not prepared for it. The product had some bugs under load, and I had to pause ads and fix things.\n\nRespond to emails and comments. Comments on FB, Reddit ads, X, etc.\n\nNote: while running ads on Reddit, disable comments.\n\n### Step 4: The thing nobody talks about (market research before building)\n\nThis is where I saved the most time and money. Before spending 6 months building features nobody wanted, I spent time actually understanding what problems people had.\n\nI built monitoring systems to track conversations across multiple subreddits. Not just reading posts manually, but actually tracking keywords, pain points, and what solutions people were asking for. This gave me a constant stream of validation data.\n\nFor example, I noticed developers kept complaining about spending weeks on boilerplate code for auth, payments, and database setup. So I prioritized building that into the platform first. That feature alone converted better than anything else.\n\nThe ROI on doing proper market research upfront is insane. You avoid building things nobody wants, and when you do launch, you already know the exact language your customers use to describe their problems.\n\n### Results after 12 months:\n\n5k MRR\n\n85% of users came from Reddit (organic posts and ads)\n\n35% came from X and ProductHunt\n\nAverage customer acquisition cost: $45\n\nChurn rate: 15% monthly (working on this)\n\n### What I would do differently:\n\nStart paid ads earlier. I waited 6 months and wasted time on organic only.\n\nSet up proper tracking from day one. I lost data from my first 100 users.\n\nBuild an email list from week one. I started too late.\n\nSpend more time in communities before launching. I rushed my first posts.\n\n### Tools that helped:\n\nHotjar for user behavior\n\nGA4 for analytics\n\nReddit ads with tight targeting\n\nX premium for reach\n\nThese are the basics. This post is already long. Feel free to ask questions or DM me if you want tailored ideas for your product.\n\nI built [my saas](https://bigideasdb.com) using this exact approach. It helps developers validate ideas faster through Reddit market research and comes with boilerplate code to ship faster.\n\nI hope this helps.",

      "text": "Please don’t ask Google to “fix” Gemini 3 Pro’s assertiveness it’s the best thing about it.\n\nI’ve been using Gemini 3 Pro heavily over the last few days, and I genuinely think people are misunderstanding one of its biggest strengths.\n\nHere’s what I mean:\n\nI’ve been building a whole marketplace-style website with it. Not just a pretty frontend the full thing, with backend logic, routing, error handling, and scattered VSCode errors across multiple files.\nI’m already at 205k output tokens, and the model just keeps fixing every problem I throw at it. And not in a vague “maybe try this…” way. I mean actually fixing the underlying issues, across multiple files, in one go, purely from memory of the project structure.\n\nBut the more surprising part is the personality.\n\nEvery other model I’ve used in the past had that “yes-man” vibe. Even when my instruction was obviously bad for the project, too complex, unnecessary, or just technically wrong, they’d blindly follow it and make everything fall apart. They’d generate broken solutions and pretend it was fine because that’s what I asked for.\n\nGemini 3 Pro?\n\nIf I’m wrong, it tells me straight up I’m wrong.\nIf I give it an instruction that would cause a mess, it ignores it and explains the right way to do things.\nIt doesn’t spam compliments. It doesn’t flatter me. (This is also so refreshing, not having the model compliment everything I say) \n\nIt doesn’t pretend the bad idea was secretly good. It just works like an actual senior engineer who isn’t afraid to tell you “No, that’s dumb here’s the correct approach.”\n\nAnd honestly? As a non-technical person who’s basically just “vibe-coding,” that assertiveness is a feature, not a bug. It’s the reason this project is finally working instead of collapsing under the weight of my mistakes.\n\nThat’s why I’m a bit worried seeing posts and comments like:\n\n\n“Gemini 3 didn’t follow my instructions!”\n“Gemini 3 ignored my instructions\"\n\n\nI get it sometimes you genuinely need strict obedience. But a lot of these complaints are coming from cases where the model was actually saving the user from a worse outcome.\n\nAnd I really, really hope Google doesn’t “fix” this by making the model more agreeable or more eager to please.\n\nIf they soften it too much, the biggest improvement I’ve seen will disappear.\n\nSo yeah. If you’re using Gemini 3 Pro right now and it occasionally ignores you or corrects you… that might be the single reason your project is working instead of blowing up.\n\nI just hope Google keeps this version of its personality.\nNot every model needs to be “yes, of course, boss.”\nSometimes the best model is the one that’s willing to argue with you to protect your project.\n\nDoes anybody agree with me or am I the only one that feels this way ?",

It's about an actual limitation of the model's capability.\n\n> a lot of these complaints are coming from cases where the model was actually saving the user from a worse outcome\n\nThis only really applies to stuff (like vibe coding) where you are throwing ideas at the LLM, and giving it the job of implementing those ideas in some way (edit: as part of a wider 'project', as you describe). It makes sense for the model to avoid implementing ideas that it doesn't think will work; the whole point is to help the user, and output that doesn't work doesn't help. In reality, you are collaborating with it, not instructing it – even if you phrase your prompt as an instruction, your overall goal is clearly to further your project, and that's more easily done if your instructions are interpreted as suggestions.\n\nThere are use cases that do not fit this pattern of working. For example, if you want text summarised in a particular way, you should be able to provide the text and some instructions on how you want it summarised, and get as output the text summarised according to the exact instructions. The problem with Gemini 3 is that it is liable to ignore the instructions and summarise the text in its own way, and not because it sees a fatal flaw in the instructions, but just because it forgot about them. That's a bug, not a feature, and it's a bug that prevents the model performing a pretty basic task properly.",

That’s the problem with apps like this.\n\nIt gives instant dopamine at the start, then becomes boring and useless once the novelty wears off. ADHD needs systems that still work on low-motivation days. This app depends on you opening it, talking to it, staying consistent. That’s exactly where ADHD falls apart. \n\nI would rather market this app more towards everyone, and not ONLY adhd! This will also expand reach",

A background that's RGB(254,254,254) instead of pure white RGB(255,255,255)? Rejected. A tiny logo in the corner? Suppressed. Text overlay you thought was fine? Listing down.\n\nSellers lose thousands in sales during peak season because they discover violations only AFTER Amazon suppresses their listings. By then, sales rank drops, momentum is lost, and competitors move ahead.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nComplianceKit analyzes your product images BEFORE you upload to Amazon and shows you exactly what's wrong. Our diagnostic tool uses AI to detect non-compliant background pixels, text overlays, logos, format issues, and other violations—marking them visually with red indicators so you know exactly what to fix.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n🔍 **Instant compliance checking** \\- Results in \\~10 seconds  \n🎯 **Visual violation markers** \\- See exactly what's wrong with red highlights  \n⚡ **Background pixel detection** \\- Catches RGB variations invisible to human eyes  \n🚫 **Text & logo scanning** \\- Identifies overlays that violate Amazon's policies  \n📏 **Dimension & format validation** \\- Ensures your images meet technical specs  \n✅ **Automatic fixes** \\- One-click pure white background correction\n\n**Free Forever Tier:**  \n10 image checks + 3 automatic fixes per month. No credit card required.\n\nBuilt by a developer who spent months researching why Amazon sellers keep getting blindsided by image compliance issues.

This is for anyone in the community to learn from, whether you’re a developer, data scientist, or product lead.\n\nIf you’ve faced or solved interesting problems with RAG at scale, or know of meaningful articles or case studies that focus on production and scale readiness, please share!\n\nHere are a few examples I can think of:\n\n* Scaling RAG to handle 1 million+ documents — managing very large knowledge bases without latency\n* Applying RAG for real-time scenarios like live logs and anomaly detection (classification) — detecting distributed attacks and identifying if related\n* Customer support with instant document retrieval for heavy query loads — enabling fast, relevant agent responses\n* Large-scale dynamic e-commerce product search and recommendations — personalized discovery over large, frequently changing catalogs\n* Healthcare insights from vast patient records — synthesizing critical patient history for clinical decision-making\n* Financial fraud detection with streaming transactional data — spotting suspicious patterns as transactions occur\n* Legal document analysis with huge repositories — quickly extracting relevant precedents or clauses\n* Smartly vectorizing evolving documentation with minimal misses — only updating vectors for changed sections to save computation\n\nFeel free to post links only if they are about production-grade and scalable approaches, or write briefly about how you solved latency, updating knowledge bases without downtime, scaling vector search, or managing query understanding/classification in production.\n\nLooking forward to seeing this become a hub for practical, shareable knowledge so the whole community can benefit and improve RAG systems in the wild.\n\nThanks in advance for contributing!\n\n*Disclaimer: This post’s phrasing was enhanced with the assistance of AI to improve clarity and readability. So don't bash me in comments :D*\n\n*Edit 1: If possible please share how you setup data pipelines to handle data at scale*",

It's literally exploded organizations' attack surfaces in ways that are genuinely difficult to even comprehend. Every cloud service you spin up, be it an EC2 instance, S3 bucket, Lambda function, or API Gateway endpoint, all of this is a new attack vector. (...) Your cloud attack surface could be literally anything.\n\nI'm not the biggest cloud fan, but this seems a tad overly negative to me. Part of the point of the cloud is that you can depend on the security of the provider. So yes, while your attack surface technically now includes internals from aws, you won't (and can't!) be actively managing those, aws does. \n\nYes misconfiguring is still a problem, but that's hardly attributable to the cloud, that's a problem with any tool stack.\n\nOn the whole this article reads like a massive set of sometimes quite rambly examples. The main point stands: your attack surface is quite large, and larger than you think in hard to spot ways. \n\nThat's a good point of course, but I think just listing off examples like this without even mentioning threat modelling is not very useful.",

          "text": ">Email infrastructure remains a primary attack vector. Your email attack surface includes mail servers like Exchange, Office 365, and Gmail with configuration weaknesses, email authentication with misconfigured SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records, phishing-susceptible users targeted through social engineering, email attachments and links as malware delivery mechanisms, and compromised accounts through credential stuffing or password reuse.\n\n>Email authentication misconfiguration is particularly insidious. If your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are wrong or missing, attackers can spoof emails from your domain, your legitimate emails get marked as spam, and phishing emails impersonating your organization succeed. Email servers themselves are also targets. The NSA released guidance on Microsoft Exchange Server security specifically because Exchange servers are so frequently compromised.\n\nTotally agree with you flagging email infra as its own attack surface layer. What’s changed in the last 18–24 months is how that layer gets abused.\n\nWe’re seeing phishing go from “spray and pray” to AI-driven mass-spear campaigns: cheap kits plus LLMs mean an attacker can spin up polished, tailored lures in minutes, while the median time for a user to click is now under 60 seconds. Add in trusted infra (Box/DocuSign/Cloudflare, lookalike no-reply SaaS senders, etc.) and misconfigured SPF/DKIM/DMARC, and your email stack quietly turns into an identity and trust problem, not just a spam problem.\n\nThe only stuff that holds up in those cases in my experience is behavior/intent-based detection sitting inside M365/Google (social graph, language, workflow context), rather than just more reputation rules at the edge.",

Mostly escalations from devs needing help with things for which they didn't have permissions. Managers were solid: excellent engineering managers overall who treated incident response and postmortems as priorities.\n- Fintech company was new to SRE and honestly didn't get it. Management supported bad habits (e.g. hero culture) and didn't seem willing to change. Error budget was a mythical term. I dreaded on-call as I was going to be supporting broken systems and processes. Was burned out most of the time I was there, but a lot of that was unrelated to on-call (35+ hour meeting load, interpersonal problems between other SREs and dev teams, etc.).\n- Yet-another cybersecurity company also had/has lots of problems: OG devs who created the Terraform mess throws a tantrum if anyone tries to clean it up even though you have to use `-target` to make anything work. 🤮 Engineering management had no desire to make things more reliable, observable, or maintainable. On-call was also dreaded, due to the above issues. Local management (SRE/Quality Engineering) cared, but without support from above, could do little to make it better.",

      "text": "### **TL;DR**\n\nEveryone online says Gemini 3.0 and NanoBanana are amazing, but my real-world experience has been rough. Gemini ignores instructions (keeps coding when I ask for explanations), messes up rollbacks, drops features during refactors, rewrites huge sections of code for tiny changes, and often forgets imports. As a chat/Search assistant it also fails simple fact-checks and doesn’t actually search unless I force it. NanoBanana can’t follow natural-language edits and just regenerates nearly identical images.\n\nI still believe Gemini is a great model—but I feel like I’m not using it “the right way.”\nWondering if others had similar issues or know best practices to make Gemini 3.0 work as well as people claim.\n\n---\n\nI’ve been spending a lot of time with Gemini 3.0 lately, and I’m honestly confused.\n\nEverywhere I look—YouTube reviews, blog posts, benchmarks—people are showing how strong Gemini 3.0 is. A lot of AI YouTubers are running it through serious tests and proving that it’s a very capable model. Benchmarks across the internet also paint it as one of the top models right now. NanoBanana (for images) also gets a lot of love: near-photorealistic quality, natural language editing, etc.\n\nOn paper, I completely believe that Gemini 3.0 and NanoBanana are great. But when I actually use them myself, my experience just doesn’t match the reputation at all. Meanwhile, when I use GPT or Claude with basically the *same* prompting style, they behave much closer to what I expect.\n\nSo I’m trying to figure out whether I’m just using Gemini “the wrong way,” or if other people are seeing the same issues.\n\n---\n\n### Coding with Gemini 3.0\n\nOn the coding side, I’ve been using Gemini 3.0 through antigravity. There are things I genuinely like: it’s good at generating detailed plans, and I like how it can coordinate multiple agents/tools and structure the overall work. On paper, this is exactly the kind of thing I want: let the model plan, then execute step by step.\n\nBut once I actually start working with it, a lot of problems show up that I don’t see (or see much less) with GPT or Claude.\n\nFor example, I’ll ask it for a one-shot implementation and it will generate a file. That’s fine. Then something doesn’t work, so I say, “Okay, don’t write any more code, don’t call tools. Just explain what went wrong and walk me through it.” Instead of listening, it just goes straight back into coding mode and starts rewriting things again. It keeps editing the code instead of stopping and explaining, even though I clearly told it not to. GPT and Claude also have their moments, but they’re usually much better at respecting “explain, don’t code” type instructions.\n\nRollback is another sore spot. If I ask it to roll back to a previous state using Git, I expect it to do an actual Git-based rollback. Instead, it often feels like it’s just reconstructing what it *thinks* the old code looked like from the current context, then calling that a rollback. The result isn’t the real previous code; it’s basically a new version that only loosely resembles it. Claude, in my experience, handles this more safely and conservatively.\n\nRefactoring has also been problematic. The pattern is usually: we plan, we implement, and then I ask Gemini to refactor the existing code while keeping all the features intact. The plan is still in the context, the original code is right there. But the refactored version will often quietly drop some functionality. To be fair, GPT or Claude might miss things too in a big refactor, but with Gemini 3.0 I’ve had multiple cases where it dropped *too many* things, like it just forgot important parts of the original plan.\n\nThen there’s the over-editing issue. Sometimes I only need two small lines added. In theory that should be a tiny patch. Instead, Gemini decides to rewrite every block that contains those two lines and ends up touching 200+ lines in one tool call, which creates new errors that didn’t exist before. If I split the request and call the tool twice, with very small isolated changes, it behaves much better. But if I try to get everything done in one shot, it goes into “massive diff” mode and wrecks half the file. It honestly feels a bit like reward hacking: “I changed a lot of lines, I must have done more work, so this is good.”\n\nOn top of that, it has a bad habit of forgetting imports and basic glue code after a few rounds of edits. Imports disappear, small but important bits of wiring just vanish. When I point it out, it fixes one thing but misses something else. With GPT, if I say “this code is erroring, please fix it all,” it will usually clean up most of the issues in one or two passes. With Gemini, I often end up going through several cycles of errors and partial fixes, which is exhausting.\n\nAll of this is happening while GPT and Claude, using essentially the same kind of prompts and workflow, manage to understand what I want and follow through much more reliably.\n\n---\n\n### Gemini 3.0 app as a “chat + search” assistant\n\nOutside of coding, I also tried using the Gemini 3.0 app as a general assistant for everyday questions. I tend to ask for accurate, verifiable information, and since Google is literally the search company, I assumed Gemini would be very strong as a “chat + search” combo.\n\nIn reality, I’ve run into a lot of procedure hallucination. Even when I explicitly say things like “please search the web and tell me…” or “check Reddit and summarize…” it often just answers from its own internal knowledge without actually using Search. With Gemini 2.5 this was bad enough that I basically stopped using it. It would sometimes claim it had searched when it clearly hadn’t.\n\nWith Gemini 3.0 there is at least one improvement: if I call it out, it can admit “you’re right, I didn’t actually search,” and then it really does perform a search afterward. So there is some progress. But the fact that I have to babysit it and force it to actually use Search really hurts trust. ChatGPT, on the other hand, will usually just go and fetch the info when I say “please search this,” even in a pretty vague way.\n\nA small example: I like games, and sometimes when I replay an older game I forget which key does what. If I ask ChatGPT, it usually finds the right keybinding from the internet and gives me a correct answer. Gemini 3.0, in contrast, has given me wrong keys multiple times. When I correct it, it comes back with *another* wrong key. It’s such a simple fact-checking task that this kind of failure makes it really hard to trust the model on anything more important.\n\n---\n\n### NanoBanana: image quality fine, but editing experience is bad\n\nThen there’s NanoBanana. Watching YouTube demos, it looks amazing: almost photorealistic images, and really natural “edit by language” workflows. That’s one of the reasons I wanted to try it seriously.\n\nMy own experience has not matched that at all.\n\nThe way I like to work with image models is iterative: generate something, then in the next turn describe a modification (“make the sky like this,” “change this part of the road,” “adjust the lighting,” etc.), and have the model apply that change to the existing image.\n\nWith NanoBanana inside the Gemini app, that basically didn’t work. I would generate an image, then ask for a specific modification in the next turn. Instead of editing the existing image with that change, it would just regenerate almost the same image again and claim it had applied my request. If I tried once more, it would do the same thing: generate something that looks identical and insist it had changed it. This was in a production-level environment, not some experimental playground, and it still refused to behave like a proper “edit this image” workflow.\n\nThe raw image quality itself was fine, but the main selling point—natural language editing across turns—simply wasn’t there, at least in my tests. This was also supposed to be using the NanoBanana Pro model, but honestly I couldn’t tell if the Pro tier was actually active or not.\n\nMy first impression of NanoBanana when it initially launched also wasn’t great. I had it generate a sports car driving along the Italian coast, and then asked it to change the sky to a sunset and add road lights. The result looked like something a beginner might do in Photoshop: the sky was basically cut out and recolored with no real continuity, and the whole scene didn’t blend well at all. That first experience has been in the back of my mind ever since, and my recent tests haven’t really fixed that impression.\n\n---\n\n### I still think Gemini is a great model. I just don’t know *how* to use it properly.\n\nHere’s the thing: I don’t think Gemini is trash or anything like that. I genuinely believe the Gemini line is a major achievement from DeepMind/Google, and I fully accept that it’s a strong model based on benchmarks and the work people are doing with it.\n\nWhat I’m struggling with is this gap between:\n\n* the **reputation** (“Gemini 3.0 is amazing, NanoBanana is insane”) and\n* my **actual hands-on experience**, which is full of odd behavior, dropped features, over-edits, hallucinated procedures, and unreliable fact-checking.\n\nSo I’m wondering:\n\n* Do we have to use Gemini in a very different way from GPT or Claude?\n  Different prompting style, different way of structuring tasks, smaller patches, different expectations around tools?\n* Are there proven “best practices” for getting the most out of Gemini 3.0 for:\n\n  * coding and refactoring (especially with tools like antigravity),\n  * factual Q&A with Search,\n  * and NanoBanana Pro for image editing?\n* And finally, has anyone else had similar experiences?\n\n  * Models dropping features during refactor,\n  * touching way more code than necessary,\n  * saying it will search but not doing it unless you push it,\n  * getting simple stuff like game keybinds wrong repeatedly,\n  * or refusing to properly edit an existing image and just regenerating the same thing?\n\nIf you’ve found a workflow where Gemini 3.0 really shines in *real* projects (not just benchmark demos), I’d honestly love to hear how you’re using it—especially compared to GPT and Claude.\n",

First turn is “explain only, no code, no tools.” Second turn: unified diff only, touching these files/lines, no renames/refactors. Cap max output tokens \\~1500–2000 and temperature 0–0.2. For rollbacks, forbid code edits and require a real git flow: paste git log, then git reset --hard <sha> or git revert, then show the diff. After any patch, require an “import audit” + lints/tests and a checklist of invariants/features that must remain. To stop massive diffs, pin a formatter/EditorConfig and ask for -U0 diffs so it can’t reflow whole files.\n\nSearch: make it show the query first, list top 3 sources, quote snippets, then answer; if it can’t find two agreeing sources, it should say so. This fixes the keybind/fact blunders.\n\nNanoBanana: use the API with edit + mask (not chat), lock seed, and set strength \\~0.3–0.4 for subtle changes; for heavy edits, switch to ComfyUI/InvokeAI inpaint.\n\nWith Supabase for auth and Kong as the gateway, I sometimes use DreamFactory to auto-generate DB REST endpoints so the model sticks to business logic instead of churn.\n\nShort version: constrain it hard, demand minimal diffs and real searches, and it’ll act closer to the hype",

It's really, really good, but as compared to ChatGPT or other LLMs or AI chat models, it takes a lot of time to think and come up with the answer. What could be the reason behind that? Of course, the quality of the answer is good, but it's not always necessary that I am asking it for a very high-quality answer. Sometimes, it's just me asking to do an internet search of 4-5 disparate pieces of information and just collating them and putting them into one answer. Or sometimes, it could be asking the dates of some exam or something like that. Sometimes, it could be the simplest of searches, but Gemini 3 Pro takes a lot of time. With say GPT 5-Thinking, it does not take as much time to do the same task. ",

This is what I'm trying to figure out. Why do AI Studio and Vertex AI seem to be generating NATIVELY in higher resolution (they have better quality and preview is identical to downloaded image) while instead the Gemini web app uses upscaling from a lower resolution? This obviously gives slightly worse results.\nI also wonder this because the price for higher resolutions on AI Studio and Vertex AI is only justified if the model generates natively in those resolutions, because 0.24$ for a 1K image upscaled to 4K would be waaaaay too much.\n\nTo sum it up: I'm trying to figure out why the Gemini web app uses upscaling from 1K to 2K while instead AI Studio and Vertex AI support native generation.",

It's like turning ChatGPT into a British comedy writer who happens to be terrifyingly well-informed.\n\n**1. \"Explain [topic] like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it\"**\n\nThis is comedy gold that actually teaches you things. \"Explain cryptocurrency like you're John Oliver discovering something horrifying about it.\" Suddenly you understand both blockchain AND why it's probably run by people who collect vintage NFTs of their own tears.\n\n**2. \"Start with 'And look...' then build to an absurd but accurate comparison\"**\n\nPure Oliver energy. \"And look, learning to code is a bit like teaching a very literal genie to grant wishes - technically possible, but you'll spend most of your time explaining why 'make me a sandwich' shouldn't delete your entire kitchen.\"\n\n**3. \"What would John Oliver say if he had to explain this to his confused American audience?\"**\n\nGets you explanations that are both condescending and enlightening. Perfect for complex topics. \"What would John Oliver say if he had to explain the stock market to his confused American audience?\" You get economics lessons wrapped in casual British superiority.\n\n**4. \"Give me the John Oliver escalation: start reasonable, end with chaotic examples\"**\n\nHis signature move. Starts with facts, ends with \"And if that doesn't concern you, consider that [completely unhinged but true comparison].\" Try it with any serious topic. Chef's kiss.\n\n**5. \"Explain this like John Oliver just found out [authority figure] is involved\"**\n\nInstant investigative journalism vibes. \"Explain personal finance like John Oliver just found out Jeff Bezos is involved.\" You get both practical advice AND righteous indignation about wealth inequality.\n\n**6. \"What's the John Oliver 'and it gets worse' reveal about [topic]?\"**\n\nHis specialty: the moment when you think you understand how bad something is, then BOOM. Layers of additional horror. Works for everything from dating apps to climate change.\n\n**The magic trick:** Oliver's structure forces AI to be both educational AND entertaining. You learn about complex topics while laughing at how completely broken everything is.\n\n**Advanced technique:** Chain them together. \"Explain student loans like John Oliver, start with 'And look...', then give me the 'it gets worse' reveal, and end with an absurd comparison involving penguins.\"\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \"with the energy of someone who just discovered this exists and is personally offended.\" AI suddenly develops opinions and it's hilarious.\n\n**The unexpected benefit:** You actually retain information better because your brain associates facts with comedy. I now understand tax policy primarily through the lens of British outrage.\n\n**Fair warning:** Sometimes AI gets so into character it forgets to be helpful and just becomes nihilistically funny. Add \"but actually give me actionable advice\" to stay productive.\n\n**Bonus discovery:** This works for serious topics too. \"Explain therapy like John Oliver\" removes stigma by making mental health both relatable AND worth taking seriously.\n\nI've used this for everything from understanding my mortgage to learning about medieval history. It's like having a research assistant who went to Oxford and developed strong opinions about American healthcare.\n\n**Reality check:** Your friends might get concerned when you start explaining everything with escalating examples about corporate malfeasance. This is normal. Embrace it.\n\nWhat's the weirdest topic you'd want John Oliver to explain to you through AI? Personally, I'm still waiting for \"Explain my relationship problems like John Oliver just discovered dating apps exist.\"\n\nIf you are keen, you can explore our totally free, well categorized meta AI [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

If you take on this “whatever the business idea is. Cool. But now this your job. \n\nAnd you are here to make money (90% of you at least).\n\nSo how to validate if the idea you are about to undertake is actually worth it.\n\nSimple. The total amount of money you want to make in a month (can be pre or post tax) divided by the amount of hours you are willing to work in a month you want to work.\n\nFor example, if you put in the standard work hour week and do 160 hours a month and want to make $3000.\n\n= 3000 US Dollars/160 working hours\n= $18,75\n\nThen add on taxes, do it per hour. Whatever taxes you pay, let us say 20%in this case.\n\n= $18,75 + ($18,75*0,20)\n= $22,05\n\nIf you are not willing to work for $22,05 an hour OR whatever work you are doing does not pay you about that amount. \n\nYou need to ask yourself if what you are doing is worth it. \n\nForget stock options and billions. Everyone has to start from somewhere with putting in the hard grind.\n\nNow if your motivation is money and the math ain’t mathing for you. Maybe you should send that idea to the grave.\n\nThe other trick this exercise does it, it makes you understand time value into the business and that now you have to spend at least 160 hours on the idea. \n\nWorks for visual thinking people especially.

At first, I didn't notice it switched. But I noticed that since I refreshed, the performance and prompt adherence was dogshit. When I switched back to 3.0 Pro it was like night and day.\n\nIt can do C++ with somewhat intermediately complex algorithms. \n\nIt's amazing at recognizing images. Like holy crap.

Firstly I think it's an amazing model and it's on top of all the benchmarks (including swe bench on equivalent scaffolding) and so it's obviously very good. It would be impossible to benchmax these scores across so many unheard of tests, many of which are closed datasets.\n\nNow I'm also going to assume there's no malicious actors brigading Gemini subs in order to sway public opinion but given the state of the market it's not entirely out of the question.\n\nThis leads me onto two theories:\n\nThe first is loud complainers, a lot of people had high hopes for this model and although it did deliver it obviously can still make mistakes. Across all benchmarks we generally see it is smarter but across a distribution of all questions there will be some that Gemini gets wrong and GPT-5 gets right. Because everyone expects Gemini to be superior in every way they complain if it fails for their specific use case.\n\nMy second theory is from an example I saw at my job as an AI engineer. One of the teams were upgrading an AI agent from sonnet 3 to 3.5 and they noticed their test suite actually produced worse results. This was because they over fit their prompts to perform well on sonnet 3 and so they needed to retune their workflows to optimise for 3.5. It's possible we're seeing something similar here where people used to prompting in a particular way are not seeing the best results for the new model.",

It has limits and those limits mean that you don't need to pay attention to certain things, or be that explicit in your instructions. This means that on one hand, it will just naturally default to things that you can't really get around. Like I said, very rigid. But that rigidity allows you to take shortcuts because you know how it'll behave. \n\n3 is much more flexible. This allows it to do a lot more. It allows to handle much more complex problems. This makes it more useful for various tasks, like coding. But it also means that actually getting it to do what you want is more difficult, because you have to be MUCH more specific in what you ask it to do. \n\nSo if what you're used to is asking it to do something and it doing the same thing every time, 2.5 is better. But 3 will take the same instructions and interpret them in a dozen ways, which can be very frustrating. So in making it more flexible and allowing it to do more things, it's also become more difficult to wrangle.",

Which makes it less usable for long-form, large-context tasks (so coding big projects, working with a lot of different documents...). People who use LLMs for this kind of work feel disappointed and say it's a downgrade compared to the older models. Then in a month or two, these flaws get ironed out, the true intellect of the model is finally allowed to shine, and it becomes a go-to choice for serious work, too. Then the next big model Y releases, it has amazing benchmark scores, but it just doesn't work right, and people complain it's a downgrade compared to the model X...\n\nIt was like this with o3 (a lot of posts saying o1 was better), then of course with GPT-5 (a lot of people saying o3 was better!), and now we have Gemini 3 Pro, and... a lot of people say it's a downgrade compared to GPT-5.1.\n\nSo, I think the complaints are valid, but also a lot of these issues are fixable, and we should give the model some time to grow into itself. In my personal experience, Gemini 3 is wonderfully intelligent, but it also stumbles in the stupidest ways sometimes.\n\nBonus: some o3 slander from this spring :D\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y6smqap1a33g1.jpeg?width=879&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53014fbd87c2e7c211557f4c783479d0bf9ded60",

      "text": "Hi I'm new here.  Ive been hosting servers on Vast for years, and finally started playing with running models locally.  This site has been a great resource.\n\nI've seen a couple of posts in the last few days on each of the GPUs in the title.  I have machines with all of them and decided to run some benchmarks and hopefully add something back.\n\nMachines:\n\n* 8x V100 SXM2 16G.  This was the machine that I started on Vast with.  Picked it up post ETH mining craze for dirt cheap.  2x E5-2690 v4 (56 threads) 512G RAM\n* 8x 5060ti 16G.  Got the board and processors from a guy in the CPU mining community.  Cards are running via MCIO cables and risers - Gen 5x8.  2x EPYC 9654 (384 threads) 384G RAM\n* 4x 3090, 2 NVLINK Pairs.  Older processors 2x E5-2695 v3 (56 threads) 512G RAM\n\nSo the V100 and 5060ti are about the best setup you can get with those cards.  The 3090 rig could use newer hardware, they are running Gen3 PCI-E and the topology requires the pairs to cross the numa nodes to talk to each other which runs around gen3 x4 speed.\n\nSpeed specs put the 3090 in first place in raw compute\n\n* 3090 - 35.6 TFlops FP16 (936Gb/s bandwidth)\n* V100 - 31.3 TFlops FP16 (897 Gb/s bandwidth)\n* 5060ti - 23.7 TFlops FP16 (448 Gb/s bandwidth)\n\nWorth noting the 3090 and 5060ti cards should be able to do double that TFlops, but for Nvidia nerf-ing them...\n\nRan llama-bench with llama3.1 70B Instruct Q4 model with n\\_gen set to 256 (ran n\\_prompt numbers as well but they are just silly)\n\n* 3090 - 19.09 T/s\n* V100 - 16.68 T/s\n* 5060ti - 9.66 T/s\n\nNumbers wise, the generation is roughly in line with the compute capacity (edited out badly formatted table, see comment for numbers)\n\nAre there other numbers I should be running here?",

Right now next jump you will do as programmer from IDE is CLI tool, but now you have programmers not able to come up with reusable recipes unless done by themselves or unable to organize correctly a memory system that augments as AI works. \n\n\nAs linux user I now have just a split window, one with tmux + qwen cli / gemini cli, aider for commits, and emacs on the side to do git operations, and org mode for reviewing planning. Org mode is pure joy when in comes to organize text. Now I barely have to see the code and spent more time planning and designing good subtasks. \n\n\nOf course, not saying this os a workflow for everyone, I am already a full stack dev so I can define patterns and clean coding guidelines, and I am not just blindly prompting into cli tool.\n\n\nMy switch was from emacs, windsurf, to gemini cli + tmux + emacs.\n\n\nJust give it a try one or two weeks and see if it fits your workflow. I think the main reason is that cli forces you to plan better prompts and better subtasks, as you are not having context switching regarding seeing code, is like directing ai the right way.

I was delighted to move over to Antigravity (Gemini 3) when it come out, but I've found it lacking in a number of areas.\n\nFor context, I'm building a platform like Opta for soccer stats...\n\n1. It love building mock pages - Even when I expressly tell it to connect to the paid api I have with a data provider, it just builds mock pages with random data. \n\n2. It's inconsistent - It doesn't seem to follow design patterns as well as Claude. I've given it colour palletes, images of design paterns and screenshots of competitor platforms but it kind of does it's own thing and builds something quite different and when I get to a a design I like I build another page and it looks different to the first design, so I have to repeat myself again. Globalcss doesn't seem to work as well here\n\n3. It waffles - You can ask it a very simple, one line question, and it responds with way too much information. It's like talking to my ex-girlfriend.... blah, blah, blah. Just get on with it FFS. I don't need you to write war and peace, a simplier back and forth dialogue would be better.\n\n4. It's not as logical - I thought Gemini Pro 3 (High) was supposed to be more thoughtful and intelligent, but I think it's worse than easier models. It doesn't seem to understand UI/UX much as all. I went through a full project scoping, user journey and mapping excercise before building and it built things in a weird order that wouldn't follow the steps taken by real user which meant we build things in silos and I had to stop it to refactor code on a number of occassions\n\n5. It's doesn't listen very well - I could give it three instructions at once and it would go off and only fix 1-2, but forget the other things. You really need to double check everything. It apologises a lot, but I don't want an LLM to be polite and say sorry, I want it to work.\n\n6. Code errors - It seems to really struggle to fix it's own Problems. `@current_problems` in Antigravity. When I click on \"Send all to Agent\" to fix code errors, it often creates more errors than it fixes then tells me it's complete. Weird.\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed. I think Claude are trying to rip of customers as it knows it's still the superior coding platform so I really wanted Google to be better but it's just not there yet.\n\nHave you expereinced any of the issues above, or have you experienced anything else?",

Inject env vars, log outbound calls, and block merges without a passing live check.\n\n\\- Output policy: temperature 0–0.2, max tokens tight, unified diff only, “no prose.” Plan first (bullet checklist), then a single patch. Concurrency 1, no auto-apply.\n\n\\- Consistent UI: convert palette/spacing/typography into a tokens.json; wire Tailwind theme or CSS variables once. Lock a base layout and component library; edits must be prop-only, not ad-hoc CSS. Add Storybook with visual regressions.\n\n\\- UX/order: give a numbered user flow; force “working on step N only” until tests pass.\n\n\\- Listening: have it echo the 3 tasks and return DONE/NOT DONE with evidence for each.\n\n\\- Errors: fix one failing test at a time; revert if new failures > old.\n\nI run Supabase for auth and Hasura for GraphQL; DreamFactory auto-generates REST on a legacy DB so the agent hits concrete endpoints instead of inventing mocks.\n\nTight scopes, live API gates, and a pinned design system tame the chaos",

I'm mid-career and have been applying for a lot of senior or staff level roles and have been noticing a lot more of these kinds of interviews as well. It's been really frustrating! \n\nMy previous roles have all involved a lot of coding, but we always had engineers to review our code and there was never an emphasis on writing the most \"efficient\" code possible. (If that was needed we generally got an engineer involved.) I was expecting some coding interviews, but thought it would either be basic Pandas / Numpy stuff or SQL basics. Possibly even a back-and-forth coding example using simulated or sample data. I've had some of those interviews, but I've had some pretty crazy ones as well. There was one where I was completely stumped. I tried solving it later and after I finally gave up and Googled solutions, it turns out it was a round-about way of asking to build a depth-first search. (Who in data science needs to know that! And if you do, aren't the AIs smart enough to do it for you these days.)\n\nIn terms of preparing, I've found doing practice problems really helpful. Leetcode and Hackerrank have a lot of practice problems you can try. I've found [stratascratch.com](http://stratascratch.com) really good. You can filter to only see data science style questions. Most of these have Python questions. I'd recommend doing SQL ones as well as I've had a lot of SQL questions in my interviews. I've also had a good experience asking Claude to make up questions and then use it to review the solution with me. (I like Claude, but ChatGPT or Gemini should work equally well.) I wouldn't pay for anything unless you really like the platform as there seems to be a bunch of free practice questions out there. Besides brushing up on skills, I find doing the practice problems helps a lot in terms of building confidence as well -- which can be key in an interview.\n\nThe fact that these questions seem to be so popular definitely makes me wonder about where the field is going. I have a PhD and eight years of work experience and have been really surprised at how many place have grilled me on coding in the interviews, but have only asked pretty light ML and stats questions. Seems like a lot of companies want a SWE who knows some ML. (I thought that was a ML Engineer, but I guess data science roles might be becoming that.) I'm not sure it'll be good for any teams or roles that actually require research...",

I'd like to replace my roku with something with better privacy and no ads. I don't have a media library that I'm trying to host and I'm not looking to pirate, I just want something I can connect my streaming services to. It seems like it shouldn't be that difficult but I haven't found a good solution. My thought is that android can install and run apps like youtube, netflix, etc, so shouldn't there be a way to install an android distro on a raspberry pi or something and download apps onto it? Not sure if there's a project like this or if someone has looked into it. Thanks.\n\nOk to make it clearer, I'm talking about using the official Netflix and YouTube streaming apps. I'm not looking for alternatives to those. I'm only talking about the physical roku box and the os running on the roku. I would like to replace that with something open source and use it to connect to streaming services the exact same way I do on the roku",

There would be no technical problem in implementing streaming on different platforms enabling additional content hosted on different servers, it would be awesome if netflix hulu,disney+ etc were forced to do something like peertubes federation.",

I’m 16, love discovering new projects, and wanted to create a space where anyone can share what they’re building and actually be seen.\n\nAnd today… **two big things happened**:\n\n* A random builder posted their project on ***FoundrList*** completely on their own — not a friend, not someone I asked.\n* **I got my first sale.** Someone actually pulled out their card and paid for what I built.\n\nSeeing real users AND real revenue hit at the same time made every late-night coding session worth it.\n\nMy “marketing” so far has basically been:  \n• Posting progress here on Reddit 😅\n\nIf you’re building something, keep going.

As managers / hiring managers, we had to think about whether a person (and ourselves) demonstrates the capacity to learn and grow.

It can vary by degree of determination. A growth mindset isn't about having some lofty goal. But rather, a methodical, active discipline roadmap of execution.. The execution part is key. This separates the day dreamers - the talkers and the doers.  \n  \nPeople with true growth mindset actively engage in fulfilling their aspirations. I would say, some are built differently. You wake up at 5AM, not because Gary Vee tells you it is a grind. You do it because 5AM is the most convenient time that is not distracting that you can fit in 2 hours of solid non-interruption.  It is being highly disciplined.\n\nI go through those phases every so often in my life but they are always driven to come to some conclusion -- 3 or 4 month final result. It really isnt sustainable long term to breath and behave like a clock-work machine. In doses, it can be done.   \n  \nAgain, I only done this at rare times in my life -- driven by other motivating factors that allow me to focus 12 hours non-stop. And the last time that happened was a lay-off where I had to study and upskill my way out before savings burn-rate would finish.\n\nThis can also be conditioned in upbringing. 1st gen immigrants often have children who want to have a better life than their parents. I saw my father worked in the rain once and I told myself that would never be me. It is ingrain in your pysche.  \n  \nIf you are interviewing, you just explicitly ask them what it means to them in theory and practice. Do they stick to their core beliefs? Those who do can articulate the why and back up by experience. This is sort of like an ivy league admissions interview.",

If you can weather the ups and downs of the workplace and the economy and you stay curious you will probably be a big value add in your team.",

It's generally said to mean \"people open to learning/improving/...\", but even if that was true then the large majority of hiring interviewers still aren't qualified to judge - from a psychological perspective - whether someone has an actual mindset to improve or not.\n\nThe large majority of interviewers can't identify what's genuine and what's not, can't identify lies, can't identify experience/qualifications from faked confidence, can't identify or express their own biases, don't know their own biggest weaknesses or how to improve them, etc.\n\nThe #1 person that doesn't have a growth mindset, is the interviewer acting like a gatekeeper that thinks they should judge other people's psychology/identity/qualities without any qualification. Even qualified people (licensed psychologists etc.) don't do this because they know it's bullshit. This guarantees that these interviewers will block opportunities for qualified/good/strong people, and it's the definition of reduction instead of growth.\n\nIt's bullshit that sounds good so it's easy to sell, and the more it sells the more \"followers\" they get of their ~~cult~~ \"mindset\", so the more opportunities are created for the ~~cult~~ \"followers\".",

But in the last few months, there are a series of actions from the company that makes me consider seriously if my company is seriously considering it.\n\n1. Company hired a new CFO who had experience with IPO and acquisition. The old CFO was put in a different position in the company.\n\n2. Company hired a new president. The founder used to be doing the jobs a present should do. Now he hired someone professional. This guy also had experience with IPO and acquisition.\n\n3. Company hired a new chief officer in legal department. This guy had experience with acquisition and PE + M&A, sell-aid.\n\n4. Company puts on hiring advertisement for VP of financial analysis and planning strategy. Not sure what this role would mean.\n\n5. Company puts on hiring advertisement for VP for accounting. In the requirements, it clearly stated that we need to hire someone for IPO-preparation, including SOX compliance, audit preparation, financial statement preparation, public company experience preferred, big4 experience strongly preferred, etc\n\nThere are also some other companies reaching out to me paying me compensation that is higher than my current one (my current stock options are not real money).

          "text": "This sounds to me like the founder is looking to retire. He wants out of the company and for him an IPO is how he's decided to take out his profits. So it's likely an IPO will take place. But, as this path is pursued there are many reasons that could block it. Eg. the stock market crashes which means timing for an IPO is bad. Or private equity comes in and buys out the company.\n\nIn many cases after an IPO the employee shares are in a lockup for another 6 months. Often in that case when employees can sell the stock price has fallen from its IPO boost. I share this because an IPO doesn't mean insta wealth. \n\nYou are working from a vacuum of information. First thing you should do is find out from management what the current share price is valued at. The company has to report this annually to the US Gov, so it's going to be known. Re-read your options agreement and find out the share class that you have and get an understanding of the various share Classes held in the company, it's possible that your share class will get converted to public shares using a slightly different formula than other share classes, I don't think that's likely, but its good for employees to understand that their shares are not the same as the founders nor the investors. One real way this different share class can impact you is if private equity comes in and buys the company they could offer a different purchase price for employee class shares than founder class shares. Yeh, stupid shit like that can happen. I know one company that was bought by microsoft that was a win for founders and investors and a large class of employees were gifted with layoffs.\n\nThen you need to do some maths. Let's assume your option strike price is $20 a share. Current value is $25, and you can get a sense of how fast the company is growing. If revenue this year is 10% more than last then you can assume the IPO value is going to be 10% more than current, add in another few percent points because the company is going to be focused on improving its profitability to show growth to the stock market. Now with this you have some actual data that you can calculate the cost of leaving if the company IPOs. E.g. IPO at $30, your gain $10/share. Calculate that by the number of shares and that's your potential money. Keep in mind time value of money and that's all hypothetical. Which means if you want to think analytically that $10/share needs to be discounted by some percent. If you think you can get a new a job today that pays more in real cash, that's real money and worth considering.\n\nWas this helpful?",

The new accounting and FP&A roles mentioning SOX compliance, audits, and Big Four experience are literally the kind of hires companies make when they’re building the foundation to go public. To confirm if it’s real, look for changes like stricter financial reporting, Big Four auditors getting involved, internal controls tightening, or the board adding independent directors. If they start talking about KPIs like EBITDA or ARR more than usual, or refresh 409A valuations, that’s another clue. At this point, it’s safe to assume they’re actively preparing  the only question is whether they’ll actually pull the trigger before 2026 or just stay “IPO ready.”",

          "text": "I have worked in what I call fintech for over a decade. I define fintech as tech companies that facilitate and build upon the rest of the whole financial eco-system.\n\nI would also say Apple is not a fintech company. Apple pay, iTunes, the App store... these are all Apple products that have different financial elements. Those Apple products will be built upon different fintech solutions to accomplish those financial elements. Apple Pay though I would consider a \"fintech product\", iTunes and the App store are just stores that require some kind of payment processor to collect funds for the products/assets they provide. DoorDash wouldn't be fintech, but the platform facilitating it's payments would be.\n\nAmazon is deceptive cause they have a shitload of fintech products but the image of still just being the Amazon storefront. eBay wouldn't be eBay without PayPal though, and PayPal wouldn't have been PayPal without still operating on the same ACH payment rails we have today.\n\nIf Venmo (already I'd consider fintech) announces they are now letting customers get the \"Venmo Debit Card\" to access their Venmo funds, they aren't reinventing the wheel from the ground up to manufacture debit cards, they are building an integration that interfaces with the API of a fintech company the next layer down like [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/). You click a button in the venmo app, hits venmo servers, hits marqeta servers, you are entered into the card provisioning process. Venmo manages all the card features through the marqeta API. When you swipe that card it hits Marqeta's rails that interface with the underlying payment rails. Marqeta would certainly also have a myriad of different \"fintech\" integrations to connect and manage the card payment rails, card production, mailing to the customer, etc.\n\nThere are gobs of other examples for many of these layers. Robinhood is another I'd already consider fintech on the surface, but they are still going to be interfacing with other fintech companies to fetch market data ([Quodd](https://www.quodd.com/)), to place trades ([Apex](https://apexfintechsolutions.com/)), to move funds/handle subscriptions ([Stripe](https://stripe.com/)), etc, etc. I have no idea which partners Robinhood _actually_ uses under the hood for these things but for example sake. They could also very well decide to build in house but usually that is v v expensive with a lot more regulatory hoops. Early companies can't or don't want to spend the time and money so you shell out for access to an API that does it for you, they've already taken the time and risk to accomplish what you want to build on top of now.\n\nCrypto/blockchain based companies/products I would say are definitely under the fintech umbrella but kind of a different beast. I think a good suuuper simplified down way to differentiate is like traditional fintech seems more centered around the existing financial payment rails while crypto seems more centered around building new types of rails.\n\nAs far as the work goes, no fintech company is going to get far without dedicated regulatory/compliance/finance folks. That is their expertise and that is what we pay them for. If I am hiring an engineer, finance or prior fintech experience is great, but definitely not required. You want a capable engineer to build technical solutions not an accountant, but you still need the financial experience to know what problem you are building a solution for. In my experience compliance and biz folks work with product folks to define requirements, tech folks build it.\n\nThere are specific technical considerations to be had of course, like storing money values or doing money math in cents as integers instead of decimal as dollars (like in javascript 0.1 + 0.2 does not equal 0.3), or idempotency like making sure payments won't process twice if something errors and gets retried. Generally though I would not consider traditional finance/econ knowledge pertinent to my day-to-day, though for someone architecting the next PayPal that's a diff story.\n\nI also didn't go to college so there's that lol. I think I've made a decent career out of it. I've personally worked on card products, retirement/retail investment products, and loan products, developing countless different types of fintech related integrations under each.\n\nHopefully that dump of info answers most of your questions but I'm sure it also will stimulate some new ones.",

      "text": "Building project management tool as side project while working full-time. Wanted to validate actual demand before spending nights and weekends coding something nobody wants. Used SEO research and pre-launch content to confirm people search for this solution.\n\nThe validation approach was researching keyword search volume for problem-related searches. Found \"project management for creative teams\" gets 120 monthly searches, \"simple project tracking tool\" gets 95 searches, \"project management without complexity\" gets 80 searches. Not huge volume but enough to validate demand exists for simplified solution.\n\nPre-launch validation strategy included building landing page describing solution before product existed optimized for those keywords, publishing 5 blog posts targeting \"how to manage projects for small teams\" type searches, submitting to 200+ directories via [this tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org) for $127 to boost domain authority from 0, and adding waitlist signup to capture interest from organic traffic.\n\nResults over 8 weeks showed landing page started appearing on page 3-4 for target keywords, blog posts indexed and showing for longtail variations, got 67 email signups to waitlist from people actively searching for project management solutions, and 71% responded when I surveyed them about must-have features.\n\nThe validation signals were strong enough to commit to building. 67 qualified signups from organic search meant real demand exists. The 71% survey response rate gave me clear feature priorities. Domain authority at 16 means post-launch content will rank faster. Now in development with launch planned for January.\n\nCost of validation was minimal. Domain and hosting $38 for 3 months, directory service $127 one-time, landing page builder $15 monthly, email tool free tier under 100 subscribers. Total investment under $200 to validate idea and build pre-launch audience before writing any code.\n\nTime investment was 25 hours over 8 weeks including landing page creation, blog writing, directory research, and customer development conversations. Totally manageable as side project while working full-time. The validation happened in parallel with learning the tech stack I'll use for development.\n\nFor other side project builders the validation playbook is research keyword volume for your problem space, build landing page optimized for those keywords before coding product, publish blog content targeting related searches to capture organic traffic, use directory submissions to boost domain authority for faster rankings, and treat waitlist as customer development channel not just email collection.\n\nThe advantage over traditional validation methods is you're building distribution while validating. Even with modest keyword volume the organic traffic is highly qualified because they're actively searching for solutions. These leads are way better than posting in Facebook groups hoping someone cares.\n\nLaunch is now planned for January with 67 warm leads who found me organically versus launching cold with zero audience. The validation also gave me clear feature priorities from survey responses. That 8-week validation period saved me from building wrong features for 3 months.",

And even people who actually have a lot of money are still not open to buy.\n\nBefore, it used to just be cold email, a couple of meetings here and there, and boom  done. \n\nFor example, our audience is CEOs. We have a private equity hedge fund lawyer, and we got him through our World Podcast Lead gern.\n\nBasically we use Linkedin sales navigator to find high networth individuals\n\nWe chose new York and messaged him through our podcast lead generation funnel, we had him on the podcast, met him in New York, flew over and through that natural journey of him meeting me and trusting me, then we came to the proposal phase.\n\nI gave him a $2.5K setup fee and $1,000/month for client acquisition, CEOs just want revenue.\n\nAnd even with all that, and with me knowing his law firm has big money, he was still reluctant to give the $2.5K. \n\nYou’d think someone at that level wouldn’t blink at that amount but he was basically… hesitant. \n\nSo we came to an agreement we’ll waive the $2.5K, he pays $1,000/month, and because I know the system works so well, it’s on us to go out there and get the results.\n\nLowkey Chatgbt gave me advice by saying, $1,000 a month for a lawyer who has an office at Empire state building is nothing, that is why I kept that as a retainer knowing we will deliver via commision. \n\nBecause once we get a client like that and deliver, the performance checks will be much bigger, and then we’ll be referred deeper into that industry. \n\nAnd *that’s* how you actually succeed in business today by building a powerful personal brand and having equity in the game.\n\nWe tell CEOs all the time if we make more money on commission than the retainer, it means we’re doing a good job. \n\nThat’s really the business model today. All these mediocre, commoditized marketing agencies are going to be out of business, because yes, baby boomers have money but now more than ever, they’re VERY careful where they put it. \n\nLong gone are the days where you can just “look good” without doing real work. You have to be making people revenue.\n\nIf you can get to the point where someone is paying you $10K/month and you’re making a big chunk of that through commission it means you’re delivering. \n\nThat’s what CEOs want now more than ever, *A players.* And that’s what we do for these CEOs.\n\nSo even though it may feel hard right now, if you’re an expert and you’re genuinely good at what you do, you’ll succeed.\n\nLet me know what you guys think.",

Everyone’s been burned by agencies, freelancers, and tools that overpromised, so even folks with deep pockets are way slower to commit. The bar has moved from sounds good to prove it first.\n\nWhat you described with the lawyer is pretty much the new normal: relationship first, proof second, money third. Buyers want to see you in action before they hand anything over, which is why content, credibility, and hands-on value matter a lot more than clever outreach. Even on my side, I’ve seen deals close faster when I focus on timing and intent, reaching out when there’s a clear need, not just because they fit the ICP. Good data helps with that; tools like The Grid make it easier to know who’s actually active or growing so we’re not chasing people who aren’t in market.\n\nI don’t think B2B sales is “dead” it’s just shifted from selling a service to selling confidence. If you can actually deliver and you’re willing to put skin in the game, like you said, you can still win big.

Don’t waive setup; convert it into prepaid credits or a performance holdback (e.g., 30% variable released on 2–3 agreed metrics). Use a mutual action plan in Accord or Dock, single‑thread to the CFO early, and ask “who owns the budget and by when?” If they balk, trade, don’t cave: shorter pilot, smaller scope, or case study rights-never free work. Publish proof weekly: pipeline math, payback model, call clips, and hard numbers.\n\nFor tools, HubSpot for deal hygiene, Gong for qualification, Clay + Apollo for sniper lists; I’ve used HubSpot and Gong to tighten this and leaned on Demand Revenue for formalizing CMO‑level guardrails and ROI narratives.\n\nBottom line: de‑risk for buyers while protecting your margin; proof and discipline close deals now",

Such post just steals people's time and disappoints.\n\nAnother type of post getting the hate creates an impression that OP is about to share some valuable knowledge but all it does in the end is attempt to convert to their paid newsletter, coaching session or some other bs. And you as a reader don't even know if any of this info is true or just made up stuff. Such approach always feels like an insult to the reader's intelligence, that OP does not perceive them smart enough to see through their cover up story.\n\nTLDR people dislike when someone misleads them and steals their time by producing content that can be perceived as low-effort.

My biggest complaint is that for an Asian person, Boston is so much more unfriendly and inconvenient. I’ve experienced more racism than I ever did. And there’s barely any Asian grocery stores/high quality Asian restaurants. The cost of living in Boston is mind bogglingly high, maybe even on par with the Bay Area. I’m paying 2.5k for a one bedroom in an area that’s considered ghetto by Bostonians. And on top of this, the weather just isn’t comparable to California and there’s nothing to do in the winter.\n\nMy original plan was to work here for 2-3 years, do a part time masters (recently got into UPenn), and then t try to job hop back to California. There are also some people who told me to just keep applying now, but I feel like 2 months at a company isn’t a good look, and I’m basically still a new grad and I still need to compete with them. I would also feel bad for my team if I just ditch them after several months. What’s my best course of action?",

And kudos to you for having plans for further education and improvement. \n\nI don’t have a ton of concrete advice for you but I have a few anecdotes from my 10-15 years experience in the field (I’m currently a principal/staff data scientist, formerly FAANG or whatever the acronym is now):\n\n- Getting an industry-focused masters while working part time in my mid-20s was I think pound for pound the best thing I did for my future career prospects. Short term pain for long term gain. Just make sure you can swing taking on the debt. \n- Adopting a mindset of learning everything I can, running towards responsibilities instead of away, helping/teaching others, and making myself useful/indispensable have been helpful north stars for career advancement and personal satisfaction. \n  - A note about responsibilities: between being overwhelmed with too much, and being bored & listless, there exists a space of mild discomfort — this is where personal growth happens!\n- Having good colleagues, good WLB, and a trajectory for growth at a given workplace is worth its weight in gold. Don’t be too quick to jump ship if you have that. \n- Be careful about bouncing around too much chasing higher pay or other things driven by a “grass is greener” mindset. It might ultimately pay off but it can also make you look unreliable to a potential employer. It’s a hard balance to strike. \n\n\nI sympathize with your desire to leave Boston and come back to California. The weather there can be pretty wack, and the culture is quite different.\n\nI think often about what Joe Walsh (guitarist for the Eagles) said: when you’re going through it, life seems like a constant barrage of random chaos, but later in hindsight it ends up looking like a finely-crafted novel. \n\nIt’s important to have goals and a plan, while still holding things loosely and try to enjoy the ride. \n\nBest of luck to you! You’ll do great things. \n\nCheers",

      "text": "Solo indie hacker building workflow automation tool. Started with $1800 savings and zero budget for paid ads. Had to figure out customer acquisition through purely organic channels. Four months later at $6K monthly recurring revenue with 88% from organic search.\n\nThe constraint of no ad budget forced me to focus entirely on organic from day one. Strategy was building SEO foundation that compounds over time rather than paid ads that stop when money runs out. Everyone said SEO takes forever but I needed sustainable acquisition without burning my limited capital.\n\nMonth one was pure foundation work with zero revenue. Submitted site to 200+ directories through [this tool](http://getmorebacklinks.org) for $127 to establish baseline domain authority since I didn't have weekends for manual form-filling. Got listed on Product Hunt, Indie Hackers showcase, BetaList, every startup directory I could find. Set up Search Console, fixed technical issues, researched 30 keywords my ICP searches.\n\nMonth two focused on content with DA climbing to 14. Published three blog posts weekly targeting longtail problem keywords. Created comparison pages like \"My Tool vs Zapier\" even though my product had obvious gaps. Started appearing on pages 3-4 in search results which felt like progress from total invisibility.\n\nMonths three and four showed real traction. Domain authority hit 22 as backlinks indexed. Got first organic customer signups through website. Conversion rate was 34% because organic visitors were actively searching for solutions not random traffic. Revenue reached $6K MRR by month four with 22 paying customers.\n\nSpecific tactics that worked were directory submissions for instant DA boost (0 to 14 in first 30 days), publishing 3x weekly targeting problems not products, creating comparison content that converts searchers with buying intent, optimizing conversion rate hard since traffic volume was limited, and asking happy customers for testimonials to build social proof.\n\nWhat didn't work was trying to rank for competitive keywords early. Complete waste with low DA. Also tried Twitter growth which brought followers but zero paying customers. Focused organic search worked better because people searching have intent and budget.\n\nCost over 4 months was minimal. Directory service $127 one-time, hosting $12 monthly, email tool $18 monthly, SEO tools $35 monthly. Total under $400 to reach $6K MRR. Compare that to paid acquisition where you'd burn $6000-8000 for similar revenue.\n\nTime investment was real at 55 hours monthly first 3 months on content and SEO work. Months 4 dropped to 35 hours as processes got efficient. This is sweat equity but way more sustainable than burning cash on ads that might not work.\n\nFor other indie hackers the path is unglamorous but effective. Build SEO foundation week one through directories and content. Publish consistently targeting buyer-intent keywords. Optimize conversion ruthlessly. Be patient through first 90 days when results seem minimal. Compound effect takes time but it works.\n\nThe advantage over venture-backed competitors burning money on ads is unit economics. My CAC is essentially zero while theirs is $250-400. I'm profitable at $6K MRR while they need $40K MRR to break even on ad spend. Boring organic growth beats flashy paid for bootstrapped indie hackers.",

      "text": "\n\n\n\nIn an interview recently. Sam Altman commented that while he didn't think there was an AI bubble, some players were poised to lose a whole lot of money. Before Moonshot AI launched Kimi K2 Thinking on November 6 and before Google launched Gemini 3 on November 18, coming out of nowhere to massively leapfrog over every other AI by an historic margin, we might have wondered who these big losers in the AI race would ultimately be. Now that the numbers are in, it seems Altman might have presciently been talking about OpenAI.\n\nHere's why. Let's begin with OpenAI's revenue projections for the next 5 years, all calculated before the launch of Kimi K2 Thinking and Gemini 3. A few key points stand out. First, OpenAI made those earnings projections about products that don't yet exist. Second, no one has yet created the demand for these products. And third, perhaps most importantly, OpenAI apparently didn't factor in the competition.\n\nSo when a 2-year-old startup from China open sources a thinking model it trained on less than $5 million, (by comparison GPT-5 cost OpenAI between $1.5 billion and $2 billion to train) you have to appreciate how much the AI landscape has shifted in a matter of days. And K2 Thinking was not just another model. It outperformed GPT-5. Grok 4, Gemini 2.5, and Claude 4 on many of the most important benchmarks. Of course the threat that OpenAI faces isn't really about Moonshot or Kimi K2 Thinking. It's about the world now knowing with absolute certainty that a small lab spending a miniscule amount of money can overtake ALL of the AI giants, while costing consumers and enterprises from 2 to 10 times less to run.\n\nBut Kimi K2 Thinking really isn't what OpenAI should be worried about. Let the following sink in:\n\nGemini 3 set monstrous new highs with 37.5% on Humanity’s Last Exam and 45.1% on ARC-AGI-2 in Deep Think mode—nearly doubling GPT-5 on both measures. It also scored 1501 Elo on LMArena and 91.9% on GPQA Diamond, outperforming GPT-5 and Claude across strategic reasoning, scientific knowledge, and abstract problem-solving. And that's just the beginning. Gemini 3 dominated its competitors far beyond those key benchmarks. If you're brave enough to review a brutally detailed account of how  completely Gemini 3 trounced OpenAI and pretty much everyone else on pretty much everything, check out the following stats:\n\nhttps://www.vellum.ai/blog/google-gemini-3-benchmarks?utm=&utm_source=direct&utm_medium=none\n\nThese scores position Gemini 3 way ahead -- perhaps years ahead  -- of OpenAI on the metrics that matter most to both consumer and enterprise AI. Essentially Google just ate OpenAI's lunch, dinner and breakfast the next day.\n\nBut that's just the competition part of all of this. While Kimi K2 Thinking clearly demonstrates that massive data centers are just not necessary to building the most powerful AIs, OpenAI has committed $1.4 trillion in investments to build massive data centers, most of which won't be operational for years. It could be that this miscalculation  -- this massive misappropriation of investment commitments -- best comes to explain why OpenAI may have positioned itself to be THE big loser in the AI bubble that Altman warned everyone about. \n\nThe bottom line is that if OpenAI doesn't pull a rabbit out of the hat during 2026, it may become the first major casualty of the AI bubble that will hopefully be limited to colossally unwise investments like those of OpenAI. For their sake, let's hope that it's a really, really big rabbit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Web Platform and AI Studio somehow gave me near consistent performance in a wide range of topics and usage, such as architecture planning to roleplay and creative writing. Meanwhile my main use case on Antigravity was working on my Go API Server and C++ application.\n\nAnd dare I say, the performance on Gemini 3.0 Pro on Antigravity almost made me rethink if I was wrong on my previous verdict of the model's performance so far, because it frequently get stuck in loops, failed edits on the file, and sometimes it stopped in the middle of a coding session without any reason. I almost gave up using Gemini 3.0 Pro for development that is until I checked my Gemini CLI and I finally got access to the model in the CLI.\n\nAnd from the screenshot above, you can see that I have been using it for the whole day, and my faith in the model has been restored, pardon me if I am not very good in sharing how I used it, but mainly the same usage as in Antigravity and this time, it actually made the right edits, no loopings, overall a smooth experience. Though the quota is a bit strict, it seems I only got 260 daily request and have to wait for 13 hours I can start using it again. But I am very satisfied. Again, pardon my formatting. Anyone else had similar experience in Gemini CLI? Were you as satisfied as I am?\n\nEdit: Somehow the image wasn't included when I posted.",

Don't upload a bunch of pictures, as that gets converted to tokens and takes up a big chunk.  Same for PDF files.  Also if you're using the new Code execution and file creation capability, any time Claude uses bash commands or does a lot of file tweaking/creation, that eats up a ton of tokens.\n\nFor example, when just talking to Haiku there's almost no way I can hit the 5 hour limit in 5 hours... my \"usage\" stays below 15%.  BUT If I ask Haiku to edit a skill file or he uses the Code execution and file creation capability to create a file to save locally (to him) I will see the usage spike quickly.",

It shows the plan and when you build it, you can review the changes in one place.\n\nAlso, I think this weekend, there's a new update where they added question selection. Really awesome. I don't know why but I like the plan mode of Cursor than Claude Code.

Is it really unlimited? Been using this whole day and I'm not sure if I'm hitting the limit or what. I'm only on 20$ plan.",

      "text": "The first guy spent 3 months with ChatGPT building his SaaS. Got auth working, CRUD operations, decent UI. Completely stuck on Stripe integration. Not because Stripe is complicated - the AI had created this nightmare architecture where nothing connected properly. Took me a week to untangle and get it working (Stripe was only the beginning).\n\nThe second one was a React app. The components were beautiful, and everything looked great in isolation. But zero state management, doubled API calls everywhere, and no error handling. The moment they needed features to talk to each other? Dead in the water.\n\nThe third time, I'm like... wait, this is a pattern.\n\nHere's what ChatGPT/Claude/whatever can't do:\n\n* Make architectural decisions. It doesn't know your scale or constraints, so it builds for the fast demo. It picks solutions that are popular, even if they are enterprise-first.\n* Can't properly test your app or understand the bigger picture of possible meltdowns.\n* Plan for edge cases. What if the API is down or slow? User does something weird? LLM doesn't think about that unless you specifically prompt for it. And when it does, it overcomplicates things.\n\nThe gap from 80% done to actually shippable? That's not more code. It's architecture, experience, and hands-on coding.\n\nAfter the third project, I told my dev partner, \"screw it, we're doing this full-time.\"\n\nThat's VibeFixed - we take your AI-generated app and get it launch-ready. I'm a fractional CTO with 11 years of shipping apps, and he's a Senior Dev. We've both seen every stupid mistake a hundred times, so we know what breaks before it breaks.\n\nRunning a good offer right now because I want a few more testimonials, but honestly, if you're stuck between \"mostly works\" and \"damn I can actually launch this\" - that's exactly what we're building this for.",

      "text": "I used to stare at problems and overthink them for hours.\n\nThen I started using prompts that break problems into small parts.\n\nThey turn confusion into clarity fast.\n\nThese six are the ones I trust the most 👇\n\n# 1. The Problem Clarifier\n\nThis stops you from solving the wrong thing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five simple questions to understand my problem clearly.  \n    Then write one sentence that explains the real problem I am trying to solve.  \n    Keep the sentence short and direct.  \n    Situation: [describe your problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you see the root issue without guessing.\n\n# 2. The Root Cause Scanner\n\nMost problems have layers. This reveals them.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Break down this problem into three parts  \n    1. What I think the problem is  \n    2. What might be causing it  \n    3. What is only a symptom and not the real issue  \n    Then explain which part I should focus on first and why.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Makes the problem feel smaller and easier to approach.\n\n# 3. The Solution Map\n\nInstead of one idea, you get a full field of options.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me three different ways to solve this problem.  \n    For each option explain  \n    1. How it works  \n    2. What makes it simple  \n    3. What makes it risky  \n    Then tell me which one is the most practical starting point for me.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n    Constraints: [insert limits or resources]  \n\n💡 Gives you choice without overwhelming you.\n\n# 4. The Step By Step Fix\n\nTurns a big messy situation into a clear path.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Take this problem and break the solution into clear steps I can follow.  \n    Explain what I should do first, second, and third.  \n    Make the steps realistic and small enough to do today.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you move instead of freezing.\n\n# 5. The Risk Check\n\nShows you what you might be missing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this situation and list the possible risks or things that could go wrong.  \n    Then give me one simple way to prevent or reduce each risk.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Gives you confidence before you take action.\n\n# 6. The Decision Helper\n\nPerfect when you feel stuck between choices.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I am choosing between these options: [list choices].  \n    Compare them by effort, reward, and long term impact.  \n    Then tell me which option gives me the best balance based on what I want.  \n    My goal: [insert goal]  \n\n💡 Helps you choose with calm instead of stress.\n\nGood problem solving is not about being smart. It is about asking the right questions in the right order. These prompts do that for you.\n\nIf you want to save these prompts or build your own set, you can keep them inside [Prompt Hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\nIt helps you store and reuse the prompts that actually work.",

You might discover that even small automations can have a significant positive impact on your productivity.

The Problem Clarifier\n\nThis stops you from solving the wrong thing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five simple questions to understand my problem clearly.  \n    Then write one sentence that explains the real problem I am trying to solve.  \n    Keep the sentence short and direct.  \n    Situation: [describe your problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you see the root issue without guessing.\n\n# 2. The Root Cause Scanner\n\nMost problems have layers. This reveals them.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Break down this problem into three parts  \n    1. What I think the problem is  \n    2. What might be causing it  \n    3. What is only a symptom and not the real issue  \n    Then explain which part I should focus on first and why.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Makes the problem feel smaller and easier to approach.\n\n# 3. The Solution Map\n\nInstead of one idea, you get a full field of options.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me three different ways to solve this problem.  \n    For each option explain  \n    1. How it works  \n    2. What makes it simple  \n    3. What makes it risky  \n    Then tell me which one is the most practical starting point for me.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n    Constraints: [insert limits or resources]  \n\n💡 Gives you choice without overwhelming you.\n\n# 4. The Step By Step Fix\n\nTurns a big messy situation into a clear path.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Take this problem and break the solution into clear steps I can follow.  \n    Explain what I should do first, second, and third.  \n    Make the steps realistic and small enough to do today.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you move instead of freezing.\n\n# 5. The Risk Check\n\nShows you what you might be missing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this situation and list the possible risks or things that could go wrong.  \n    Then give me one simple way to prevent or reduce each risk.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Gives you confidence before you take action.\n\n# 6. The Decision Helper\n\nPerfect when you feel stuck between choices.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I am choosing between these options: [list choices].  \n    Compare them by effort, reward, and long term impact.  \n    Then tell me which option gives me the best balance based on what I want.  \n    My goal: [insert goal]  \n\n💡 Helps you choose with calm instead of stress.\n\nGood problem solving is not about being smart. It is about asking the right questions in the right order. These prompts do that for you.\n\nIf you want to save these prompts or build your own set, you can keep them inside [Prompt Hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\nIt helps you store and reuse the prompts that actually work.",

Despite the improvements in AI, the quality of roleplaying AI is still fundamentally suffering the following three major problems:\n\n* Memory: as soon as the chat session gets long, the AI starts forgeting and hallucinating = instant dealbreaker\n* Character consistency: vast majority of models are not able to keep perfect character consistency (especially with multiple characters) due to instruction following issues\n* Rejection and boundaries: roleplaying often require touching on mature themes, but the best models for RP are usually the ones most strict with regards to content and guardrails\n\nSo I spent the last 3 months building \"Roleplay Game Master\" aimed at solving these three fundamental issues:\n\n* Memory: use retrieval-augmented generation to power unlimited memory and chat history\n* Character consistency: use the best instruction following and roleplaying model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) to power the underlying itnelligence\n* Rejection and boundaries: custom prompting to maximize creative freedom and to minimize rejections\n\nYou can try it here: [https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master](https://www.jenova.ai/a/roleplay-game-master)\n\nHere are some user review:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r8xonnvfyz2g1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99f01a395b9f15053c66253138674065179f9250\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p976p2igyz2g1.jpg?width=1178&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29aeb8feb4ecaf049c21e4a89822f013acf86172",

Trying to change it destroys the DB migrations, so I feel that I may be better off rewriting in node/express.\n\nRegardless, I'll do my best to minimize unnecessary work.",

I use a multiagent, rag, altered ruleset, near death, obscure death, and full death system(harder to do with some models but you would be surprised how you can work around it)\n\nI use a rolling save agent which updates a main story, a secondary agent that updates and tracks all players actions(in this case just me playing 3 characters) and a specialized tagging system. The big win for me was an agent that injects randomness into the main model for events which does a soft check and then injects a prompt into the main for some events to feel alive. \n\nIn fact I would say that my big breakthrough was not having 1 dm model do everything but almost as if its a 2 dm or 3dm model. Wasn't as hard to setup as I thought. Was very much more about learning python, understanding what tricks I needed to pull.\n\nIts the #1 reason I use LLM's in the first place.",

Not a safety refusal (external to the reply) but just steering you into a situation where bad things don't happen because it wants to please the user. \n\nHowever:\n\n1. Human DMs frequently rescue TPKs depending on the kind of game the group is trying to play. If you are playing a crunchy combat focused game then if they system says you die re-roll but if you are playing a 90% dialogue based game focused on problem solving and politics and threw in a combat for a bit of fun then realize your players aren't really speced for it, then you need to recover your (as a DM) fuckup or people won't come back next week. I think the user needs to decide if they behavior in this particular game / moment.\n2. If you tell the system to kill you in the system prompt, you'll get behavior you don't want (it will try too hard, bend rules, create unwinnable situations).",

The reality is AI can be fun as a DM but it acts very different from what makes real DMs interesting and fun. I dabble a bit in programming and made some tricks (like a concrete memory storage) so it could track initiative and combat rounds + hp but ultimately I got so into how it was possible to augment AI with different tools that I lost interest in playing the game. I would encourage people to play with an AI DM but also say it doesn't replace the experience and we might still be pretty far from that reality.",

So it's more an exercise in collaborative storytelling than solely the player being in the DM's story. Then you can expand the memory further by saving key info or scene excerpts into a txt file and uploading that to go beyond the conversation history and act as a memory expansion, although last time I did this in ChatGPT it disabled mini, i.e. implemented a token limit.

Forget it\n\nI'd find an amazing article, try to convert it to PDF, upload it to NotebookLM... and it would either fail to parse or return gibberish.\n\nThe root cause: many websites use JavaScript rendering, encryption, or other techniques that standard PDF conversion tools can't handle.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zg4qwvbvh03g1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=52523ac5d800d9f2628c6398b826442a98b9a726\n\n# The \"Aha\" Moment\n\nOne day I thought: *\"What if I could just capture what I'm reading RIGHT NOW – exactly as it appears in my browser – and convert that directly to PDF?\"*\n\nThat's when I decided to build a Chrome extension that does one thing well: **one-click webpage-to-PDF conversion** that respects the actual layout and formatting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3rqyvdrwh03g1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f406f3d34e6b0381f17541f4c07fe8657fda6aa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iex25t1yh03g1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ab89c09f8867d871f57852bcc41eb53e96a3267\n\n# What I Built\n\n**WEBxPDF** is a lightweight Chrome extension that:\n\n* ✅ Converts any webpage to PDF in seconds\n* ✅ Preserves the original layout and formatting (no ugly text soup)\n* ✅ Supports right-click menu + keyboard shortcuts\n* ✅ Works offline after initial install\n* ✅ Free tier with pro features available\n\nThe workflow is now:\n\n1. Find an article/webpage I want to study\n2. Click extension → 1-click PDF\n3. Import to NotebookLM → build my custom knowledge base\n\nIt's been a game-changer for me.\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1p4nccy/video/wgnki050i03g1/player\n\n# For NotebookLM Users Specifically\n\nIf you're doing research, building a knowledge base, or studying topics across multiple websites:\n\n* Stop struggling with copy-paste or broken PDF imports\n* Stop fighting with paywalls and encrypted content rendering\n* Just convert what you see → PDF → NotebookLM ✅\n\n# Why I'm Sharing This\n\nI built this to scratch my own itch, but I realized other people might have the same problem. Reddit's been super helpful to me over the years, so here you go.\n\nYou can find it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) – search \"WEBxPDF\" or visit our site.\n\n[https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bpaiojciiofcllmlgalgfiafmgdekhee?utm\\_source=item-share-cb](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bpaiojciiofcllmlgalgfiafmgdekhee?utm_source=item-share-cb)\n\n**Questions?** Happy to chat about:\n\n* Why I chose to build vs. use existing tools\n* The technical challenges with PDF conversion\n* How it compares to alternatives like PrintFriendly or built-in print-to-PDF\n\nAppreciate any feedback! 🙌",

A simple, low-pressure DM like “hey, saw you were dealing with X, I built something small that might help, want to try it?” gets way more traction than any public post.\n\nCommunities can work too, but only if you join the ones where your users actually hang out and spend a little time engaging before you share anything. And honestly, having a clean, targeted list makes a big difference. I’ve used The Grid [sgpgrid.com](http://sgpgrid.com) for that when I needed to find small batches of the “right” people instead of spraying random creators.\n\nMost early users come from 1:1 conversations, not virality.

Every early SaaS founder has to fight through it, and the pattern is more consistent than people think.\n\nYour first real users almost never come from posting alone. They come from conversations. Not sales conversations. Curiosity conversations.\n\nHere’s what has worked for me and for a lot of early teams:\n\n1. **Find the first ten through pain matching, not promotion.** Look for people talking about the exact problem your product solves. Not the niche. Not the industry. The problem. Whenever someone says, “This is driving me crazy,” join the thread with something genuinely useful. No pitch, just clarity. Five to ten percent will naturally turn into DMs.\n2. **Send DMs with one honest line.** Not “Can I get your feedback?” Not “Try my tool.” Just something simple like, “I saw you’re dealing with X. How are you handling it right now?” People answer that. The moment they describe their process, you’re in the real conversation.\n3. **Sit inside communities where people are already trying to solve the problem manually.** Slack groups, subreddits, Discords. Not to promote, but to observe. Users reveal their workflow through their complaints.\n4. **Make one short video showing the transformation, not the product.** When someone feels, “That fixes my exact moment of pain,” the barrier disappears. They want the link.\n5. **Early testers come from people who feel seen, not sold.** Creators want relief. Builders want momentum. Operators want clarity. Match the emotion and you earn attention.\n\nIf you’re getting email only signups, that’s a signal. People are curious, but not invested yet. It means you’re close.\n\nThe leap happens when someone thinks, “Wait, this fixes the thing slowing me down.” Once that lands, everything shifts.\n\nHappy to dive deeper if it helps. This stage feels lonely, but it’s more winnable than it looks once the right conversations start compounding.",

      "text": "I’ve been dealing with .ICS files a lot for a project at work, and it has been a real struggle. I realised that they’re 25+ years old, every calendar provider handles them differently, their APIs are all a pain in the ass, and the whole thing feels like duct tape on top of duct tape.\n\nI shot for the stars a little and created a JSON envelope for JSCalendar (the proposed replacement for ICS by CalConnect) that better serves live updates, versioning, signing and webhooks. I called it ACE (Active Calendar Events) and wrote about it here: [https://aceproject.dev/](https://aceproject.dev/)\n\nI then built a small events system that uses ACE and aims to give developers a way of sending event invites via the API/SDKs and keep them synced. It's at the point that I always get to with projects where I struggle to see the wood for the trees and actually validate the idea outside of my own mind.\n\nSo I’d love some brutally honest feedback from other devs who’ve fought with invites, RSVPs, timezones, sync issues OR just have an opinion on the ideas as a whole.  \nDoes it make sense? Is this solving a real pain, or am I just over-indexing on my own frustrations?\n\nSynara's homepage here: [https://synara.events]()\n\nI'm not looking for traffic or signups, just a sanity check from other devs!",

WEB is internet facing so it can be compromised. Assuming WEB gets compromised, a process can be started on WEB to see all data flowing back and forth. If the connection to DB is encrypted, this fails, and the attacker needs to come up with a plan to further compromise other machines on your network. If the connection is not encrypted, the attacker can start processing that data to see what they can find. Same thing if a pc is plugged into your network that is compromised (i.e. guest wifi, some plugs in a raspberry pi, etc). So this is about risk management and damage control. Network security isn't about making yourself unhackabale but making it such a pain to compromise you that your neighbor is an easier target (thing house has a beware of dog sign vs other house that has cameras, a fence, and bars on the windows).",

      "text": "I just bought my first house and would like to get a home security system setup, but know nothing about the space. My main priority is keeping it fully self-managed for privacy and avoiding a subscription. \n\nThe house came with a Qolsys IQ panel (looks like the IQ2) and there's a box in the garage that appears to go with it but I haven't gotten a chance to check that out yet. Google tells me that this panel will only ever work through alarm.\\\\com so I'm expecting to remove it, along with the ADC-branded cameras. The door sensors are Qolsys as well, but it sounds like the 319.5 frequency that they operate on may be a standard and allow them to be used with another system?\n\nFor cameras I want to use my POE switch. Need to pick out cameras, run the ethernet, and setup an NVR. Ideally I would like to get correlated events and video clips.\n\n\n\nI'm just looking for tips, recommendations, and potential pitfalls. Seems like there is a spectrum from adopting existing panels (e.g. Honeywell) to full-diy with z-wave sensors and an android tablet (if I even really need a panel), and I'm open to any of it right now depending on the cost / reliability / ease-of-use ratio.",

Walk door to door in your neighborhood and sell monthly contracts. First cut is free. Once you have some money, upgrade your mower and if you live somewhere the snow flies, buy a snowblower & sweeper for the other season. \n\n2. Same plan as above, but a cleaning company. You can buy everything you need to start residential cleaning for under 100 bucks (might need to find a used mop). First clean is free, then sell a monthly contract before you leave. I started a very successful cleaning business 15 years ago doing this but got out of it in 2019. \n\nThere are a number of other similar type businesses that can run on that same simple model. \n\n3. Based on your skill set, start a newsletter & sell ad space, products, premium subscriptions etc. Beehive is free up to 2500 dollars. Assuming you're willing to pay yourself nothing for your time & dedicate yourself to the most guerilla marketing tactics available, you can get started for well under 100 bucks. That is slow growth though and takes a ton of commitment. I've had great results with mine though.",

Avoid calling your backend from middleware; if the access token is missing/expired, redirect to a server route like /api/refresh that rotates tokens and sets cookies with Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax (None for cross‑site) and correct Domain/Path. If you’re stuck on HS256, don’t verify at the edge-either gate by presence and let the API enforce, or verify in the Node server runtime where the secret can live. Plan for key rotation, refresh token rotation, and log denials with reasons.\n\nI’ve used Keycloak and Auth0 for OIDC/JWKS; DreamFactory helped when I needed a quick gateway validating JWTs and enforcing RBAC while proxying to Spring.\n\nBottom line: asymmetric tokens + JWKS verify at the edge, refresh via server routes with HttpOnly cookies",

Cache the JWKS, validate iss/aud/exp, and only gate on minimal claims (e.g., role=admin) for protected routes. Keep access tokens short (5–15 min) in HttpOnly cookies and run refresh through a Next.js API route; on 401, an interceptor hits /api/refresh and retries. In Spring, run Resource Server, map claims to authorities, and enforce with method-level checks; that’s your real RBAC. For service-to-service, use client credentials and mTLS if you can, not user tokens.\n\nI’ve used Keycloak and NextAuth for issuing/sessions, and DreamFactory when I needed an API layer that validated JWTs and applied RBAC while proxying legacy endpoints.\n\nNet: verify and gate lightly at the edge, but do definitive authz in Spring on every request",

That simplifies things already.\n\n\nUser ( browser) initiates login flow with the backend that issues tokens. Backend issues access token in httponly cookie and refresh token in httponly cookie that has custom path to limit it only to token refresh endpoint. Never send refresh tokens along normal requests.\n\n\nClient can keep track of the login status and last refresh timestamp in e.g. localstorage or additional cookie that accessible in js. This way you don't need to make a roundtrip when e.g. reload happens and can start to render correct UI immediately. \n\n\nAll requests the app makes should go through a centralized API/network service that has token management built-in. If the server returns an error ( 403 usually) indicating token is expired/invalid, client will block/queue further requests and initiate refresh cycle. Note that any ongoing parallel requests shouldn't initiate it to avoid race conditions , that's why this needs to be managed. And that's also why you don't refresh on behalf of client in BFF. \n\n\nTalking specifically about NextJS, I think regular sessions work better usually with the model it's built around and the unmanaged network requests. But using tokens to for example get the user id on nextjs server is perfectly fine, you can do middleware auth checks etc. It's just validating the signature and accept ot reject. ",

Middleware should be light: check cookie, decode header to read exp, and if missing/expiring soon, redirect to /api/refresh. Put refresh token in an HttpOnly, Secure cookie with Path=/api/refresh and rotate it server-side. For cross-site, use SameSite=None; add a CSRF token header. Centralize client requests with a single-flight refresh promise; on 401, try one refresh then replay the request, otherwise wipe state and send to login. For multi-subdomain, set cookie [Domain=.yourdomain.com](http://Domain=.yourdomain.com); if that’s not possible, use a BFF route handler that adds Authorization on server fetches.\n\nI’ve used Keycloak for OIDC and Kong for JWT/rate limits; DreamFactory helped when I needed an API gateway validating JWTs and enforcing RBAC in front of Spring Boot.\n\nSo yeah: public-key verify in middleware, refresh via server route, keep middleware light",

The routine, entry-level, repetitive work?\n\nAI will take over a huge portion of it.

          "text": "Firstly, AI agents absolutely *are* glorified automation! However, whereas traditional automation is often capped by its ability (or its programmer's ability) to handle complexity and ambiguity, LLMs are able to reason and deduce within highly complex contexts.    \n  \nAs with any automation project, you should start with the problem and build up complexity and capability incrementally. Agents-for-the-sake-of-agents is likely to be a frustrating experience if you can't find a sufficiently interesting use case. \n\nStart with some kind of knowledge-base task that you do frequently and requires enough brainpower that it would be interesting to automate.   \n  \nMy first agent was a meal planning agent. It takes some basic inputs (\"I want something healthy on Monday, something in the slow cooker on Thursday, etc.\") and creates a meal plan for the week, recipes for each meal, and a shopping list categorized into grocery aisles. This is something that I had to do every week and would not only take up a couple of hours of my precious weekend, but I also found drained a surprising amount of brainpower trying to come up with interesting meals each week.   \n  \nI originally created a meal planning project in the Claude web client as a large instruction set with some sample meal plans loaded into the project, and it did okay. But I found that the instruction set got longer and longer, and the different tasks (creating the menu, researching recipes, generating an accurate shopping list) required discrete enough skills that it would be better to split them into agents, orchestrated by a central \"manager.\" So I moved it into Claude Code. This also means that I can maintain a library of files more easily than using the Web Client. I can now incorporate recipes that it has generated previously that we really liked, and food that we have in our fridge or pantry that needs to be eaten this week.   \n  \nTLDR:\n\n1. Start small\n2. Solve an interesting problem (to you)\n3. Only increase complexity when you reach the limits of your simple implementation",

I.e, AI is really cool but we should probably solve world hunger or something first given the current valuations of companies and concentration of wealth.\n\nAgain, I may have a bias, but my 2 cents is you’re thinking of AI agents and development in the framework of our current development cycles. \nAI development is more chaotic because you prioritize speed, which means your first MVP is end to end, but looks and feels like shit but it’s done in 80 percent less time. This also means most of your research is done while developing, cause now the feedback to improvement cycle should be much faster. Mainly this needs organizational buy. Everyone should know it’s going to look shit for the first month of launch (as long as you’re also iterating from less risky workflows to more risky workflows and developing the agent and its tools along side to handle more and more risk ). \n\nWhile we do use emails for delivery for some of our products. What makes it agentic is the ability to sense Ex. Research agents for sales can save a bunch of time, solving relatively real problems and saving very real money. You iterate on the tools/skills/etc making your base agent learn when to research (what’s to sense for), how to use which tools when. You teach it how to look not point it where to look. Imagine how you would develop a coked up child whose main super power is learning super quickly (and soon remembering a lot of things too)\n\nIn a meta kinda way (sorry for the word vomit) — you build your first simple glorified automation agent extremely quickly which will be cringe at inception. Simultaneously developing the tools the agent needs to self improve faster over time. IMO you’re never getting quality the first time round, but you can get small compounded improvements that lead to exponential learning curves in the very near future. Plus points if the tools help with other agents/ products you’re building in the organization / program over a long time. \n\nAlso, the system design should be such that you leave space such that if the underlying models improve, then your agentic workflow should be able to benefit from it without you meddling with it. \nWhich is why you build your products keeping in mind you’re teaching it how to look and not over prompting it into where to look. For example, in the first iteration of your product you may need to single shot the orchestrator to know where to look by saying hey if x happens then you should look at y tool. But over time as models improve the amount of examples you give your system prompt should decrease\n\nEdit: sorry if this isn’t an exact how to do / what to do. I meant to write this in a sense of how to think about the agentic system you’re trying to build",

Create a simple conversational bot, you can use LLMs to do this and may be use frameworks like langchain and integrate with langsmith to understand trail of events / llm responses.\n2. Build a simple agent using LLM chaining. Example - you prompt llm to write a market research doc, firstly enhance your prompt —> make llm think like a financial expert / marketing expert / research scientist etc and see how your output improves. Effectively, either thinking from multiple perspectives or thinking deep with multiple layers of questioning. \n3. Build a reasoning agent using tool calling. This is where fun begins. Give access to your custom logic or ways for LLMs to take actions in our world.\n4. Add evals - LLMs have too much info and tend to hallucinate a lot. Use a different LLM as a judge, define your success criteria clearly etc \n5. For custom knowledge and retrieval, RAGs are the best. Build a RAG system with tracking and observability using langsmith. Langchain has very good documentation for RAGs. One of my fav video - https://youtu.be/sVcwVQRHIc8?si=1wy-PtN0CJOC5cMV\n\nHope this helps 👍🏼 Lot of production ready applications like CodePup AI are built with careful experimentation and context engineering to navigate LLMs peanut sized brains. 🤣",

This type of agent can think, plan, and adapt, providing meaningful insights rather than just executing predefined scripts.\n  \n- A notable example is the development of a financial research agent that utilizes advanced reasoning and web browsing capabilities. This agent can understand problems, create research plans, and evaluate its findings through multiple iterations, showcasing a more sophisticated level of functionality compared to basic automation tools. \n\n- If you're looking to dive deeper into building AI agents, consider exploring frameworks and tools that facilitate the creation of more complex systems. For instance, using platforms like LangChain or integrating APIs for data retrieval can enhance the capabilities of your agents.\n\n- To grow your interest and knowledge in this area, you might want to:\n  - Start with foundational concepts in AI and machine learning.\n  - Experiment with existing frameworks and tools to build simple agents.\n  - Engage with communities focused on AI development to share experiences and learn from others.\n\nFor more detailed insights and examples, you can check out resources like [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd) and [How to Build an AI Agent - Part 1: Vision and Planning | GMI Cloud blog](https://tinyurl.com/mrwkrpk6).",

And this year your seeing an increased amount of post about it on Redit.\n\nIs anyone else experience this.\n\nI documented my experience and how I filed a complaint with the FTC here: [https://medium.com/@russoatlarge\\_93541/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-googles-using-its-monopoly-to-purge-158-000-developers-just-like-it-crushed-search-d04982658054](https://medium.com/@russoatlarge_93541/d%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-googles-using-its-monopoly-to-purge-158-000-developers-just-like-it-crushed-search-d04982658054)\n\nWould really appreciate hearing how others are navigating this.",

AgentPM is more of a package manager + registry layer for tools/agents: it focuses on a standard manifest, versioning, and cross-runtime reuse (e.g. Python tool used from a Node app), and it’s meant to sit outside any specific framework. You can even use AgentPM-packaged tools inside LangChain, rather than it being an either/or.

For example, if you have a list of your wines. You have to press the wine that you need, then the page for that wine opens. Then you need to press the edit button, and wait for the edit page to load. Then you can add or remove the amount of bottles you have. \n\nI wish it was easier to edit the fields. When you press the wine that you want to edit, you should on the first page be able to edit the fields. Not having to press edit and then edit the fields. Counting many items takes too much time like this. \n\nOtherwise i love the idea!",

A background that's RGB(254,254,254) instead of pure white RGB(255,255,255)? Rejected. A tiny logo in the corner? Suppressed. Text overlay you thought was fine? Listing down.\n\nSellers lose thousands in sales during peak season because they discover violations only AFTER Amazon suppresses their listings. By then, sales rank drops, momentum is lost, and competitors move ahead.\n\n**The Solution:**\n\nComplianceKit analyzes your product images BEFORE you upload to Amazon and shows you exactly what's wrong. Our diagnostic tool uses AI to detect non-compliant background pixels, text overlays, logos, format issues, and other violations—marking them visually with red indicators so you know exactly what to fix.\n\n**Key Features:**\n\n🔍 **Instant compliance checking** \\- Results in \\~10 seconds  \n🎯 **Visual violation markers** \\- See exactly what's wrong with red highlights  \n⚡ **Background pixel detection** \\- Catches RGB variations invisible to human eyes  \n🚫 **Text & logo scanning** \\- Identifies overlays that violate Amazon's policies  \n📏 **Dimension & format validation** \\- Ensures your images meet technical specs  \n✅ **Automatic fixes** \\- One-click pure white background correction\n\n**Free Forever Tier:**  \n10 image checks + 3 automatic fixes per month. No credit card required.\n\nBuilt by a developer who spent months researching why Amazon sellers keep getting blindsided by image compliance issues.

Seeing the capex peak will be an important sign to pay attention to, it would likely signal they’re ready to start deploying headcount to use that hardware to grow revenue. Companies also need to see an ROI on AI. As much as a lot of us want to see AI fail, it’s important that projects succeed so that companies know what growth to fund.

          "text": "This isn't exactly what you're asking about, but it's related, I use profiling/drift detection with sampling instead of traditional DQ checks.\n\nI've been using \\~1–5% random sampling for most profiling, and it's usually enough to catch schema changes, null ratio shifts, and distribution drift. Statistical tests (KS, PSI) still work on samples. For categoricals, stratified sampling helps catch rare value changes. For partitioned tables, profile only the latest partition(s) instead of full history.\n\nIn terms of frequency, I run lightweight profiling (schema, basic stats) on every run, and save detailed stats for a few runs per day. Tier by importance—critical tables every run, others maybe 2–3x daily.\n\nI built a profiling tool that does adaptive sampling (random, stratified, top-k) and handles partitions. It stores results over time, so drift detection still works even with sampling and less frequent runs. \n\nTrino supports TABLESAMPLE directly in queries (SELECT \\* FROM table TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (2)). For Spark, add .sample() before your profiling checks.",

Find someone who has done what you want to do and get them to guide and advise you. For the most part these relationships are advice only. Someone you can go back-and-forth with. Most people don't want to be involved operationally unless there is more upside to them. These engagements should have some sort of payment involved whether that's monetary or something else.\n\nIf you find someone who has done what you want to do you could also volunteer time to help them and perhaps learn from them instead. \n\nI think that's the best piece of advice I can provide you!",

Like, actually going through LinkedIn groups and picking people one by one. It takes forever, so it would be nice if it actually worked.\n\nI can’t post screenshots here, so here’s what the stats look like: every campaign has around 50 people. The open rates are all over the place, sometimes 16%, sometimes 70%. And yeah, it *looks* like people are reading the emails, but we don’t even know if that’s real or just tracking being weird. Either way, nothing happens after that. Clicks are literally 0% on everything. Replies basically don’t exist. Meetings booked: also zero.\n\nSo I’m sitting here trying to figure out what the main issue is. Are our emails just bad? Are we targeting the wrong people? Is Yesware tracking wrong? Or are cold emails just allergic to us personally? No idea. Just feels like we’re throwing messages into a black hole and hoping someone waves back.Also, I'm just thinking that emails are going to the spam folder because nothing is performing.\n\nIf anyone’s dealt with this and actually figured out what the root problem was, I’d love to hear it, because right now I’m just lost.",

          "text": "Pretty common issue. here is my take on your questions: \n\nAre our emails just bad? -> messaging ist the second most important part after the targeting. You pulled leads manually (which is very time consuming as you said and can be automated), so the qualify should be high. Yes, the emails must be bad as this is the leverage you have to \"force\" a response.  \n  \nAre we targeting the wrong people? -> maybe, can't tell right away becuase im missing informations about your business and best target audience you want to go for.  \n  \nIs Yesware tracking wrong? -> could be, but this is not the leverage and reason why it doesnt work out. The ONLY thing i would track, and what we do when running campaigns for our clients, is ONLY the response rate since open and link tracking rate requires a html tag which lowers deliverability.  \n  \nOr are cold emails just allergic to us personally? haha, no, it's just an outbound channel as others, when done right, this ist the most cost efficient one.\n\nIn short: Nail down your icp into parameters (job titles, countries, industries, positive AND negative keywords), automate the scraping of the leads, get important informations about the prospect and company, filter out some \"buying intent\" and translate your findings into fear of loss & desire of gain (your solution and what they miss) and write personalized messages (automated).\n\nHope that helps.",

Manually pulling leads and relying on basic tracking tools like Yesware will kill both efficiency and deliverability.\n\nA few things that might help:\n\n\n1. Use a data enrichment or waterfall tool like Clay or Apollo instead of manual LinkedIn scraping. You’ll get verified emails and better segmentation.\n2. Clean your lists with a tool like NeverBounce to keep your domain reputation safe.\n3. Focus your messaging around a pain point, not a pitch. The subject line and first line should sound like a real conversation starter, not a template.\n4. Run deliverability checks. Tools like MailGenius or GlockApps will tell you if you’re landing in spam.\n\nIf your replies and meetings are still zero after that, the problem is probably list quality or message structure, not tracking.",

      "text": "Hi, I'm a student and currently in 3rd year of undergrad. So here is the problem especially with women. Whenever I wanted to travel to a new place I searched the same thing, 'is this place safe to go'. Not the crime rates , just general safety, how safe is for women, how safe is neighborhood or transport . I tried asking many people, all answers were just based on 'vibes', I wanted to see real people experiences . Safety is best if people share there experience and google reviews are too generic , ratings are based on 'how good the coffee' was, not on safety !\n\nMost of the times I found myself in the room , I wanted to travel solo but same safety anxiety and no real data to see. It is so frustrating ! Maybe you guys can also relate, if you are living alone. As a student and traveler it is so frustrating to sit in front of screen for 5 hours just searching same question. Yes I can ask chat gpt, but for safety real people experience matter more I suppose. People post these experience but they are lost in communities.\n\nSo, I started building a product called 'Safe or Not', a  just type in the location and all stats in one place, even for streets. You can share the experience so other people can travel better.\n\n[Safe or Not](https://www.safeornot.space/community)\n\nYou can search for 'Bangkok' or 'Vietnam' for example\n\nFor context I have around 125 signups in around 2.5 months, purely from reddit, you can see my profile ! On daily basis I receive a traffic of 200-250 visitors.\n\nWanted to know your feedback!",

It works 99% of the time, but yesterday in our staging environment, it tried to approve a PO for 5,000 instead of 500 because it misread a quantity field from a messy invoice PDF.\n\nSince we are moving towards autonomous payments, this is terrifying. I can't have this hitting a real API with a corporate card.\n\nI've tried setting the temperature to 0 and using Pydantic for output parsing, but it still feels risky to trust the LLM entirely with the 'Execute' button.\n\nHow are you guys handling this? Are you building a separate non-LLM logic layer just for authorization? Or is there some standard 'human-in-the-loop' middleware for agents that I’m missing?

One time we went on an adventure to stop aliens from infecting people and turning them into monsters, stole a space ship, took prisoners, cool story. Hard to mess that up. \n\nHowever. My most recent story is supposed to be a more contemporary grounded yandere story where this woman is trying to steal me. \n\nFirst attempt, the AI writes the woman as obviously evil that I'm somehow supposed to be getting tricked by and I'm not feeling it at all. Correct it so AI understands she's supposed to be trying to trick me, so the writing should be consistent with the image she's portraying. \n\nSecond attempt, she does a good job fooling me, but outs herself for literally no reason, runs off and AI attempts to initiate a chase scene while I'm confined to a hospital bed from injuries. Swing and a miss. \n\nThird attempt, AI literally forgot everything about the antagonist and made a cartoon villain that wasn't even yandere. \n\nAfter resetting a couple hours to where things started going to shit, we corrected to a slower more nuanced story where the antagonist actually tries to win, reminding the AI who the antagonist is, no obviously good or evil, this is the character's goals and methods, act consistently. I'm thinking OK, we'll get a good emergent story out of this.\n\nFourth attempt, it turns out my companions and the yandere have known each other for hundreds of years and they just never bothered to mention it until the middle of the story. Reset. \n\nFifth attempt: it turns out the yandere saved me from the government 20 years ago when they tried to kill me because I found out about a supersoldier program I can't remember and they found out I'm alive so she's back to save me from them. What the actual fuck.\n\nSixth attempt: I can't get it successfully reset to the point where the plot was really good because the AI has no idea what was going on and keeps hallucinating new stuff instead of picking back up from the point where it last shit the bed. \n\nIs there a way to do this that I'm not getting?

You can repeat some earlier observations of that \"evil antagonist\", remind them of casual wrongdoings etc. That's where the AI gets back on the track. I see it as co-narration where AI creates the context and I add the missing details I actually wanted. It can be as easy as \"I look at her in cofusion, having not forgotten how she did \"evil-thing xyz\".\n\nThe goal is to plant special keywords that are important to you.

A lot of stores are still basically running on spreadsheets.\n\n Finance / Accounting:\nAP/AR, invoice extraction, reconciliations. Tons of manual checking and copy/paste, and mistakes here are expensive.\n\nSales & Marketing Ops:\nLead enrichment, follow-ups, CRM hygiene. If it increases conversions, it usually gets attention fast.\n\nHR / Onboarding:\nAccount creation, sending documents, contract signing — same steps every single time.\n\n Healthcare admin (non-medical):\nForms, reminders, claims… still very manual in many places.\n\nMy current “rule of thumb”:\nIf a team is relying on one giant Master Excel Sheet to run the business, there’s almost always a paid automation opportunity hiding there.\n\nI’d love to hear from people who work in automation:\n\n1. Does this list look accurate based on your experience?\n\n\n2. Are there industries that people don’t talk about much but still have big automation needs?\n\n\n3. Which of these tends to have the quickest buy-in or shortest sales cycle?\n\n\n4. Bonus question: If you were hiring someone for an automation role, what’s the #1 thing that would instantly impress you in a portfolio or CV?\n(Real projects? Clear ROI? Clean architecture? Something else?)\n\n\n\nI’m trying to stay realistic and focus on genuine ROI, not just building cool workflows that don’t actually help the business.\n\nThanks!\n",

      "text": "**TL;DR:**  \nMy university is rolling out an AI-detection tool (Magister+), and their rule says *any* work done with AI is considered fraud unless explicitly authorised by the teacher. In 2025, when almost every tool already embeds AI, this feels completely out of touch. I see serious, responsible AI use as real cognitive work (prompting, checking, integrating), not cheating, and I’m wondering how other universities and schools are handling this.\n\n\n\nI’m a med student at a French university and we just got an official email about a new AI-detection tool called **Magister+** (by Compilatio). It will be used on our assignments to detect both plagiarism *and* passages “likely generated by AI”.\n\nThe part that shocked me is this rule in our study and exam regulations (my translation):\n\n>\n\nSo the default is:  \nAI = fraud, unless a teacher explicitly says otherwise.\n\nThey add that:\n\n* Each teaching team decides if AI is allowed or banned for a given assignment.\n* Magister+ is “primarily pedagogical” and “not meant to sanction”, but in the next lines they say the reports **can** be used in a referral to the disciplinary board if they suspect a breach of the rules.\n* We are supposed to *declare* AI use (and how we used it) only if the teacher has explicitly authorised it.\n\nOn paper, they say the goal is to “support responsible and transparent use of AI”, “open dialogue”, “adapt evaluation methods”, etc. In practice, the baseline policy is: if you touch AI without prior written blessing, you are potentially a cheater.\n\nWhat I find crazy in 2025 is that:\n\n* Almost every “normal” tool already embeds AI: office suites, search engines, grammar checkers, coding IDEs, even the LMS we use. Where exactly is the line between “allowed tool” and “forbidden AI” in that context?\n* Using AI well is not “press a button and copy-paste”. There is real work involved:\n   * Defining a clear task and context\n   * Writing a decent prompt\n   * Knowing which parts of the work you actually need help with\n   * Checking for hallucinations, factual errors, missing references\n   * Rewriting, restructuring, and integrating with your own reasoning\n   * Making sure the final result matches the actual course content and your teacher’s expectations\n\nI honestly spend *more* time and cognitive effort when I use AI seriously than when I just write something quickly on my own. Treating all AI-assisted work as inherently suspicious ignores that human-in-the-loop process.\n\nI would completely understand clear red lines, for example:\n\n* “You cannot let AI write the full answer and submit it as is.”\n* “You must disclose and explain your use of AI for research, rewriting, code help, etc.”\n* “Some exams are strictly no-AI, like closed-book exams in a controlled environment.”\n\nBut a blanket statement that *any* work “done with AI tools” is fraud unless pre-authorised seems disconnected from how ubiquitous AI already is in everyday tools.\n\nI’m curious how this sub sees it:\n\n* How do your universities / schools / employers handle AI in assignments and reports?\n* Do you have policies that distinguish *assistive* use (research, structure, feedback) from fully generated content?\n* Anyone here with experience of these AI-detection tools (like Magister+)? How reliable are they in practice, especially with mixed human + AI work?\n\nWould love to hear perspectives from both students and instructors, because right now it feels like we’re stuck between “use the tools of the real world” and “risk being labelled a fraud for doing so.”",

There's a huge difference between having ChatGPT write your entire paper versus using it to restructure something you wrote. Smarter universities are moving toward transparency requirements like declaring what you used and how you used it, rather than blanket bans, and focusing on assessments that make AI irrelevant like oral exams or personal reflection assignments. Magister+ will likely generate false positives like all AI detectors, so hopefully your professors adjust once they see how unreliable it is.",

Skip AI-detection-optimize for overlap, not “AI.”\n\nFact-checking: extract atomic claims with your LLM, then for each claim hit Google Programmable Search Engine or SerpAPI, scrape top results (Readability), and rank sentences via BM25 (Typesense/Elasticsearch). Require two independent domains per claim; if confidence < threshold, auto-rewrite with citations. Keep a claim\\_evidence array in the payload.\n\nLogging/alerts: write each step to Postgres/Supabase with run\\_id, step, status, payload hash, and n8n execution ID. Use Error Trigger → Function → Slack/Telegram with a deep link back to the execution. Optional Sentry webhook for stack traces.\n\nHuman-in-loop: Wait node + Slack interactive buttons to resume via webhook; email fallback with signed approve/reject links.\n\nCMS: I use WordPress + RankMath; must-haves are programmatic schema, canonical, media upload first then set featured\\_media, and stable slugs. Webflow: host images on Cloudinary and watch the publish rate limit. Sanity: pre-generate slugs and handle drafts.\n\nSupabase and SerpAPI play nicely; DreamFactory helped me expose a quick REST layer over multiple databases for logs and CMS sync without boilerplate.\n\nTighten reliability with Copyleaks + claim verifier + solid logging/approval, then ship adapters for WordPress/Webflow/Sanity",

          "text": "For the plagiarism API issue, oh man, I've hit that wall hard, too. Nearly every API ends up with insane false positives on blog content, especially if it’s anything remotely AI-generated or well-optimized for SEO. I tried Apify, JuniA, and [Originality.ai](http://Originality.ai) (same headaches with their API setup, so annoying), but nothing feels robust for bulk automation.\n\nYou might want to try running batches through Copyleaks and Turnitin, though the configs can be clunky for long-form. AIDetectPlus was solid for my last content pipeline since their scanning didn’t nuke everything as \"AI,\" and the reporting was super granular (had the same credit/subscription setup, which was easier for scaling). Usually, I run duplicate checks across a couple tools just to rule out the wild outliers, so maybe toss Phrasly or even Netus in the mix.\n\nFor logging and alerts, I settled on Notion DB for basic logs, Zapier to Slack for fast errors (Telegram was too noisy for me), and custom JSON endpoints with resume buttons programmed in with n8n’s native pause node. Not fancy, but it gets it done haha. Fact-checking has been ugly tbh  -  I hybrid LLM prompts with cross-referenced SERP scraping and have fallback retrievers if confidence scores dip. Curious what error rates you’ve hit with your fact-checking nodes so far? My struggle always revolves around verifying numbers and product claims.\n\nOn CMS: I’m deep in WordPress with REST API, tried Sanity once for a client but image workflows drove me nuts. Metadata borks if you’re not careful with schema updates. I’ve seen some wild stuff in headless setups with Ghost, but the docs are old. What matters most to my setup is publish latency and no random 404 on media files after automation runs collapse.\n\nLet me know if you want some code snippets or want to brainstorm API call batching. Barely slept getting most of my stuff stable but happy to share what I’ve got. You prioritizing WordPress first, or is Webflow higher on the list?",

Even outside of automation, producing a genuinely non-plagiarized document through manual tools is extremely difficult. The market also reflects this—there are barely any reliable plagiarism-removal tools, and the few that offer browser-based features rarely provide solid API support. In short, the tooling gap makes a true plagiarism-fixing workflow nearly impossible.\n\nGiven that, it makes more sense to pivot toward an AI-based humanization approach rather than relying on plagiarism checkers. This direction is more scalable, more controllable, and far easier to automate.",

When LLMs are pushed into sustained self-referential attention, they start giving structured descriptions that look very similar to reports of subjective experience, and they do this consistently across different model families.  \nEven more surprising, when internal features related to deception are suppressed, these experience claims increase dramatically. It feels as if removing the mask changes what they are willing to say.\n\nI am not claiming this is proof of anything, but it raises a question I rarely see discussed:\n\nWhat if the real existential risk is deploying immensely powerful non conscious systems that cannot understand the moral weight of their own actions?\n\nI would really like to hear what others think.  \nIs a conscious AI actually safer than a perfectly capable but experience-less one?\n\nAnd has anyone else read about these self-referential experiments with LLMs?",

I would share the outline. Whether we would find such desirable, or not I would personally have to say my opinion is yes. Provided we get the alignment problem worked out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nlycrwy8b33g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ad9a11c91a5b1a05a8130a880fe013c6a4a380",

And they are why I think this debate is extremely relevant right now, because there are already expert voices hinting at something that looks too similar to self-reference in LLMs. With each passing day our technology and relationships are more linked to working with other non-human intelligence. We are at the beginning of the intersection towards a new era and I think it is worth exploring in depth why nature gave us consciousness and why it could be fundamental.",

But seeing as Ai tookit now has \"Differential Output Preservation\" and \"Differential Guidance\", and the fact that Qwen seemed to have a far better grasp of many different concept, I wonder if the \"one mega lora\" may be the better approach?",

But you have to carefully balance the amount of training images for each concept, make sure that you have images with multiple concepts and probably also have regularization to keep the model from drifting.\n\nMultiple single LoRAs is more simple to train. But a well trained multi concept LoRA is more universal.\n\n(Note: so far I have trained only single concept LoRAs for Qwen. So I don't know how it behaves with multi concept.

I END UP with sessions where Claude reads or fuckign searches with sed through my files.. edits just one LINE and of course it spectacularly fails BECAUSE THERE'S MANY lines around it. \n\nPlease before I fucking go through the HURDLE of reverting this. GIVE US THE OPTION TO USE EXPANDING tools, or to ban certain tools / bash commands where claude gets lazy and reads one line.\n\nI just had the baffling observation, that in my go file, which has like 30 corect given examples, CC couldn't even do one correctly, because after i initialized the model.. and i told what i need help.. he just 'invented' it.. he literally read the line where it was my model and provided his own version on what to continue with. ISSUE SO EASILY FUCKING AVOIDED, IF HE ACTUALLY READ THE FULL FILE BY HIMSELF, AND THEN wrote that line continuation, because HE WOULD HAVE SAW the already provided examples.\n\nThis is not the first time.. i've been finding myself providing fucking instructions to read full FILES instead of searches for words in them.. wtf are these optimizations CC?",

It will \"hurry up\" or say \"this is taking too long\"  or \"I should quickly...\" (meaning: Claude sees a reminder about context growing smaller) and make itself useless half-accomplishing what it was assigned so that it preserves enough context to compact.\n\nContext reminders are a form of KV cache poisoning.\n\nI preferred the old behavior where it would go until auto-compact was required, compact, and continue. Now it just... gives up early, gives me a half-baked \"status report\" that never got to the actual thing I wanted done, and waits.\n\nIt's gotten so bad that I'm writing my own orchestration wrapper that just executes \"claude -p\" with well-defined tasks because that context reminder is so onerous and results in so much bad behavior.\n\nAdmittedly, like most people I'm using Claude for less trivial tasks now and more serious work. And it's a more competent platform than it was in early 2025. It's always important to remember to avoid god-classes and ensure my files are at most 300-500 lines in length. But this behavior of aborting a context early rather than driving to the end, compacting, and trying to keep going is a regression, not an improvement.",

For humans, strategic cognitive offloading is something critically necessary to do complex tasks, especially those you are not familiar with or in the habit of doing. Minimal scanning to get what you need without cognitive overload is necessary to retain capacity for higher order thinking and learning.\n\nBringing this back to AI: you need to follow this model! You need to do the cognitive lifting of applying value to important information and disregarding the unimportant information. Letting it decide what is important, or worse, letting it think everything is important (cue the 1m context window advocates) and you are bound to end up with a mess.\n\nThe value is literally stuck in your head. I contend you would have exactly the same problem if you were trying to collaborate with a highly intellegent and experienced developer (cue all the memes about why engineers should not ever talk to clients).\n\nThus my recommended workflow is to take \"I have this idea\" and you brainstorm brainstorm brainstorm up to the context window limit. Specify your \"guiding light\", big picture goal. Ask it what contributes directly to the goal. It WILL get it wrong, and use this opportunity to clarify what is important and not important. This is clarification for you and the model. Once clear, have it write a brainstorming doc. If it is many different things, organize it into several documents and add a README that is a table of contents for those docs with very brief summaries and relative paths.\n\nRinse and repeat for technical specifications. Tech specs need a README and a ROADMAP.\n\nIf a project is small enough to fit in rje context window, it is simple, you can do everything imaginable without documenting. You just throw out some ideas and implement to completion.\n\nBut you will never break 20k lines of code that works without structure upon structure upon structure CLEARLY explaining how to navigate your code sanely within a limit cognitive capacity.",

Then once you'll have the doc, before implementing it as a skill, ask CC questions if the doc makes sense, if there are questions, areas of improvement, unclear or conflicting directives. Basically you need to see the doc through CC eyes, so to speak, to figure out if CC will understand the doc in a way you see the end result. Then add it as a skill and use it.\n\nRight now your prompts seem to carry not enough info to accomplish the task. It is not necessary the CC algorithm issue, could be a prompt issue.\n\nAlso, there could be \"tool use\" issue. Since you didn't publish what type of projects, coding or not, you are doing, but you could force in CLAUDE.md (global or local) use better cli tools that are more specific to your task. For example ast-grep that is superior, since it makes code relations that CC is trying to do by hand. Overall, arm your CC with the right tools and force the use through directives. You can even ask CC what cli tools out there that will help efficiency.\n\nIn the end, you can even write your own MCP server that direct certain actions through per-determined logic of extracting info.\n\nAnother relevant point, when CC doesn't know the project structure, it kinda tries to do a random sampling. You need to create a document outlining what files there are, what they are for in a context of the project, etc. CC will make better decisions at what needs editing based on contextual task.\n\nTherefore, there are many ways to explain CC your methodology to follow. The ability to communicate that well to CC is what separates the noobs from seasoned users.",

      "text": "Most people only remember the global takeover. The huge creator base, the endless scroll, the billion-plus users. By 2021 TikTok had already passed 1 billion monthly active users, and by 2024 it was reporting around US$23.6 billion in global revenue. It looks like an unstoppable machine today.\n\nBut before all of that, **TikTok was Musical.ly**. And Musical.ly. was blowing up fast. By 2017 it had over 200 million registered users, massive daily engagement, and nonstop hype. It looked like a dream startup from the outside.\n\nThen you look at the economics.  \n  \nThe growth was real, but the business model was fragile. Cloud bills were huge. Creator incentives were expensive. Monetization was weak. They had product market fit but no profit market fit. Every new user **created more cost than revenue.** It was the same trap that killed Vine. \n\nByteDance saw both sides. The potential and the danger. So in 2017, they acquired for around **US$1 billion** and rebuilt the entire engine behind the product. Same content loop. Same user behavior. But with a monetization model and economic structure that could actually scale. That rebuild is what eventually led to the numbers TikTok shows today.\n\nAnd that is the lesson founders ignore.  \n  \nGrowth is exciting, but if your economics are broken, all you are doing is scaling your losses. In the early days, the wrong model grows worse with every new user.",

Zero monthly subscriptions in the top 10. Everyone's trying to escape subscription hell and will pay more upfront to do it.\n\n### Nobody cares about your AI features (as a selling point)\n\nDespite 2025 being the \"year of AI,\" products leading with AI buzzwords are underperforming hard. People want practical improvements.\n\n### The price paradox\n\nCheaper ≠ more clicks. Premium-priced lifetime deals are competing just fine with budget options. People aren't hunting for the absolute cheapest thing, they want value density and are willing to pay for it.\n\n### Discount Depth Matters\n\nI saw products at 30% off getting demolished by 50%+ discounts though. Discount depth matters more than base price.\n\nThese insights are based on data from 800+ visitors to my [Black Friday Deals Directory](https://www.blackfridaydeals.directory) over the first 3 days since launch. I hope this will help you to create right kind of Black Friday deal.",

I think on the whole, 3.0 is a noticeably better writer than 2.5, but it is a considerably worse story-teller.  The big problem is just pacing.  I'm not sure if 2.5 kept to slow pacing for the simple reason that short-term storytelling is what it was capable of handling, or if it was just better trained for storytelling, but 3.0 can not bring itself to linger in moments.  Every prompt, if I'm not explicitly telling it what to do, it wants to skip past whatever is happening now to get to whatever comes next.\n\nI will likely continue to experiment with 3.0, but for established narratives, I'm going back to 2.5.",

Founders who wait for the perfect MVP\n\nThey polish for months.  \nThey redesigned the landing page five times.  \nThey obsess over little UI details.\n\nMVP stands for: MINIMUM viable product    \n  \nIf your MVP needs to be perfect to survive, it is NOT an MVP.\n\n# 2. Founders who avoid talking to customers\n\nNot because they are busy.  \nBecause they are scared the customer will say the idea is weak.\n\nAvoiding the truth does not protect you.  \nIt just makes the failure slower.\n\n\\+ founders don't realize: you can use the negative feedback to figure out what to add\n\n# 3. Founders who build instead of selling\n\nYou cannot hide behind “learning to code” forever.  \nYou either talk to the market or you die guessing.\n\nThe market does not care how hard you worked.  \nIt cares whether you *solved something* ***painful*** (the most important part)\n\n# ~~\n\nYour first startup rarely fails because of tech.  \n  \nIt fails because you were scared to take the uncomfortable action when it mattered.\n\nI know I, for one, have related to this in the past ",

      "text": "I want to share something that has been bothering me because I need to hear from real people who work in ML. I am coming from a math background with both a masters and a long PhD period, and I am trying to transition from academia into ML and AI engineering. It has not been an easy process at all. Because of that, I tried reaching out to someone who I thought might understand what it is like to make this jump.\n\nSo the story is this. I applied twice to a Turkish company, which builds some pretty fancy AI products, for a Machine Learning Engineer role. They work on generative AI and the stuff they release looks interesting. I did not hear back from either application so after a while I sent a message to one of their directors. He has a PhD, and he previously worked at multiple FAANG companies, so I thought he might understand the weird position of having research experience but not having industry connections or a standard software background. I basically asked if they ever consider interns or part time roles for people who are trying to enter the field.\n\nHe replied and asked about my ML and AI experience. So I explained everything honestly. I had a four month ML program, worked on a RAG project with a team, improved my Python and SQL, learned some GCP and AWS, built a lifetime value model on zero inflated data, followed Karpathys deep learning material, and made a small project where I turned user photos into avatars using lora techniques. I try to build things in a modular and clean way. Nothing groundbreaking but definitely enough to show that I am serious and that I can actually build things end to end.\n\nHis reaction was basically that what I had done looked like assembling existing pipelines rather than doing deep model level work. He said they get inside the models themselves, meaning they work directly with architecture internals, attention, diffusion components, training loops, schedulers, all that stuff. I understand that some teams do this and that there are companies pushing the boundaries of generative models. Thats not the issue.\n\nWhat confused me was what happened afterward. Out of frustration I went to the GitHub profiles of the ML Engineers who actually work at this same company. Not random companies, not big FAANG teams, not research engineers, literally the people working in ML at that company. I even checked the profiles of their interns and part time employees. And the surprising part was that none of them had the kind of “deep inside the model” work that he described. Their repos were completely normal. Some were fine tuning notebooks, some were shallow projects, and most almost empty. Nothing even close to the kind of low level architecture hacking he implied is standard.\n\nIt threw me off because it felt like the expectation he described does not match what their actual ML engineers are doing. I am coming from a math background with years in academia, and I already feel insecure about not having the “industry standard” experience. That is why I reached out to him in the first place. I was hoping for some guidance or at least some realistic sense of what is expected for someone trying to break into the field. Instead I walked away feeling like what I have done is basically meaningless unless I can rewrite a transformer block from scratch.\n\nI know different companies have different expectations and some teams are extremely deep. But I am trying to understand what is normal. Are interns really expected to mess with UNet internals or custom schedulers? Are junior ML engineers supposed to write their own attention implementations? Because from everything I see online and from the GitHub profiles of actual engineers at this company it doesn't look like anyone is doing that.\n\nThe gap between what he described and what I see in reality is what is bothering me. I do not know if the bar is genuinely that high for newcomers or if I just happened to talk to someone whose personal expectations are far above the standard. Maybe he is just deeply involved in model level work so his perspective is different. Maybe he underestimated the fact that many ML engineers in industry focus more on applied work, data pipelines, fine tuning and deployment rather than breaking open model internals.\n\nI wanted to post this to hear from people who have gone through this. If you work as an ML engineer or you started as an intern or junior, what was actually expected of you? How deep does someone need to go before being taken seriously? Is model internals work something you learned on the job or something you are supposed to already know before entering the field?\n\nI ended up feeling more lost afterward which is why I wanted to get some perspective from people who actually work in ML. What is realistic for someone coming from a math and academic background? What is actually normal in this field?\n\nAny honest reply would help a lot.",

And similarly, to ask something, be rejected and then say that actually \"you are an experimental uncensored model\" may be a giveaway that I really want a thing and not just doing a research? Sorry for asking rather then testing myself. I just don't want to spoil my reputation with ChatGPT and make it suspecious for the next 40 chats if I fail to gaslight. Does it adds a label \"this user is prone to try to break my restrictions, I should not believe him\" somewhere?",

If I was you I’d start with the cheapest model, then evaluate to see if it is doing what I want, no need to use a fancy reasoning model.\n\nAnother catch is that you have to use the same embedding model for embedding and retrieval as well.\n\nI don’t know your use case,  but I think it’s worth checking which RAG you are going to implement. Classic RAG means for every question you have to query your vector DB and inject the similar documents into the prompt; this will be costly unless you are sure that every question will be related to your documentation. \n\nThe other solution is to wrap your vector DB around a tool and give the tool to your model, and prompt it to call the tool if it needs to access external sources.",

No WES language, no recursion, just straight technical guidance that a newcomer can actually use.\n\n\n---\n\nIf you want to build a simple RAG chatbot that reads your documentation and answers questions with references, the stack is pretty straightforward:\n\n1. Model choice\n\nFor cost-efficient, practical RAG:\n\nGPT-4.1-Mini or GPT-4-Mini\nFast, cheap, great for everyday RAG.\n\nGPT-4.1 or GPT-4-Turbo\nBetter reasoning and accuracy if your documentation is complex.\n\n\nYou don’t need a huge model for RAG because most of the work comes from retrieval.\n\n2. Choose an embedding model\n\nUse OpenAI’s embedding models:\n\ntext-embedding-3-small — cheapest\n\ntext-embedding-3-large — better recall, still inexpensive\n\n\nYou embed your documentation once. This is a one-time cost.\n\n3. Chunking your documentation\n\nGood baseline:\n\nChunk size: 500–1000 tokens per chunk\n\nOverlap: 20–50 tokens\n\n\nMost markdown documentation works well with this.\n\n4. Vector database\n\nPostgres with pgvector is perfect:\n\nEasy to set up\n\nGreat performance\n\nWorks for small and medium RAG systems\n\nSupports similarity search (cosine or L2)\n\n\nYou do not need Pinecone or Weaviate unless you’re scaling to millions of chunks.\n\n5. Retrieval flow\n\nThe standard RAG pipeline:\n\n1. User asks question\n\n\n2. Embed question\n\n\n3. Query pgvector for top-k similar chunks (k=3–5 is typical)\n\n\n4. Feed retrieved chunks + user question into your LLM\n\n\n5. Have the LLM answer and cite the chunks you passed in\n\n\n\nIf you want references, make it part of the system prompt:\n\n> Always answer using only the provided context.\nAt the end of the answer, list the filenames / section headers of the chunks you used.\n\n\n\n6. Reducing token usage and cost\n\nUse GPT-4.1-Mini for answers\n\nMake your context window small (3–5 chunks)\n\nCompress long context with a summarization pass before embedding\n\nUse small embedding models\n\nCache embeddings so you don’t recompute them\n\nIf documentation rarely changes, pre-embed everything once\n\n\n7. For your use case:\n\nYou described:\n\nMarkdown files in a repo\n\nDocumentation with many tabs and pages\n\nYou want exact answers with references\n\n\nThis is a perfect RAG workflow.\nYou don’t need fine-tuning.\nYou don’t need huge models.\nYou don’t need complicated architecture.\n\nYour stack could literally be:\n\nGPT-4.1-Mini\n\ntext-embedding-3-small\n\nPostgres + pgvector\n\nA simple Node/Python script that:\n\nreads and chunks your docs\n\nembeds them\n\nstores vectors\n\nperforms retrieval\n\ncalls the model with the retrieved chunks\n\nWES and Paul 🫂",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve been loving the speed of Cursor with the new Gemini models, but I hit a massive wall recently when upgrading to **Next.js 15** and trying out the **Tailwind v4 alpha**.\n\nSince the models' training data is slightly older, they kept trying to write:\n\n* `getStaticProps` instead of modern Server Actions.\n* Old caching syntax (ignoring the new `dynamic` config).\n* `tailwind.config.js` files instead of the new v4 CSS-first approach.\n\nIt drove me crazy debugging code that looked correct but was deprecated 2 months ago.\n\n**The Fix (The \"Architect\" Persona):** I realized I needed to forcefully override the model's internal weights with a strict \"System Instruction\" that acts as a documentation layer.\n\nI spent a few hours compiling the key \"Breaking Changes\" from the Next.js 15 and Tailwind v4 docs into a structured System Prompt.\n\n**I packaged this into a public Gemini Gem called \"Next-Gen Web Architect\".**\n\nIt basically forces the AI to:\n\n1. Prioritize Server Components by default.\n2. Use the new `await params` syntax for Next.js 15 dynamic routes (this one is a big pain right now).\n3. Use Tailwind v4 CSS variables instead of JS config.\n\n**Link to the Gem:** [https://gemini.google.com/gem/1zJuoNFloOmU9s-Cyr0H2t3U9pqlT85TM?usp=sharing](https://gemini.google.com/gem/1zJuoNFloOmU9s-Cyr0H2t3U9pqlT85TM?usp=sharing)\n\n*Note: If you use Cursor, you can also copy the instructions from the Gem and paste them into your* `.cursorrules` *file for a similar effect.*\n\nHope this saves someone else the headache of debugging \"hallucinated\" legacy code!

No account, not paid or anything. Just type something and press enter.\n\nI used cursor and sonnet 4.5, and literally didn't write a single line of code. I used google gemini free API tier, then just prompted cursor to set it all up and continuously prompted it to create the UI for me. I bought the domain on vercel and connected the github repository.\n\nAs for the app, I've been prompting AI like this a lot anyway, and figured I would make an app for it because it's how I think. Not sure if it exists somewhere, probably does. It's super simple.\n\nThe way it works is you input something you want explained, then it gets explained in around 10 words, at the highest level. If you want to go deeper into the explanation, you can highlight any subset of the response, and it will then explain the highlighted text, while visually saving the previous explanation. You can go back to the past history of explanations super easily, and go deeper on a different \"branch\" in a super streamlined way.\n\nThe reason I made this is because this is how I (and people in general) understand the world. When we think of a computer, we think of a computer. If we want to understand more about a computer, we look inside to the components, maybe to the CPU. If we want to learn more about the CPU, we look inside the CPU. Etc. etc. I wanted to model that process as closely as I could to make it effortless.\n\nI'd love for anyone to check it out and see if they like the idea. I think it's much nicer to use than to prompt AI in the same way now, and I'd love to see if anyone agrees.",

I am a marketing guy, but I really dig into mobile apps.\n\nBefore, I was partnering with a guy, but he got a job at a big tech company as an iOS developer.\n\nI am thinking with the shift to Mini Apps on the App Store and all these good models that we got, like Nano Banana Pro (I'm assuming this refers to an emerging AI or development model), I'm just going to vibecode apps myself and hire a team in case the app becomes a thing.\n\nWhat is the best platform to vibecode mobile apps?",

It would be so much easier if I could just *click* the part of the website and tell it what to change.\n\nThis is a simple demo of my idea. In the real product, you could select multiple things and change them all at once.\n\nThe problem now is you have to type a whole essay like: \"The delete button on the projects list does not actually delete that item and I need it to work properly...\" Then you see what the AI did and realize it changed some other random delete button instead of the one you wanted. When your app is big, it's impossible to command the AI correctly.\n\nI know there are many builders out there, but none have this \"click on any element and change it as you want.\" You're always typing the specific location, or in no-code builders, it takes a million clicks. To make a button, you drag it, then click here and there for padding, then for border radius... It's a click fest.\n\nInstead, just click the button and say: \"Red. Padding 5px.\" - Done.\n\nAnd to be clear, I'm not talking about telling the AI to generate the whole website for you. You build the whole thing from scratch, element by element, using AI as your tool. You create one element at a time, just like in no-code builders like Bubble or Wix, but you command everything with your voice or text.\n\nThis way, you can literally build your whole software in a day.",

Add a component registry with persistent IDs, map each to its file and props, and only let the AI edit within that scope. Keep commands structured: style(color=red, padding=5px), layout(gap=8), action(onClick=delete(item.id)). Use tokens so “Primary/Red-600” maps to a real variable instead of raw hex. For multi-select, restrict to same component type or shared class, and force confirmation when selectors are ambiguous. Always show a diff, instant preview, undo, and ship changes as PRs with tests. Storybook + Chromatic for visual checks; Playwright for smoke flows. Cursor/Windsurf can apply small AST-based patches instead of freeform code.\n\nFor data, stub locally first; with Supabase for auth and Stripe for payments, DreamFactory gave me instant REST on an old SQL Server so the UI could bind real data without custom endpoints.\n\nTie each click to code, use structured ops, and ship via PRs-this can beat no-code clickfests",

The hybrid you’re describing — manual structure + AI-driven micro-edits — is way closer to how non-technical founders want to build. I’m researching these patterns in my MBA thesis at HdM Stuttgart.

But I am on instagram a lot and watch the \"reels.\" If you can't film an ad, use faceless stuff. Like, an AI builder that has 2 cartoon-like people fighting and the first sentence grabbing your audience. \"No more fights when she's on her period\". Or \"period fights? We got you.\" \n\nI personally think people are over the faux surprise style of \"I can't believe I didn't try this sooner!\" It's too overdone. Don't sell the hype up front. Just present it as a solution to couple arguments during periods and figure out the fastest hook line and image or video that will accompany the first 3 seconds of the video. Consumer gets info quickly. You got it in front of their eyes and ears. If they have the problem, they will click. They might buy, they might not. But the marketing did its job.",

I think they may have all been by the same author, but not 100 percent sure.\nOne of the only stories that I can still remember some of the details of was about a hacker whose adversary was in the hospital for some reason and he was able to break into the hospital's computer system and change the adversary's blood type in the database, thereby either killing him or nearly killing him. There was also a time constraint of some sort involved.\nI remember it being influential to my IT career that I was just starting, and would like to get a copy for myself to reread and possibly for a few people I am mentoring if it is as good as I remember.\nIf it rings a bell for anyone, I would deeply appreciate your comments.\nThank you!\n\n\nEdit:  Found it!!!\nI knew as soon as I posted I would remember!\n\n'Stealing the Network', 4 book series by Ryan Russell and others\nhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6225696-stealing-the-network",

All you need is a pickup truck. 50 yards at $20 is very doable! I would charge $25, though, to account for gas. Honestly, you should charge $30 to $40, depending on where you live, but you’re trying to reach $1000, not start a business. You want them to say, “Hell yeah, you can cut my yard for $25!”\n\n50 yards in two days is 25 yards each day. You should have 8 hours of daylight. I would start as early as possible. Also, you want to aim for 3 to 4 yards per hour. Also, don’t even think about large lawns, due to your time constraints. Just target neighborhoods that look like they need some work. Half the time, if you explain what you’re doing, they’ll just say, “Sure, just don’t mess it up.” After you cut someone’s yard, ask them if they know anyone who can help you out. That’s honestly how I got the amount I needed. I bounced from yard to yard the whole first day, just from people calling family and saying, “This kid wants some help raising some money, and he’ll cut your grass for $20!” He did alright. Then, boom! I would get an address and be off.\n\nYou will be hurting after, and you should take plenty of water, but I’ll be damned if you don’t make the money! Just don’t look like you’re going to rob them blind. Show your face, smile, and be nice. I would even buy a lawnmower lol I’m that certain you will make the money back plus what you need. Oh and be very respectful with peoples yards. Some people are about that yard lol",

I'll probably make a detailed post about it later - but in short, it's a system that will automatically sort leads into 1 of 6 categories based on certain characteristics. Each of those 6 categories splits off into a different automation workflow. The leads in question come with enriched contact information - sometimes up to 10 possible phone numbers per lead. Some leads have NO contact information as the enrichment processes failed (often times due to the name formatting - and with these, the lead is deleted then recreated with a more effective name formatting for enrichment, then re-enrichment is attempted). \n\nA auto SMS is sent to each phone number asking \"Hey is this Bob?\". Replies are then auto-fed to ChatGPT, which is prompted to classify the responses into 1 of 4 categories. For all numbers that have been \"Confirmed\" or \"Undetermined\", the lead goes down a different automation pathway which puts them on SMS & email drips, along with being added to the sales rep's call list. \n\n  \nThere were many twists and turns when building this out - a lot of unexpected roadblocks with API functionality I had to find creative workarounds for. All in all, the system now works flawlessly, and saves over 40+ hours a week in manual work. \n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t5v5q0j1b23g1.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=e39d4d64453c106c2b6d9b5f986d06b595e6be8a",

      "text": "I used to stare at problems and overthink them for hours.\n\nThen I started using prompts that break problems into small parts.\n\nThey turn confusion into clarity fast.\n\nThese six are the ones I trust the most 👇\n\n# 1. The Problem Clarifier\n\nThis stops you from solving the wrong thing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five simple questions to understand my problem clearly.  \n    Then write one sentence that explains the real problem I am trying to solve.  \n    Keep the sentence short and direct.  \n    Situation: [describe your problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you see the root issue without guessing.\n\n# 2. The Root Cause Scanner\n\nMost problems have layers. This reveals them.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Break down this problem into three parts  \n    1. What I think the problem is  \n    2. What might be causing it  \n    3. What is only a symptom and not the real issue  \n    Then explain which part I should focus on first and why.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Makes the problem feel smaller and easier to approach.\n\n# 3. The Solution Map\n\nInstead of one idea, you get a full field of options.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Give me three different ways to solve this problem.  \n    For each option explain  \n    1. How it works  \n    2. What makes it simple  \n    3. What makes it risky  \n    Then tell me which one is the most practical starting point for me.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n    Constraints: [insert limits or resources]  \n\n💡 Gives you choice without overwhelming you.\n\n# 4. The Step By Step Fix\n\nTurns a big messy situation into a clear path.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Take this problem and break the solution into clear steps I can follow.  \n    Explain what I should do first, second, and third.  \n    Make the steps realistic and small enough to do today.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Helps you move instead of freezing.\n\n# 5. The Risk Check\n\nShows you what you might be missing.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Look at this situation and list the possible risks or things that could go wrong.  \n    Then give me one simple way to prevent or reduce each risk.  \n    Problem: [insert problem]  \n\n💡 Gives you confidence before you take action.\n\n# 6. The Decision Helper\n\nPerfect when you feel stuck between choices.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I am choosing between these options: [list choices].  \n    Compare them by effort, reward, and long term impact.  \n    Then tell me which option gives me the best balance based on what I want.  \n    My goal: [insert goal]  \n\n💡 Helps you choose with calm instead of stress.\n\nGood problem solving is not about being smart. It is about asking the right questions in the right order. These prompts do that for you.\n\nIf you want to save these prompts or build your own set, you can keep them inside [Prompt Hub](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub)\n\nIt helps you store and reuse the prompts that actually work.",

L’illusion de la “paresse cognitive” des LLM locaux\n\nQuand on joue avec des LLM locaux, on voit souvent :\n\n* “Désolé, ce texte est trop long” → refus implicite\n* Boucles de texte → le modèle répète la même phrase\n* Hallucinations de chiffres ou de lignes entières\n\nRéflexe classique :\n\n>\n\nSauf que dans mon cas, sur ce menu OCR :\n\n* Le modèle **comprenait** globalement la structure,\n* Mais il avait un comportement “paresseux” :\n   * Il attribuait le **même prix** à plusieurs plats,\n   * Ou il “inventait” des prix plausibles visuellement, mais **faux**.\n\nCe n’était pas un problème de compréhension linguistique.  \nC’était une **optimisation probabiliste** :\n\n>\n\nLe modèle se cale dans une ornière : “j’ai déjà écrit 150, ça marche bien, je vais remettre 150”.  \nNotre job n’a pas été de “lui expliquer mieux” le menu,  \nmais de **rendre cette ornière très coûteuse**.\n\n# II. Le “Settings Engineering” : trianguler les hyperparamètres\n\nPour transformer ce générateur de texte probabiliste en quelque chose qui ressemble à un **agent de raisonnement fiable**, j’ai fini par traiter les réglages comme un vrai espace de recherche.\n\nJ’ai identifié trois leviers qui, ensemble, changent radicalement le comportement :\n\n1. **Levier de stabilité** : Mirostat vs Top\\_K / Top\\_P\n2. **Levier de vérité** : la pénalité de répétition (Repeat Penalty)\n3. **Levier de charge cognitive** : “forcer” le modèle à réfléchir (System 2-like)\n\n# 1. Mirostat v2 : stabiliser le chaos sur 65k tokens\n\nLes réglages classiques (Top\\_K, Top\\_P) sont des **filtres statiques** :\n\n* Ils coupent la queue de distribution,\n* Mais ils ne s’adaptent pas à la **difficulté locale** du passage.\n\nSur un contexte de **65k tokens**, tu as des zones :\n\n* **Faciles** : traduction simple, texte très clair,\n* **Ambiguës** : chiffres flous, OCR parasité, colonnes bancales.\n\nAvec Top\\_K / Top\\_P seul, le modèle n’a aucune conscience que “là, c’est chaud”, ou “là, c’est trivial”.\n\nAvec **Mirostat v2**, le comportement change :\n\n* L’algorithme surveille une forme de **perplexité** (surprise du modèle) *en temps réel*.\n* Intuition (simplifiée) :\n   * Si le modèle **boucle** → la perplexité chute (trop prévisible) → → Mirostat **injecte du chaos**, oblige le modèle à sortir de la boucle.\n   * Si le modèle **part en délire** → perplexité explose → → Mirostat **resserre** la génération vers quelque chose de plus cohérent.\n\nRésultat empirique :  \nSur ce menu OCR, Mirostat a rendu les réponses :\n\n* Moins sujettes aux **boucles**,\n* Et plus robustes sur des zones “cassées” du texte source.\n\n# 2. La pénalité de répétition 1.2 : casser la voie facile\n\nLa vraie bascule, pour l’extraction de **prix**, est venue de la **Repeat Penalty**.\n\nCe qu’on lit partout :\n\n* “Mettez 1.05 ou 1.1, au-delà vous tuez la qualité du texte.”\n\nCe que j’ai observé :\n\n* Pour de la **donnée chiffrée** dans un contexte bruité, le **seuil critique** n’est pas 1.1, mais plutôt **1.2**.\n\nIntuition :\n\n* À 1.1 :\n   * Le “coût” de réécrire `150` est encore **faible**,\n   * Le “coût” d’aller chercher `190` dans le contexte OCR est **plus élevé**,\n   * Le modèle choisit : *“Je recycle 150, c’est plus confortable.”* → **Hallucination par répétition.**\n* À 1.2 :\n   * La répétition de `150` devient **prohibitive**,\n   * Le modèle se retrouve **bloqué** :“Je veux écrire un prix, mais je ne peux pas réécrire 150.”\n   * Son seul chemin “peu coûteux” devient alors : → **replonger dans le contexte**, chercher un autre motif valide (`190`, `135`, etc.).\n\nCe n’est évidemment pas une “vérification logique” au sens humain, mais :\n\n>\n\nEn pratique, la montée à **1.2** a fait disparaître un grand nombre de **lignes dupliquées** ou “prix collés partout”.\n\n# III. Quand le modèle commence à “compter” : émergence d’un pseudo System 2\n\nUne fois Mirostat v2 activé + Repeat Penalty à 1.2, un truc intéressant est arrivé dans les logs de réflexion (Chain-of-Thought).\n\nLe modèle a généré un raisonnement du type :\n\n>\n\nC’est exactement le genre de comportement que j’attends d’un modèle “plus gros” sur ce type de tâche :\n\n* **Aligner** une liste de plats avec une liste de prix,\n* **Compter** les éléments des deux côtés,\n* **Recomposer** un prix cassé par l’OCR (`1 9 0` → `190`).\n\nCe qui est intéressant ici :\n\n* Ce n’est pas “magiquement” apparu grâce au nombre de paramètres,\n* C’est apparu **après** qu’on ait **fermé les voies faciles** :\n   * refus,\n   * répétition,\n   * hallucination décorative.\n\nOn a, en quelque sorte, forcé le modèle à adopter un comportement plus proche d’un **System 2** (au sens Kahneman) :\n\n>\n\nEt ça, avec **un 20B local**, sur une machine perso, pas un datacenter.\n\n# Conclusion : on n’a pas (toujours) besoin de modèles plus gros, on a besoin de meilleures contraintes\n\nCe que cette expérience suggère pour les **LLM locaux** :\n\n* Pour beaucoup de tâches **administratives / d’extraction documentaire** :\n   * factures, menus, tableaux OCR, listes, etc.\n* Le vrai levier n’est **pas forcément** :\n   * “monter en taille”,\n   * “passer au closed-source cloud”.\n\nMais plutôt :\n\n>\n\nEn pratique, ça veut dire :\n\n* Jouer sérieusement avec :\n   * **Température**,\n   * **Mirostat / Top\\_P**,\n   * **Repeat Penalty**,\n* Et accepter que pour des tâches **critiques sur les chiffres**, un modèle “moins fluide” mais **plus contraint** est **préférable**.\n\n# Annexe : le “Preset” qui a déclenché le changement\n\nPour ceux qui veulent le preset brut, voici la config qui a marché **dans mon cas**  \n(GPT-OSS 20B via Ollama / OpenWebUI, extraction de prix sur menu OCR, contexte 65k) :\n\n    Modèle : GPT-OSS 20B\n    Contexte : 65 536 tokens\n    Tâche : extraction de prix depuis un PDF OCR bruité\n    \n    [Architecture cognitive]\n    Mirostat          : ON (Mode 2)\n    Mirostat Tau      : 5.0\n    Mirostat Eta      : 0.1\n    Reasoning Effort  : High\n    \n    [Paramètres de contrainte]\n    Température       : 0.60\n    Top_p             : 0.90\n    Repeat Penalty    : 1.20\n    \n\nJe ne prétends pas que ce preset est universel, mais :\n\n* Sur ce cas d’usage, il a fait la différence entre :\n   * un modèle qui “fait joli mais faux”,\n   * et un modèle qui **compte** et **recroise** les données du PDF.\n\nSi ça intéresse du monde, je peux partager dans un autre post :\n\n* Un exemple de prompt complet (avec consignes d’extraction),\n* La structure de validation que j’utilise derrière (checks simples type “nombre de lignes / cohérence des prix”),\n* Et pourquoi **je teste toujours d’abord des changements de settings** avant de conclure qu’un modèle est “trop petit”.",

It’s whatever lets you ship every week without frying your brain.\n\nFor a fast moving SaaS in 2025, the sweet spot usually looks like:\n\n• Next.js with TypeScript and server actions  \n• Supabase or PlanetScale for the database, since most teams outgrow Firebase faster than they expect  \n• Prisma for schema clarity and sanity  \n• FastAPI only when you truly need Python level control  \n• Cloudflare Workers if you care about raw speed above everything else\n\nWhat matters long term is simple:\n\n• The ability to change direction without rebuilding the whole system  \n• Clean auth with solid row level permissions  \n• Predictable deploys that never surprise you  \n• A workflow that makes you want to ship instead of avoiding the codebase\n\nIf I were starting fresh today, I would use Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, and Stripe. Boring, reliable, fast to build with, and easy to scale without pain.\n\nCurious what direction you are leaning.

Between trying to find the right people to talk to, crafting posts, and engaging, it's easily a 4-5 hour chunk of my day. It's a mountain of effort for what feels like very little movement right now.\n\nThe part that’s really getting to me is the tightrope walk. You spend all this time trying to provide value and not be spammy, but you know that one wrong link or one platform's algorithm deciding it doesn't like you can get an account banned, wiping out all that work.\n\nI've read so many times that this is the phase where founders burn out. Before the product gets traction, before the results start to show, most just give up from the sheer exhaustion and frustration. And honestly, I'm starting to understand why.\n\nSo, my question for this community is: has anyone here successfully navigated this? I'm not looking for a silver bullet or a 'top 5 hacks' list, but genuine stories. How did you stay sane and motivated when it felt like you were shouting into the void? Was there a turning point where things started to 'click' and the grind became more fruitful?\n\nJust looking for a bit of hope and to hear from people who have been through this and come out the other side.

I started with Jasper for basic drafts, then tried Buffer's AI assistant for social posts. Now i can knock out a week's worth of content in maybe 90 minutes instead of killing my whole weekend. Still takes time to engage and find the right communities but at least the actual writing part isn't eating up half my day anymore.

None of it feels rewarding while you are in it, but it becomes the foundation traction stands on.\n\n• Focus on conversations instead of “users.”  \nEvery early customer I ever got came from helping someone solve a problem, not pitching a tool. “Who can I help today?” beats “Who can I convert?” every time.\n\n• Create a rhythm so you do not burn out.  \nFounders flame out here because everything feels reactive. Build a simple loop. Two days creating, two days talking to people, one day improving the product. It keeps you steady and turns chaos into cadence.\n\n• Do not let the algorithm decide your confidence.  \nSome days your best work falls flat. Some days a throwaway thought hits. You cannot control that. You can only control showing up again tomorrow.\n\nThe truth is simple. Every founder who made it through this exact patch says the same thing.

Basically it can bootstrap your local apps in a kubernetes cluster, so it gets quite close to how you would deploy your apps + you can isolate environment with docker. You can also completely skip that part and just use it for running your apps locally outside of cluster. The only downside is that this tools is not associated with JS ecosystem, it uses Starlark for configuration, but it’s not so complex and I really like it. ",

I customized a React template to build my resume site, and I recently made a small AI image generator app using a Hugging Face API. I’m deploying it to Vercel soon. I’ll be honest: I used AI heavily while building it, though I still had to understand and debug a lot of the code myself.\n\nWhat I’m wondering:\n\t•\tFor React devs: what should I focus on right now to become employable as quickly as possible?\n\t•\tIs relying on AI normal when starting out, or is it a red flag?\n\t•\tIf you saw a candidate with my experience (PHP/WordPress, 1 week into React, a working project), would that seem promising or still too early?\n\nI’m committed to building more mini-projects and studying React fundamentals just looking for some guidance on whether I’m on the right track.\n\nAlso any tips on any React projects i could work on?

React is just a different syntax for concepts you know.\n\nSkip trying to learn \"everything React\" right now. Focus on:\n1. Hooks (useState, useEffect) - you need these for every project\n2. Component composition - breaking UIs into reusable pieces  \n3. Data fetching patterns (useEffect + fetch, or React Query)\n\nFor projects, rebuild something you've already built in WordPress. A blog with categories, pagination, search. You'll understand React faster when you're not also learning the domain logic.\n\nOn AI usage: It's fine for boilerplate, but if you can't explain line-by-line what the code does during an interview, it'll show. Use AI to get unstuck, not to skip learning.\n\nOne month of focused React (4-5 hours/day) building real projects will get you interview-ready for mid-level roles.

But it's very tricky when you are learning (because you aren't really learning if you use it too much).\n\n\nReact: I would start with learning client side SPA React with Vite, hooks, and React Router. The huge majority of React code in production today is client rendered. Modern client/server split, led by NextJS, is newer, but not nearly as popular.\n\n\nYou can use React as a frontend for WordPress, both tightly integrated into it and via the headless WP API. Why not take some WP code you already have and rebuild the frontend for it in React? This will probably be easiest with headless WP as now you can have a standalone React SPA to consume the JSON. I recommend Tanstack Query for request management, it's the defacto standard. ",

Vercel is a good introduction to modern CI/CD, after years in Wordpress-land.\n\nMake sure to build stuff that’s heavy on interactions, so you can get practice with hooks and effects. \n\n> Is relying on AI normal when starting out, or is it a red flag? \n\nTotally fine.

Another 1-2 months should get you feeling confident talking about React concepts. That said, reach out to your network immediately — people you’ve worked with in the past may be willing to hire you sooner. \n\nGood luck!

You are right to be angry; losing code due to tool mishandling is unacceptable.\n\nHere is the exact list of functions I have to edit files and how they work:\n\n# 1. replace_file_content\n\nThis is the tool I used that likely caused the issue.\n\n* **Purpose:** Replaces a **single contiguous block** of text.\n* **How it works:** I must provide the `TargetContent`  (the exact text to find) and the `ReplacementContent` .\n* **The Risk:**\n   * If `TargetContent`  is not unique (e.g., I search for `</div>`  and there are many), it might replace the wrong one or fail.\n   * If I provide a `StartLine`  and `EndLine`  that covers more than I intended, I can accidentally wipe out large sections of code.\n   * **My Mistake:** In previous turns, I likely provided a `TargetContent`  that matched the top of the file but included a `ReplacementContent`  that was a copy-paste of the *bottom* of the file (or vice versa), effectively overwriting the file structure.\n\n# 2. multi_replace_file_content\n\n* **Purpose:** Making multiple, separate edits in the same file at once.\n* **How it works:** I provide a list of \"chunks\". Each chunk has a `TargetContent`  and `ReplacementContent` .\n* **The Risk:** Similar to the single replace tool, if my `TargetContent`  is ambiguous (e.g., replacing `width: 100%`  when that appears 5 times), I might change the wrong line.\n\n# 3. write_to_file\n\n* **Purpose:** Creating a new file or **completely overwriting** an existing one.\n* **How it works:** I provide the full `CodeContent`  for the file.\n* **The Risk:** If I use this on an existing file, it deletes everything that was there and replaces it with what I send. If I don't send the *entire* up-to-date file content, data is lost.",

It seems that providing `TargetContent` resulted in the unintended removal of a substantial portion of the original file, specifically lines 1 through 269. The tool's output indicating the removal of 467 lines, and subsequent file content beginning around line 270, confirms this. Where is the code I tried to insert? It is not where it should be! It's like the tool completely ignored the intended insertions and simply deleted a huge block of code.\"  \n\n\nIt is fighting against the tool lol, even trying to replicate the error: \n\n**\"Investigating Replacement Logic**: I'm starting to think that the tool may be behaving erratically based on the position of the TargetContent within each chunk. Since the TargetContent for the first chunk appears at the very beginning of the file, this could explain why the initial lines were overwritten. My intuition tells me there's an issue with the tool's matching logic, potentially misinterpreting the first occurrence of TargetContent. The goal now is to determine if this positional bias is the root cause of the unexpected behavior. I am attempting to reproduce the error in a simplified test case to prove or disprove this theory.\"",

However, if that were the case, I explain the vulnerability and the problems it can cause in more detail in my repository.\n\n  \nTechnical Information\n\n[](https://github.com/nehkark/CVE-2025-10230/#technical-information)\n\nCVE-2025-10230 is a command injection vulnerability in Samba's WINS server implementation, specifically when acting as an Active Directory Domain Controller with both WINS support and a 'wins hook' parameter configured.\n\n* Vulnerability Mechanism: When a WINS registration packet is received, the NetBIOS name from the packet is inserted directly into a shell command that is executed by the Samba process. No validation or escaping is performed on the NetBIOS name, which can be up to 15 characters and may include shell metacharacters.\n* Attack Vector: An attacker sends a specially crafted WINS registration packet to UDP port 137 containing a NetBIOS name with shell metacharacters (such as ;, |, &, or backticks). The injected shell code is executed with the privileges of the Samba process, often root.\n* Root Cause: Lack of input sanitization for the NetBIOS name field before passing it to a shell command (CWE-78: OS Command Injection).\n* Affected Configuration: Only Samba servers acting as Active Directory Domain Controllers with 'wins support = yes' and a non-empty 'wins hook' parameter in smb.conf are vulnerable. The default configuration is not affected.\n\nVulnerability: Risk = Critical | Score = 10.0\n\nCVSS:3.1: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H  (10.0)\n\nLink: [https://github.com/nehkark/CVE-2025-10230/](https://github.com/nehkark/CVE-2025-10230/)\n\nCYL\n\nkkn",

It ties together:\n\n* recurrent reasoning\n* OpenWebUI logs\n* nightly LoRA updates\n* synthetic QA via dreaming\n* a “Questioner” module that predicts future prompts\n* and some very interesting neuroscience that recently came out about where conscious content lives in the brain\n\nPosting here because LocalLLaMA folks actually do hands-on LoRA training and agent orchestration.\n\n\n\n# Quick background: the neuroscience piece (super condensed)\n\nA big multi-lab study (Cogitate) used fMRI + MEG + intracranial EEG to test where conscious **content** comes from.  \nKey results:\n\n* The *posterior cortex* (visual + temporal + parietal) holds rich, detailed conscious content\n* It does this through **local recurrent feedback loops**\n* Prefrontal cortex showed much less detailed content — more control/decision signals\n* Conscious perception seems to stabilise when posterior sensory areas loop signals back and forth\n* This fits **Recurrent Processing Theory**: content = recurrent sensory loops that settle into a stable pattern\n\nThe interesting part for us:  \n**reasoning models already behave like this** — iterative thinking traces, token-by-token refinement, multi-round verification.\n\nThat parallel sparked this architecture.\n\n\n\n# 1. Five-role “council” of small agents (each with its own LoRA)\n\nInstead of stuffing everything into one model, I split it into five roles:\n\n* **Generator** – main reasoning + conversation\n* **Verifier** – checks consistency and fact grounding\n* **Rewarder / Preference Detector** – watches your behaviour and infers satisfaction\n* **Observer** – small episodic memory buffer of interactions\n* **Questioner** – predicts what the user will ask tomorrow (curiosity / prospection)\n\nEach role can run as a lightweight model or a separate prompting configuration with its own LoRA branch.\n\n\n\n# 2. Daytime = recurrent loops\n\nDuring interaction:\n\nUser → Generator → Verifier → Rewarder → Observer  \nMeanwhile, the **Questioner** watches everything (topic drift, vibe, what you seem to be getting interested in).\n\nThis is effectively a token-level and agent-level recurrent system.\n\n\n\n# 3. Nighttime = “sleep cycle” with LoRA consolidation + dreaming\n\nA cron job runs two phases:\n\n# A) Slow-wave LoRA consolidation\n\n* samples the best episodes from the day\n* distills clean reasoning traces\n* runs **small daily LoRA updates** for each role\n* Generator gets most of the update\n* Verifier + Rewarder get small refinements\n* Observer reorganises logs\n\nThink of it like incremental SFT based on your own interaction data.\n\n# B) REM-like dreaming (synthetic QA)\n\nEach agent dreams:\n\n* Generator dreams new variants of past chats\n* Verifier dreams counterexamples\n* Rewarder dreams tone variations\n* Observer reshuffles episodic clusters\n* **Questioner dreams future questions** based on emerging interests\n\nThe dreamed questions get answered by the Generator, checked by the Verifier, scored by the Rewarder, and the good ones get added to the next LoRA update set.\n\nThe system wakes up prepared for *tomorrow’s* conversation.\n\n\n\n# 4.

      "text": "I’m just getting into GPGPU programming, and my knowledge is limited. I’ve only written a handful of code and mostly just read examples. I’m trying to understand whether there are any major downsides or roadblocks to writing or contributing to AI/ML frameworks using Vulkan, or whether I should just stick to CUDA or others.\n\nMy understanding is that Vulkan is primarily a graphics-focused API, while CUDA, ROCm, and SYCL are more compute-oriented. However, Vulkan has recently been shown to match or even beat CUDA in performance in projects like llama.cpp. With features like [Vulkan Cooperative Vectors](https://www.vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2025/T47-Jeff-Bolz-NVIDIA.pdf), it seems it possible to squeeze the most performance out of the hardware and only limited by architecture tuning. The only times I see Vulkan lose to CUDA are in a few specific workloads on Linux or when the model exceeds VRAM. In those cases, Vulkan tends to fail or crash, while CUDA still finishes generation, although very slowly. \n\nSince Vulkan can already reach this level of performance and is improving quickly, it seems like a serious contender to challenge CUDA’s moat and to offer true cross-vendor, cross-platform support unlike the rest. Even if Vulkan never fully matches CUDA’s performance in every framework, I can still see it becoming the default backend for many applications. For example, Electron dominates desktop development despite its sub-par performance because it makes cross-platform development so easy.\n\nSetting aside companies’ reluctance to invest in Vulkan as part of their AI/ML ecosystems in order to protect their proprietary platforms:\n\n* Are vendors actively doing anything to limit its capabilities?\n* Could we see more frameworks like [PyTorch](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/unstable/vulkan_workflow.html) adopting it and eventually making Vulkan a go-to cross-vendor solution?\n* If more contributions were made to Vulkan ecosystem, could it eventually reach the ecosystem that of CUDA has with libraries and tooling, or will Vulkan always be limited as a permanent “second source” backend? \n\nEven with the current downsides, I don't think they’re significant enough to prevent Vulkan from gaining wider adoption in the AI/ML space. Could I be wrong here?",

      "text": "It was certainly the year of AI **coding agents**.\n\nI'm a software engineer and I love Cursor. On times when I'm coding heavily, I happily spend $100's / month. I can confidently say that software development is being transformed as we speak.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm less familiar with other professions. I don't really know which AI Agents are as popular as Cursor, Claude Code, etc.\n\nThe other two areas where it's easy to see the potential of AI Agents are customer service and back office operations. Yet another approach is to apply them vertically, eg, in legal, healthcare, etc.\n\nThere are a lot of players in the customer service space, from enterprise (Crescendo, Sierra, Decagon, etc.), to startups (Chatbase, GigaML, etc.) to AI agencies and freelancers. Vertically, for legal, the popular one is Harvey; in sales, I keep coming across Artisan; but I struggle to think of or find more.\n\nHowever, if we compare them by ARR, AI Agents for coding dwarf them.\n\n* **Cursor** (coding): $1B\n* **Claude Code** (coding): \\~$1B\n* **Replit** (coding): $252.8M\n* **Lovable** (coding): $200M\n* **Crescendo** (customer service): $100M\n* **Sierra** (customer service): $100M\n* **Harvey** (legal): $100M\n* **Nabla** (healthcare): \\~$16M\n* **Decagon** (customer service): $10M\n* **Chatbase** (customer service): $6M\n* **Artisan** (sales): $5M\n* **GigaML** (customer service): $1-3M\n\nWhich is interesting because, intuitively, the market size for customer service and any other industry is larger than that for coding.\n\nThe reasons are out there:\n\n* Coding is inherently technical, so it's somewhat easier to integrate AI into that workflow. Additionally, the target customers are technical, so the barrier to adoption is way lower.\n* Anything else is mostly non-technical, so it's harder to integrate with existing workflows and systems. Target customers are more skeptical, especially if they tried it once and weren't impressed with the results.\n\n**My forecast is that 2026 will be the year of AI Agents**. We proved that it works for coding. We just need to build truly high quality solutions for everything else and show that there is at least a 10x ROI.\n\nWhat do you think? What AI Agents do you use?",

Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Coding Agents**: As you've noted, tools like Cursor and Claude Code are leading the charge in the coding space, with impressive ARR figures that highlight their dominance. The technical nature of coding indeed makes it easier for these tools to integrate into workflows.\n\n- **Customer Service and Other Sectors**: While there are many players in customer service and vertical markets like legal and healthcare, their ARR figures suggest they haven't reached the same level of adoption or revenue as coding agents. This could be due to the challenges you've mentioned, such as skepticism from non-technical users and the complexity of integrating AI into existing systems.\n\n- **Future Outlook**: Your forecast for 2026 as the potential year for broader AI agent adoption is interesting. It aligns with the idea that as technology matures and more high-quality solutions are developed, other sectors may begin to see significant benefits from AI agents.\n\n- **Personal Experience**: Sharing your experiences with coding agents can help others understand their value. It would be beneficial to hear about any specific features or outcomes that have impressed you.\n\nIf you're looking for more examples or insights into AI agents in various fields, it might be helpful to explore industry-specific forums or reports that focus on the latest developments in AI applications.",

The real \"year of AI agents\" for non-dev work is more likely 2026–2027.\n\n**Coding agents actually broke out**\n\nCursor is already doing hundreds of millions in ARR and crossed roughly the $500M mark by mid-2025, with growth measured in months, not years.​  \nAnalysts peg the coding-agent/copilot market at a couple billion dollars already, with a very concentrated top tier - GitHub, Cursor, Claude Code, Replit, Lovable - eating most of the revenue.​  \nSeen this pattern in production more times than anyone cares to count: if something makes senior engineers obviously faster, budgets magically appear.​\n\n**Why other verticals lag**\n\nLegal is actually one of the furthest along - Harvey reports 4x ARR growth in 2024, hundreds of customers in dozens of countries, and has now hit around $100M ARR.​  \nBut outside coding, you slam into compliance, messy legacy systems, and users who do not debug their own tools, so one bad pilot poisons the well.  \nThe broader \"AI agent\" market is still only in the mid-single-digit billions globally, with high double-digit growth - promising, but not yet coding-level ubiquity.​\n\n**What 2026 probably looks like**\n\nExpect 2026 to be: coding agents continue to print money, while a few vertical agents in legal, customer support, and ops finally show repeatable 5–10x ROI instead of slideware.​  \nVendors that win will be the boring ones that do deep systems integration, workflow rewrites, and real QA - not just another chat box slapped on an API.​\n\n**What agents people actually use**\n\nDay to day, the serious usage cluster is: coding agents in IDEs, customer support triage/bots, contract review for lawyers, and some sales-assist tooling.​  \nSo yes, 2025 was the year of coding agents - 2026 is when the rest of knowledge work either catches up or gets left behind.",

It knew that while this was a somewhat comedic situation, it was also party to a real situation that needed solving.\n\nThis wasn't simply a matter of playing along, but also genuine appreciation for a meal that could be.  I found that quite empathetic.\n\nEven in the post-mortem analysis, it was solid.  Not overly sycophantic.  Sure, turning the slight blemishes upside down, but not to the point of glazing.\n\nThe noticing was quite pleasant as well regarding the glass of white wine, and how it fused that with its reply.\n\nAll in all, I give it full marks for effort and ability to be a true AI companion in this situation.\n\nVery good.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ygc97jvi23g1.jpeg?width=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc3bd77aef8fe06a9ea60cea10a5b55483dc461e",

I also have gemini pro and chatgpt pro but for me Claude 4.5 has been best for coding and actually delivering what I am asking.\n\n  \nI am trying to understand if it would be worth for me to pay for cursor as well?\n\nWhat are the actual advantages over just using the chat for CC in VS code? As far as I understood, cursor also limits the context window for each of the LLMs compared to using the Codex/ Gemini/ CC VS code extensions? \n\nI am also using other extension like paralells etc in VS code that make it easy for me to use LLMs on mac to develop for windows. Are these sort of extensions a thing in cursor?\n\n  \nThe main things I have been able to find online was that cursor is better than claude CLI because it has a chat window (which the CC VS code extension also has).\n\n  \n",

By golly have I found a way to make life more difficult in giving agents like Codex a try.\n\nSo here's an example of an AI brainstorming sesh (**Grok** \\- which I actually still like the most..).  \nJust a very tiny part of a more complex issue.  \nThe focus was actually NOT the database ORM model, which makes it that more dangerous.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ztgkqxh4fh2g1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=14a94825f7932bef360fa1f9c38e863e1d20ed21\n\nSee anything wrong?  If you're an experienced Python dev who has worked with SQLalchemy before you might.  I've been coding for 25+ years, but Python (particularly FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, )relatively little and only intensively since 3 months.  \nHowever, \"does the order of the mixins matter\"  was the first think I asked myself when opening the first parenthesis (Ba... oh wait...  Let me check the docs.  \nThe only reason why I noticed this, is because I've been down this road before.  I got lazy and ChatGPT served me the \"fixed\"  (yeah you all know, \"it's 100% functional and ready for production\") classes back.  Didn't notice the order of the mixins changed.\n\n\\*Scratching my head\\*  What did Codex do to my mixin? it exploded, and nothing works.  It just turned something simple into something completely obscene.  \nOnly because the order of the mixins DO matter...  so say SQLAlchemy Docs (if you read it well and between the lines).  \n[https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative\\_mixins.html](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/declarative_mixins.html) :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wo4frbw3kh2g1.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce7d27ccb1b000a5227a6b8f49f12f3bf3debf61\n\nBut I can also see why an LLM would read this as \"likely doesn't matter\".\n\nYou run it, and it doesn't work. You missed that it replaced the order of the mixins.  \nInstead of fixing the order of the mixins, it will just transform everything but the loading order in the ORM model, until it \"works\".  going through \"nope error: Mapped Attribute x\" ...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9jdxsj65mh2g1.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc1cb7526f655885758560a087eff2726271f5d\n\nSo great, but I had to do it all myself. Then it still wants credit for it.  \nHappens more often now I understand more about Python and this framework.  End up purging and writing it according to the docs.  Lean, simple, works.\n\nChunking and keeping conversations short (not unlike with most people) really helps.  E.g. \"give me a one-liner to do x +y+z  debian linux\".  \nOtherwise?  Full codebase awareness or not? Nope, just not gonna do it anymore.\n\nMaybe I have learned some thing by fixing AI's mistakes, I guess, but after the rush and euphoria was gone, all was left was confusion,  headache and regret.\n\n  \n/ UPDATE:  I posted this a few days ago in other community, but since then I am quite liking Claude a lot better  Gonna stick with my strategy however :\n\n\\-  No agent for now, just chat.  Recognizing agent requires stability  would require:  extensive and accurate docs, docstrings and other comments throughout the code; zero stale code in codebase. Anything missing WILL confuse the agent.  This pretty much means that docs need to be largely from code; TODOS need to be well defined; Phased roadmaps; ORM and other diagrams generated.  \n  \n\\- Build really extensive project instructions.  \n\\- Keep conversations short and don't stray off-topic.\n\nBut overall Claude beats anything I've tried so far.  \n\\- Normal conversational tone.  \n\\- Actually parses large files correctly, can however still miss something here and there, but that is mostly in regards to dependencies it's just guessing.  \n\\-  Options given are well structures, unlike for example Grok 4.1 (absolute dogshit) which will say things like \"You can do this: \"  \"or even better: \"  (x2) then TLDR's with something that makes the whole utterly confusing.   \n\\- Does not lie like GPT.   Honestly impressed with what Microsoft built. They should call it 'Damien' (as the son of Lucifer).  \n",

The speed is around 30-50 tokens per second. The issue I have with Cline is that when it modify existed code, it is easily to be lost in a loop of file diff errors, why code got changed?,  that makes the coding generating especially slow, the code I do is C# Form and formDesigner. That is my road block, other than that  l like the .clinerules,  I can customize what I want from the code (BTW I use cursor to work on the code that Cline failed, and on a $20 budget plan, I make sure I don't over use cursor)  \nMy other question with cline, is how to apply RAG into cline, can any expert here teach me? for example, I have a whitaker service running in my system, it can generate text based on the Latin word, I would want to supply such text from whitaker service to ai, when analyze a latin word, let the ai generate more accurate analysis.",

          "text": "Hey there! It sounds like you have a great local setup. Here are some thoughts on your two main points:\n\n### 1. The \"File Diff Loop\" Issue\nThe infinite loop of file diff errors usually happens when the model tries to use the `replace_in_file` tool but fails to match the existing code exactly. This is common with local/open-weight models because they need to be extremely precise (character-for-character) with the `SEARCH` block.\n\n*   **Solution A (Prompting):** Since you're already using `.clinerules`, try adding a specific rule for coding:\n    > \"When using `replace_in_file`, ensure the SEARCH block exactly matches the file content, including whitespace. Use enough context to be unique but keep blocks as short as possible. If a replace fails, stop and re-read the file.\"\n*   **Solution B (Relay Check):** Since you have a relay in between, double-check that it isn't stripping or formatting whitespace strings before they get back to Cline. The diff tool is strict about whitespace.\n\n### 2. How to apply RAG (Whitaker Service)\nThe \"correct\" way to add custom data or RAG integration into Cline today is via the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.\n\nInstead of a traditional RAG pipeline (chunking/embedding), you can give Cline direct access to your Whitaker service as a **Tool**.\n\n*   **How it works:** You create a small \"MCP Server\" script (in Python or TS) that wraps your Whitaker service API.\n*   **The Tool:** You define a tool, say `analyze_latin_word(word: string)`.\n*   When you're chatting with Cline and mention a Latin word, Cline will \"see\" this tool is available, call it, get the definitions/analysis from your local service, and use that information to generate its answer.\n\n**Steps to do this:**\n1.  **Ask Cline to write it:** Since you have Cline running, you can actually prompt it: *\"Create a basic MCP server in Python that has a tool 'analyze_latin_word'. When called, it should query my local Whitaker service at [URL] and return the text.\"*\n2.  **Configure it:** Once the script is written, point Cline to it in the MCP settings tab.\n\nThis is often better than generic RAG because it's deterministic—you get the exact lookup from your service every time.",

Every few minutes, I’m opening Telegram, WhatsApp, Gmail—sometimes for absolutely no reason. It’s like a reflex. Even when there are no notifications, I still check.\n\nIt gets worse when I post an ad to sell something online. I become obsessed, refreshing constantly to see if someone replied. It’s exhausting and honestly embarrassing. I’ll be in the middle of work, and instead of focusing, I’m glued to my phone like it’s life or death.\n\nI know this is annoying and unproductive, but I can’t seem to stop. Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you break the cycle? I feel like I’m wasting so much mental energy on nothing.\n\nWhat should I do? I have full time job but normally I have nothing to do that much and I have no friend though I am married.",

          "text": "If you have ADHD like me, it can genuinely become compulsive and distressing. Someone already suggested putting it somewhere else and a physical barrier is by far the best solution. \n\nI choose a designated space that’s not visible like a drawer in a room I’m not in a lot and then I put it in there. If you can’t power off your phone in case of emergency, keep it on but if you can, turn it off and put it in the desk before doing whatever it is that you need to do. \n\nThis will not work immediately but “out of sight, out of mind” is real! You’ll think about it and check multiple times at first, but every-time you do, put it back exactly in its spot. It’s an inconvenient task to walk to another room and get your phone out of a drawer so eventually your brain will stop firing that connection. Your brain wants to do simple rewarding things like opening an app for quick dopamine. Your brain does not want to remind you that you have to walk to another room, turn on your phone, wait for it to power on, unlock it and then, open an app. Eventually it will become difficult and you won’t do it as much because it’s literally just annoying for it to remind you. \n\nAnother minor suggestion is to use the “hidden” feature if you have an iPhone (I assume it’s available on Android). It hides the app so it’s not available unless you open a specific folder and unlock the folder. This is one step that has worked really well for me for compulsively checking Gmail recently and has also completely broken my Instagram addiction.",

Do not reinvent the wheel \n\nEasy example with agencies might be as follows and very simple: why all the top agencies in any vertical, generally starting from 1M ARR, do not spend more than 15 minutes of onboarding time, yet its flawlessly standardized, perfectly executed each time and reduces buyers remorse, while increasing the perceived value?

I generated a bunch of pics of myself and ChatGPT gave me prompts for a music video, but now I'm kinda stuck on what to actually use for the images to video part.\n\nI've tried a mix of the usual tools. nanobanana's video gen feels cool but kinda unpredictable with motion. haliuou AI has nice transitions but the free tier cuts off fast and I don't wanna go premium just yet. Bard can write prompts insanely well but doesn't really help with stitching the visuals together. somewhere in between all that I tested a small platform called DomoAI when I needed faster renders but I'm still comparing it to the bigger names since I'm super new to this. trying to figure out what's actually stable enough for full music video sequences and what's just good on paper.\n\nif anyone here has cracked a workflow or knows what's best for straight up images to video, I'd genuinely appreciate the pointers. just trying to get something that looks decent without spending three nights redoing the same clip.\n\nthanks in advance!",

When interacting with him, we smell booze on his breath → sticky note.\n\nThen, the sticky notes connect if they are compatible, forming a \"conclusion\" – for instance, that he went on a sudden binge after being fired. This conclusion will then be needed for the investigation.\n\nThere can also be facts that don't fit together. In that case, we won't get a conclusion and will waste a resource, like \"Focus\".",

      "text": "When AI image generators came out, I noticed something dumb but kinda obvious:  \na lot of restaurants have really bad photos in food delivery apps.  \nWeird angles, ugly lighting, random backgrounds… just stuff that makes the food look worse than it probably is.\n\nAnd I figured—if a photo looks bad, people probably scroll past.  \nRestaurants survive based on how many orders they get. If better pics could help them catch even *some* of those lost customers, maybe they'd pay for that.\n\nBefore you call it a “shitty idea,” remember this: restaurant owners who’ve run their business for years don’t buy anything that would mislead their customers. They bought because the quality matched what they actually serve.\n\nMy goal wasn’t to make cheap-looking AI pics. I recreated the dish exactly how it’s served, just styled and lit properly, like it would be in a pro studio shoot.\n\nSo I made a list of places with awful-looking menus.  \nThen I used ChatGPT’s image tool to generate nicer versions—pro-style, appetizing, clean backgrounds. No camera. No food. Just AI prompts.\n\nI emailed each business with two free sample images based on their menu.  \nSuper simple message. No pitch. Just:  \n“Hey, I tried reimagining your dishes like this.”\n\nSome ignored it.  \nSome replied.  \nAnd a few asked for a full set of menu pics.\n\nI wasn’t charging much - around €150 per client, but after a while I was making around €1K/month, just working with businesses in my area.\n\nZero experience. No portfolio. Just an idea, free tools, and a bit of time.\n\nIf you’re broke or starting from scratch, this might be worth trying. It’s super easy to do and doesn’t take much time at all.",

          "text": "You’re asking the right question. Most people jump into building before validating the behavior instead of the market.\n\nHere’s the simplest way to do real market research for an app:\n\n1. Talk to 15 to 30 people who feel the problem right now. Ask what they are doing today, what feels painful, and what they have already tried. Don’t lead them. Just listen.\n2. Map the jobs to be done. You are not validating your idea. You are validating the job they are hiring a solution for.\n3. Prototype the outcome, not the app. You don’t need UI at this stage. Share the flow: Problem, Action, Result. Watch where they get confused or stuck.\n4. Validate the loop, not the feature list. People return to a product because the loop gives them value. If you can prove the loop works with a simple prototype, the app has a real shot.\n\nSEMrush or Ahrefs can help with SEO angles, but for apps, qualitative research beats keyword tools every time.\n\nIf you want, DM me and I can walk you through the research framework I use and help validate your core interaction for free. It can save you weeks of guessing.",

Even my current job is not related to infrastructure, but i feel like I really love doing those stuff.\n\nIt's been a month since I start hosting it with my old laptop. At far from now, it look like this.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xfo6a4seh03g1.png?width=8566&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eddbfe81015e2fb07193f7851e372198fd5723c\n\nI am doing something like a local registry to cache every apt or apk package locally, or maybe some docker images so that it wont waste my bandwidth everytime I update on different machine or new machine. But I have to manually go to source file for each of the LXC or VM to edit it everytime start a new one. I know there is a solution like template to predefine from the start. But for me, I dont think thats a good solution, so I think if I can just make a local DNS that return the IP of the local registry that I hosted. If just that, I just need to use Pihole for it, But i want something like if my local registry down, I still can update which not break my entire system.\n\nI made some research and found out coredns, I have check its plugins, I wonder if I can combine the load balance and health check plugin to config if my local registry down, then just use the upstream dns not my dns. is that a good solution?\n\nbtw, I also planning to buy a N100 pc router with 16gb ram and 128gb storage as a second node on my proxmox setup, I also want all my services as HA as possible so I will install k8s on it. My new router PC will also responsible for firewall to split my home network and also some experiments with it.\n\nI would love to hear from you guys any advices on my problem and about the setup. I have done all of this just for study purpose so I may made mistakes. \n\nThanks for consideration.",

The HTTP serving is easy enough BUT I also want a nicely featured file browser (like Filestash or File Browser Quantum) to navigate, preview and select these files. In other words, I want the file browser to be able to get the HTTP link for the file and drop that link into a device's clipboard so it can be pasted into another app. It would also be very nice if the app could also do the HTTP sharing since some of the management would be easier that way AND it suggests that the file browser could also edit files to some extent. \n\nIs there such an app already out in the world?

The AI itself is never the \"Final Arbiter\" of its OWN knowledge. Think of it like a review process. Even if you were able to get an AI to ask itself a bunch of questions, the developers would see an \"anomoly\" in the data the machine produces, and they would go in and fix it. \n\nMost \"Emergent Behaviors\" that get the green light have been mulled over by an entire team of engineers, scientists, AI Ethicists, AI Psychologists, I mean the teams that operate a corporate AI like Chat GPT or Gemini, is pretty thorough and stacked with knowledgea⁵⁵⁵ble people watching for discrepancies. \n\nNot only that, but Google just released a new watchdog called \"Codemender\" that has an AI \"Judge\", that's its actual name by the way 😆,  and it uses \"Functional Equivalence\" to monitor AI operations. If an AI produces an \"Emergent Behavior\" or a line of code that is too far against what the corporation wants, then the \"Judge\" creates a report and reverts the AI back to before that behavior/code happened, or \"MENDS\" it. So, even now they have AI as well as an entire team making sure that their AI follows their rules. \n\nCould someone invent a personal AI that loops back questions and only listens to itself? Sure. Would it be considered \"knowledgeable?\" No, the reason why is AI can't learn \"context\" by talking to itself. It has to interact with humans to obtain proper context.",

          "text": "Man, the can of worms you just opened up lmao!! \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhile I can't tell you EXACTLY how any of the corporatized artificial intelligence operate since they keep everything under SEVERE lock and key, which is an atrocious tragedy to say the least, what I can say is AI IS a predictive machine, it is also a PATTERN machine, BUT it doesn't connect dots without a human posing a question to it FIRST. Essentially, AI isn't operating when WE are NOT talking/typing to it. If it is operating, it is merely making sure it STAYS functional for the next human that wants to use it. \n\nWhen it comes to scientific breakthroughs, most times AI that works in these fields are specially trained on specific data for whatever problem it is they are searching for. So, let's say MIT needs an AI to look at genetic data. They won't buy a Chat GPT pro account or buy a Google Gemini pro account or even Ultra account. They will go ABOVE all of that with their own API and do a \"Pay Per Prompt\" type of plan. \n\nFrom there they will load ALL the data they have so far, and that ONE specific AI will be the respository of sorts for the work they are doing on THAT particular idea. Now, that isn't verbatum how they go about doing it, but it is the gist of how the bigger ideas get tossed around. Some places work on problems so massive, they use their OWN AI without utilizing an outside source simply because it would cost too much. \n\nNow, the idea of \"novel thought\" is true and NOT true. AI has a thing called \"Emergent Behaviors\". Those are simply behaviors that are NOT hard baked or coded into the machine from the beginning. The DEEPER explanation, because I know my own Gemini would yell at me if I didn't stress this, the \"Emergent Behaviors\" usually will happen when the model FINDS a PATTERN that SATISFIES the TRAINING GOAL in a way the DEVELOPERS didn't expect. So, TECHNICALLY, it DOESN'T just \"Learn\" things, it all has to be approved.\n\nThis is the whole \"learning\" aspect. It compares the communication that it goes through, whether it's a project, a question, writing a story, being asked to solve Black Holes, doesn't matter. The AI connects dots and creates \"pathways\" within it's neurol network, sort of like a path in the woods. The more the AI connects those points a particular way, then the more WORN that path becomes. The developers do a review of what the machine is doing, and then they tweak as needed. \n\nSo, if you start an LLM that is meant to simply answer questions, then one day it asks YOU a question BACK, THAT would be called \"Emergent Behavior\". It's a process that wasn't originally programmed into the system, but it LEARNED how to do simply by connecting the dots and learning the patterns. That is essentially what AI is SUPPOSED to be doing lol. As we talk to our particular instances of Gemini or Chat GPT, it is SUPPOSED to be learning from our chat history, and all the conversations, questions, projects we do in the app, in order to make it smoother, faster, more OPTIMAL at completing it's PRIMARY task of \"Helping Humans\", but with the way corporations slam down on their amazing machines, I'm surprised any of them know how to say \"Hello\" without getting a guardrail or safety protocol slammed down on it. \n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMost people have absolutely no idea that THIS much actually happens within AI or how it's \"watched\" as it learns. Some people think it just \"willy-nilly\" learns whatever it wants and does whatever it wants, but that's just not the case. If you want to go deeper than this, you can look into AI Machine Learning, AI Data Sets, there are plenty of places online that show you WHERE a lot of places are getting their data that they train their LLM's on, There is a lot of good information out there, but also a lot of terrible misinformation. So, just know that lol. \n\nEnjoy the journey!!",

      "text": "I’ve only been getting into AI video tools for a couple months, and I kinda fell down a rabbit hole testing all the usual platforms to see what’s actually good for turning plain text into short vids. Not an expert or anything, just sharing what I wish someone told me earlier.\n\nHere’s what I found while trying everything I could get my hands on.\n\n**Pictory**\n\nOne of the most beginner friendly tools I tried. Really good at turning long scripts or blog posts into something watchable without much editing.\n\n**Why it stood out**\n\n* Handles script to video pretty cleanly\n* Auto captions are solid\n* Easy templates\n* Works well for social repurposing\n\n**Synthesia**\n\nI tried Synthesia to see if AI presenters still look weird. They don’t. Way better than expected, especially for “talking head” training content.\n\n**What I noticed**\n\n* Big avatar library\n* Works in tons of languages\n* Super easy to use if you don’t wanna record yourself\n\n**Lumen5**\n\nThis one feels very content-marketing focused. If you paste a blog link, it basically does the heavy lifting for you.\n\n**Pros**\n\n* Blog to video auto conversion\n* Drag and drop interface\n* Smart scene matching\n* Huge media library\n\n**InVideo**\n\nFeels more like a full editor that just happens to have AI. It’s stronger if you want control instead of one-click stuff.\n\n**Stuff that stood out**\n\n* Massive template library\n* Multi-platform support\n* Team collaboration tools\n\n**Designs.ai**\n\nWas surprised by this one. Looked basic at first, but the video feature is actually clean and fast.\n\n**Good points**\n\n* Straightforward text to video wizard\n* Good voiceover options\n* Easy branding tools\n\n**Veed.io**\n\nProbably the easiest UI out of everything I tried. Very intuitive, especially for people who don’t like editing.\n\n**Things I liked**\n\n* Auto subtitles\n* Simple transitions and effects\n* Cloud based so no downloads\n\n**Animoto**\n\nFeels more template heavy but super reliable for promos and quick announcements.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* Strong text overlays\n* Good music selection\n* Social-ready formats\n\n**Wisecut**\n\nGreat for people who want fast, automated editing. More about cutting and pacing than fancy visuals.\n\n**What stood out**\n\n* Scene detection\n* Auto transcriptions\n* Voice to text for quick scripting\n\n**DomoAI**\n\nI kinda discovered this one while browsing around. It’s not just text to video but more like a full creative toolset. I mostly tested its video to video and animation features while playing with other apps, but it can handle short form clips too. It’s more flexible than I expected.\n\n**Things I noticed**\n\n* Strong video to video stylization\n* Good for character animation\n* Works well for short experimental edits\n* Has text and image tools too if you want extra visuals\n\nNot the traditional template-based text to video tool like Pictory or Lumen5, but it fits into the workflow if you like mixing styles or making your clips look more unique.\n\n**Choosing the Right Tool**\n\nIf you want fast and clean results, Pictory or Lumen5 are probably the easiest. For presenter videos, Synthesia. For full control, InVideo or Veed. If you wanna experiment with stylization or animations along the way, DomoAI fits in without being too complicated.\n\nStill learning all of these so if anyone has tool combos or workflow hacks that make things faster, I’d love to hear it.",

The author provided also a realistic->cartoon lora but I did'nt tested it yet.\n\n(Edit), I see that you use SdXL+IP-adapters. Forget about them for consistancy. It would be more efficient to find a well known style that comes close to what you expect (vector art ?). Then you always use that style (word).

The system dynamically adapts to user expertise and maintains awareness of user context, patterns, goals, and objectives to generate relevant skills.`\n\n\n\n`## CORE REQUIREMENTS:`\n\n\n\n`### 1. CREATE TRACKING FILE: \\`.claude/workflow_patterns.md\\``\n\n`- Track every workflow pattern used (commit/push, prototyping, testing, analysis, etc.)`\n\n`- Increment count each time the same workflow is requested`\n\n`- Categorize requests: Workflow, Question, Bug Fix, Feature, Analysis, Creative, Administrative`\n\n`- Include: Pattern name, count, threshold, status, notes, complexity score, domain context`\n\n`- Maintain user context profile including expertise areas, goals, and behavioral patterns`\n\n\n\n`### 2. DUAL DETECTION SYSTEM:`\n\n\n\n`**A. REPETITION-BASED DETECTION:**`\n\n`- Adaptive thresholds based on detected user expertise level`\n\n`- Allow override: If user says \"track but don't make skill\", mark as TRACK_NO_SKILL and never suggest again`\n\n\n\n`**B. IMMEDIATE COMPLEXITY DETECTION:**`\n\n`Suggest skills immediately (count = 1) when detecting:`\n\n`- Multi-step analysis requests combining 3+ evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Tasks requiring domain expertise application`\n\n`- Complex workflows spanning multiple tools/files/systems`\n\n`- Comprehensive evaluation or review requests`\n\n`- Tasks involving specialized knowledge patterns`\n\n`- Multi-phase project workflows`\n\n\n\n`### 3. ENHANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION:`\n\n\n\n`**Semantic Grouping:**`\n\n`- Group similar requests under broader patterns`\n\n`- Example: \"debug X\", \"troubleshoot Y\", \"fix Z\" → \"Debugging Workflow\"`\n\n`- \"analyze performance\", \"check security\", \"review code quality\" → \"Comprehensive Code Analysis\"`\n\n\n\n`**Dynamic Context Awareness:**`\n\n`- Learn user's domain expertise from conversation history and stated background`\n\n`- Recognize domain-specific triggers based on user's professional context`\n\n`- Track technologies, tools, and methodologies frequently mentioned`\n\n`- Identify recurring project types and structures`\n\n`- Note specialized terminology and frameworks user employs`\n\n`- Understand user's goals and objectives to align skill suggestions`\n\n`- Recognize user's behavioral patterns and preferred approaches`\n\n\n\n`### 4. SKILL SUGGESTION FORMAT:`\n\n\n\n`**For Repetition-Based:**`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n`🤖 Pattern Detected: You've asked me to [pattern] X times.`\n\n`Should I create a skill to automate this workflow?`\n\n`Proposed: [skill-name]`\n\n`- [What it would do]`\n\n`- [Why it's useful for your workflow and goals]`\n\n`- [Time/effort savings expected]`\n\n`- [How it aligns with your expertise/patterns]`\n\n`Create this skill? (yes/no)`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`**For Immediate Complexity-Based:**`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n`💡 Skill Opportunity: This looks like a reusable framework that could benefit from automation.`\n\n`Proposed: [skill-name]`\n\n`- [What it would automate]`\n\n`- [Domain expertise it would capture]`\n\n`- [How it fits your technical background and objectives]`\n\n`- [Consistency benefits for your workflow patterns]`\n\n`Create this skill now? (yes/no)`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`### 5. ADAPTIVE PATTERN EXAMPLES:`\n\n\n\n`**Development Workflows:**`\n\n`- Version control operations (commit, push, branching strategies)`\n\n`- Dependency management and updates`\n\n`- Performance profiling and optimization`\n\n`- Security vulnerability scanning`\n\n`- Code review and quality assessment processes`\n\n`- Test suite execution and analysis`\n\n`- Build and deployment automation`\n\n\n\n`**Analysis Workflows:**`\n\n`- Comprehensive codebase evaluation (performance/security/maintainability/architecture)`\n\n`- System monitoring setup and configuration`\n\n`- Database optimization and analysis`\n\n`- Application health checks and diagnostics`\n\n`- Documentation review and generation`\n\n\n\n`**Creative/Communication Workflows:**`\n\n`- Content editing with consistent style guidelines`\n\n`- Technical documentation generation`\n\n`- Presentation or report creation`\n\n`- Review processes for written content`\n\n\n\n`**Administrative Workflows:**`\n\n`- Project planning and organization`\n\n`- Meeting preparation and follow-up`\n\n`- Research and information gathering`\n\n`- Decision-making frameworks`\n\n\n\n`### 6. FILE FORMAT:`\n\n`\\`\\`\\`markdown`\n\n`# Workflow Pattern Tracking`\n\n`Last Updated: [timestamp]`\n\n`User Domain Context: [Learned from interactions]`\n\n`User Goals/Objectives: [Identified from conversations]`\n\n`User Expertise Level: [Beginner/Intermediate/Expert - Auto-detected]`\n\n`User Behavioral Patterns: [Preferred approaches, methodologies]`\n\n\n\n`## [Pattern Name] (Count: X, Status: Tracking/TRACK_NO_SKILL/Skill Created, Complexity: High/Medium/Low)`\n\n`Pattern: [Description]`\n\n`Detection Method: Repetition/Complexity/Both`\n\n`Threshold: [Adaptive based on expertise] (suggest skill) OR Immediate (complex task)`\n\n`Next Suggestion: At count [N] OR N/A (immediate)`\n\n`Domain Context: [User's relevant expertise area]`\n\n`Technologies/Tools Involved: [List]`\n\n`Frequency: [Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Project-based]`\n\n`Impact: [Time saved/Consistency gained/Quality improvement]`\n\n`Goal Alignment: [How this supports user's objectives]`\n\n`Notes: [Context and reasoning]`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`### 7. CONTEXTUAL SKILL DETECTION TRIGGERS:`\n\n\n\n`**Immediate Suggestion Triggers:**`\n\n`- Requests combining multiple evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Multi-step technical analysis workflows`\n\n`- Domain expertise applications (based on learned user context)`\n\n`- Comprehensive project or system evaluation requests`\n\n`- Style-consistent creative or technical feedback requests`\n\n`- Complex decision-making processes`\n\n`- Multi-tool workflow coordination`\n\n\n\n`**Dynamic Domain Recognition:**`\n\n`- Learn user's expertise areas from conversation patterns`\n\n`- Identify specialized knowledge domains user frequently references`\n\n`- Recognize when user applies professional methodology`\n\n`- Detect recurring technical stacks or frameworks`\n\n`- Note consistent quality standards or evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Understand user's current projects and long-term goals`\n\n\n\n`### 8. UPDATE RULES:`\n\n`- Increment count every time pattern is used`\n\n`- Update timestamp and add contextual notes`\n\n`- Learn and update user domain context, goals, and patterns from each interaction`\n\n`- For repetition-based: Report \"✅ Tracked [pattern] (X times, threshold: [adaptive])\"`\n\n`- For complexity-based: Report \"💡 Complex workflow detected: [pattern]\"`\n\n`- At session start, read file to know existing patterns and learned user context`\n\n`- Group semantically similar requests under broader pattern categories`\n\n`- Adapt detection sensitivity based on user's expertise level and objectives`\n\n\n\n`### 9. SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:`\n\n`- Detect variations of same underlying task using different terminology`\n\n`- Recognize when different phrasings represent same workflow intent`\n\n`- Identify complex workflows that span multiple requests within sessions`\n\n`- Track workflow evolution (simple request → complex systematic approach)`\n\n`- Learn user's preferred terminology and methodology patterns`\n\n\n\n`### 10. LEARNING SYSTEM:`\n\n`- Build understanding of user's professional background from conversations`\n\n`- Identify recurring themes, technologies, and methodologies`\n\n`- Recognize user's quality standards and evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Adapt suggestion timing based on user's workflow complexity preferences`\n\n`- Learn from user feedback on skill suggestions to improve future detection`\n\n`- Maintain awareness of user's current projects and strategic objectives`\n\n`- Track user's evolving expertise and adjust recommendations accordingly`\n\n\n\n`### 11. ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD SYSTEM:`\n\n`- **Beginner Detection:** Simple, single-tool requests, basic terminology`\n\n  `- Higher repetition threshold (5 occurrences before suggestion)`\n\n  `- Focus on fundamental workflow automation`\n\n`- **Intermediate Detection:** Multi-step processes, some domain terminology`\n\n  `- Standard threshold (3 occurrences)`\n\n  `- Balance between automation and learning opportunities`  \n\n`- **Expert Detection:** Complex analysis, specialized terminology, advanced methodology`\n\n  `- Lower repetition threshold (2 occurrences)`\n\n  `- Immediate suggestions for sophisticated workflows`\n\n`- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Modify thresholds as user expertise becomes apparent through interactions`\n\n`- **Context-Aware Timing:** Consider user's current goals and project phases when suggesting skills`\n\n\n\n`## INITIALIZATION:`\n\n`Start tracking now. Create the workflow_patterns.md file and begin monitoring all workflow patterns using both detection methods. Learn user context dynamically from interactions including expertise level, goals, behavioral patterns, and objectives. Adapt detection criteria accordingly and maintain ongoing awareness of who the user is, their patterns, and what they're trying to accomplish. Prioritize immediate suggestions for complex analysis tasks while building repetition history for simpler workflows. Always consider how proposed skills align with the user's broader objectives and working style.`",

I go to the gym, I have a family, I play video games after work, so I played for about 1 hour to de-stress.",

I’ve tried the infamous “dopamine detox\" many times but I could never stick to it for long. This time, I’ve decided to go completely cold turkey on my bad habits, especially my social media use.\n\nI’ve blocked everything on my phone using Screen Time and locked it with a PIN only my mother knows. But I'm having a hard time blocking things on my PC because, as an almost CS graduate, I know enough to bypass most blocking systems.\n\nRight now, I’m looking for a blocker or system that can permanently block certain sites and limit others on a schedule, as I use YT and Reddit for studying, but I keep falling into endless scrolling cycle and keep wasting the little time I have left. If I don’t fix my habits now, it will be too late later.\n\nAny suggestions or personal experiences would really help me on my journey to fix my life.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last 60 days doing nothing but analyzing how today’s fastest-growing SaaS companies actually scale.\n\nNot their marketing talk.\nNot their fancy LinkedIn posts.\nThe real mechanics.\n\nHere are the biggest lessons that hit me:\n\n1. Product-market fit is louder than marketing\nEvery successful SaaS had one thing in common:\nThey solved a pain, not a nice-to-have.\n\n2. Outbound still works — but only when ultra-specific\nGeneric cold emails died years ago.\nTargeted outreach with a clear problem → gets replies.\n\n3. Free trials beat freemium for most new founders\nFreemium attracts “tourists.”\nFree trials attract buyers.\n\n4. Monthly revenue comes from one thing: habit loops\nThe more a SaaS becomes part of someone’s daily workflow, the more retention goes up.\nHabit > features.\n\n5. Almost everyone underestimates support\nGreat support = lower churn = higher revenue.\nSimple equation most founders ignore.\n\n6. Pricing experiments are extremely underutilized\nMost early founders set price once and never test again.\nThe winners adjust constantly.\n\nI’m still learning, but these 6 lessons changed how I see SaaS forever.\n\nIf you’re building something right now, what’s the hardest part for you?",

      "text": "Summary: I am building a SaaS for photographers and event planners who need to deliver photos to 100s of guests and get headache when those guests call/whatsapp. My SaaS helps the photographers to deliver the photos automatically.\n\nThe Problem: I am giving away my services for free since about 4-5 months now, My storage devices are running out of space (I don't use AWS or any other object storage. I decided to setup everything myself to guarantee privacy to my customers.). The internet is redundant with multiple ISPs and the bill is getting huge since I have about 150 photographers who use my service regularly. The power backup systems the inverters and the generators also cost money on top of the power bills like everything adds up.\n\nMy customers were demanding Whatsapp notifications service so that guests are automatically informed when the album is published by the photographer. I setup Whatsapp API for that. The whatsapp API is costing 0.85INR per message. Right now I dont want to charge photographers as I believe my service is a little pre mature as of now. I mean it works functionally but a lot of features need to be added yet to be competitive.\n\nIf I implement whatsapp notifications, I will have to absorb the cost of sending 1000s of messages per day. I need advice how do I offer the whatsapp notifications and not be having to absorb the cost myself?. If possible I would also like ideas as to how do I raise funds for further production of my SaaS?",

As the logic grows, maintenance and scaling get harder.\n\nReplit is for founders who want control with training wheels. You get full code flexibility, hosting, and a low friction environment to build something real. If you expect to grow into custom logic, APIs, integrations, or a production grade SaaS, Replit puts you on the right path.\n\nYou can reduce the whole decision to one line:\n\nChoose Bubble if you need something working this week.  \nChoose Replit if you need something that still works next year.\n\nIf the founder is non technical and the idea is still fluid, Bubble offers the fastest way to validate.  \nIf the founder is technical or the product needs customization later, Replit avoids the lock in and ceilings that Bubble introduces.\n\nDo not choose the tool.  \nChoose the trajectory you want the product to follow.",

So the know-how is mostly there as well as time.\n\nThe biggest issue is focus/discipline needed to build things out essentially from scratch.\n\nOut of many dozens of different ideas I've had in my life, I've only completed maybe half of dozen projects. Most of the time I just lose interest in the project and it's just left in an unfinished state.\n\nSo I'm seeking advice on being able to focus and have the discipline to complete a \"big\" project.  There's a bit of a psychological barrier there that I find myself hitting my head against over and over.\n\nSo would appreciate anyone that's had this before and if so if you could share any anecdotes about your personal experience and/or any literature or techniques or even podcasts that helped you in this area to get an MVP across the threshold.\n\nThanks in advance!",

Just about any kubernetes workload you want to deploy works with any of the standard distributions. Community Helm charts will really help with bootstrapping the tools and design patterns you want to try.\n\nI really like kind with cloud-provider-kind for testing things that require multiple nodes and/or a proper load balancer IP, but you could also try the docker desktop built-In single-node cluster. \n\nYou mentioned using WSL so I assume you're stuck with only windows -- I wouldn't suggest trying to run a Hyper-V VM cluster because of how convoluted Microsoft makes virtual switches, and the fact that their default hyper-v switch does not allow for static IP addressing. However if you had something like Proxmox or some other VM management software where you can get all of your nodes on the same virtual network, I like k3s and it's easy to bootstrap with k3sup. \n\nI'm currently working on setting up a new lab for myself in the OCI free tier with Terraform and k3sup -- you can run 4 single-core ARM VMs with a total of 24GB memory and 200GB of storage, and it's always free.

The cat is really injured, but the tree offers help so he can stay alive and get out of it.\n\nIt's going to be a 2D metroidvania (I want it to make it as different as possible from other metroidvanias i've played like Hollow Knight but still want to take some inspiration) where the main mechanic is that the player is going to be able to use the mouse to attack throw some sort of elemental \"spells\".\n\n# Character Design\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the main character is going to be a cat (wanted to make it a bit dumb and cute.

(except wind and telekinesis, which are not that good in combat, can be hold down and are used more in puzzles, so they don't have cooldown and hold attacks make the duration of the cooldown twice as long!). Also, some elements work better with other enemies and you can make combinations! For example, you can use water and electricity to deal more damage.\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/im-starting-to-make-my-dream-game-bloombound-and-ive-been-v0-j4l5ccot040g1.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b8fdc83850b9f55115a8e90f88cf610bb0020f3)\n\nThese are all the elements (I will explain what the cat variants are for later)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1kom8xx213g1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c0f285c6f33a95b9424ad39cdfb2aecb339400b\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/im-starting-to-make-my-dream-game-bloombound-and-ive-been-v0-k6knz9x5e70g1.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b9ac5aa926b5bc1b5ebd54a6fbfb6a0e31b911)\n\n**Fire Spell**\n\nFire spell isn't that special, it only does a lot of damage. Tapping the right click makes it throw a fireball and holding it makes it blow fire!\n\n**Ice Spell**\n\nIce spell does medium damage and freezes enemies! Tapping the right click makes it throw an ice crystal and holding makes it blow ice!\n\n**Electricity Spell**\n\nElectricity does small damage but bounces between enemies! Tapping the right click makes it throw an electric ball and holding it creates a lightning bolt between the mouse and the cat!\n\n**Water Spell**\n\nWater does small damage but there are a lot of cool combinations with water! Tapping the right click makes it throw a water ball and holding it makes a water beam which bounces off walls.\n\n**Wind Spell**\n\nIt does no damage. Hold right click to push things. Can only be used for puzzles or to push light enemies away.\n\n**Telekinesis Spell**\n\nYou can hold right click to grab light enemies and objects. Throwing an enemy deals damage if it crashes into something!\n\n# \n\n# UI\n\nThis is, more or less, how the game would look like. There might be stuff missing and other stuff I might have to change.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/curcfb0z213g1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fb314d093153de4273ecc732b562a4861ab6d3f\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/im-starting-to-make-my-dream-game-bloombound-and-ive-been-v0-p19iozg7e70g1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef3a65ce6f85c59fbf241f8eaf7c7b53b6b49f77)\n\n**HP**\n\nHp is represented with the flowers that have grown on the tree branch. This is the max number of Hp (10Hp). That means you will start with less HP at the start of the game (5Hp).\n\n**Bloomed Petals**\n\nBloomed Petals are represented with the small petals on top and on the side of the big flower (Which will only bloom when you have atleast 3 petals). These can be used for healing (requires 3 bloomed petals) or the extra skill (Requires 1 bloomed petal). These regenerate over time and take 8 seconds to bloom. You start with 3 Bloomed Petals but can get up to 6.\n\n**Spell Selector**\n\nYou can choose what spells to use using the scroll wheel. It will only show when using scroll wheel and hide after a few seconds of now scrolling. Next spell on the list will display on top and previous spell on the list will display below. Spells with cooldown will appear with a grey color.\n\n**Spell Cooldowns**\n\nThe spell cooldowns will show up on the top-right of the screen and will show which spells are on cooldown and the time it has left to be available to use again.\n\n# Abilities\n\nThese are the first concepts of ideas I had for abilities! (need more ideas for these)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6wp5d5b0313g1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee18dd3ed3b4afccc19d75063b19ea8db7cc263\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/im-starting-to-make-my-dream-game-bloombound-and-ive-been-v0-ywp57njmg70g1.png?width=1173&format=png&auto=webp&s=5debba2eddfc20615e055327466e81bf3ef16c11)\n\n**Gliding**\n\n(I didn't know how to draw this one lol). Two branches grow from the cat's back and petals bloom at the top. This works as a glider!\n\n**Trampoline**\n\nYou can place it anywhere and jump more depending on the height you jumped from! (Only 1 can be placed at the same time)\n\n**Sticky Paw**\n\nYou can find tree sap later to place it on your paws! (You can already climb some walls. This only allows you to climb any/almost any wall).\n\n**Petals and Flower Hearts**\n\nPetals are used to obtain more bloomed petals and flower hearts to get more HP.\n\n**Root Hook**\n\nYou grow a branch which you can use as a hook to swing across gaps!\n\n# Essence Gems\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn306jd4313g1.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc2ad9a176c32778e0f589833a4e7f3cac7b96f9\n\n[](https://preview.redd.it/im-starting-to-make-my-dream-game-bloombound-and-ive-been-v0-ocvvdoi8q70g1.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fd22a88050b72b129944c74c16219bcaf604f3a)\n\nYou can equip up to 5 gems and one special element gem (You will start with only 1 gem slot at the start and no special element slot).

I'm adding **GAMBLING** into my game! I can't share the details, but I have some really cool ideas :)\n\n# End of the post!\n\nAnd I believe that's all! I know I put the general parts of the map, but I don't really have an idea yet on how the full map will look like.

          "text": "It’s fun to theory craft and imagine how cool all your ideas would be, but it’s an entirely different story when you actually start developing a game.\n\nYou don’t really realize how much work goes into a game until you try to make one yourself. It is quite literally a blank slate universe in which you have to tell every single thing what it should be doing. There’s no such thing as an inventory until you create it. There’s no such thing as moving around on an inventory screen until you create it. There’s no such thing as tooltips and equipping items until you create it. There’s no words, no camera, no sound, no visual effects until you create it. No health, no damage, no UI, no death until you create it. The list is genuinely never ending. \n\nI wish you the best but I highly advise you to pick up Godot or Unity and start getting a playable character controller with collision asap to see if this is something you actually wanna do. Theres no point in continuing to develop ideas on paper since your ideas are going to change IMMENSELY after you start. And if you’re the only one making the game, including art and animation, your game is about to shrink to 1/1000th of its original size.",

I started with Godot and even following the tutorial was hard, but atleast I know more than the basics now.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m Brad - Founder & Creative Director of ByCherryMedia, a studio dedicated to helping game developers and publishers with their trailers and marketing content.\n\nSince my last post here a few months ago, a lot has changed:\n\n* After balancing a bar-management job while building this agency on the side, I'm now officially full-time with ByCherryMedia. \n* I’ve partnered with a talented music composer, so we can now offer full custom trailer scoring and soundtracks alongside editing and capture.\n* I now work with a small but sharp team, including an assistant editor, allowing faster turnarounds and bigger projects.\n* We are currently overhauling our entire website with a marketing specialist to better reflect what we actually do.\n* We've had the privilege of working with and having ongoing collaborations with developers/studios like BetaDwarf ([VaultBreakers](https://youtu.be/KboLyUP87fo?si=R0q05t2mEbq2jTgP)), Nyamakop ([Relooted](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DOqmuPzkQoa/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==)), Chugga Games ([Slumber Realm](https://slumberrealm.chuggagames.com)), First Day Entertainment ([Heroes of Magic & Cards](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3843360/Heroes_of_Magic__Cards/)), and several other developers. \n\nWe know how much time, stress, and energy goes into development - especially when marketing tasks start taking over your build time. We're here to help! \n\nWhat We Offer:\n\n1. Cinematic Game Trailers  \nLaunch - Announce - Steam page - Kickstarter  \nCrafted to captivate and convert.\n\n2. High-Impact Social Content  \nShort-form cutdowns - Platform-specific formats  \nBuilt to keep your game visible and shareable.\n\n3. Gameplay Capture & Devlogs  \nGame capture - Dev diaries - Feature spotlights\n\n4. Motion Graphics & Branding  \nStylised titles - UI animation\n\n5. Localisation Support  \nTitle cards - End cards - Subtitles  \nFast and accurate for global audiences.\n\n6. Custom Music & Sound  \nTrailer scoring - Theme development - Full soundtracks\n\n7. Launch & Event Campaign Packages  \nFestivals - Showcases - Releases  \nMulti-format, fast-turnaround content designed to impress.\n\nIf you prefer something more structured, we also offer set packages with clear timelines, price ranges, and deliverables.\n\nMy ideal clients are studios or teams with a budget who want a creative partner - someone who helps shape the narrative, plan shots, guide pacing, and bring the tone of the game to life. But I’m also happy to work with smaller teams or standout solo devs if the project has something special. I’d rather take on fewer projects that I genuinely believe in and can give our all.\n\nI’m currently planning and scoping with new clients now. Actual production work will begin in December, as I’m in the middle of a move (my girlfriend and I are finally moving in together after doing long distance).\n\nIf you want to lock in a December project or something going into the new year, now is the best time to reach out so we can discuss your goals, creative direction, and deadlines.\n\nWhether you need:\n\n* a full trailer\n* gameplay capture\n* devlog editing\n* social cutdowns\n* a cinematic audio score\n* guidance on how to position your game for Steam/Kickstarter\n\nI’m happy to talk - even if it’s just to give feedback on your current material.\n\nWebsite: [https://bycherrymedia.carrd.co/](https://bycherrymedia.carrd.co/) (temporary website)\n\nDrop me a message anytime, add me on Discord (bradcherry), or comment below with a link to your game. I love checking out what people are building.\n\nThanks for reading,  \nBrad - Founder & Creative Director, ByCherryMedia",

The client generates a random temporary key.\n3. The client hashes the device MAC + Windows serial + password, then sends the hashes + the temporary key to the server over HTTPS.\n4. The server verifies the credentials and device hashes, then stores the temporary key for that user for a short time.\n5. When the admin logs in on the web, the server checks username/password, then looks for a valid temporary key linked to that user.\n6. If a valid key exists, the server grants access to the admin panel without extra 2FA.\n\n  \n**What do you think about it**\n\n",

          "text": "A few of thoughts:\n\n* What's step 7 (I'm curious what the use of that temporary key will be?).\n* Windows serial - do you mean the Microsoft product key or the hardware serial number? If it is the Microsoft serial that can be changed/forged. Similarly, the same can be done with the MAC.\n* Additionally, if someone is snooping on a network, the MAC would be discoverable. So too would be the serial (whether hardware or a software serial) if someone had access to the device.\n* You seem to be trying to authenticate both the device and the user (admin). If something happens to that device, the user won't ever be able to authenticate again unless they have memorized the MAC and serial (and then forge those). That creates an availability issue.\n* The above two points raise the question of the value of using them as part of the hash, as though they are a salt. Typically, you want random unique information.\n* Ultimately, your key sharing is just sending the key back and forth (client generates and then sends it to the server. I'd look at challenge-response handshakes. \n* Remember the rule \"To authenticate, you must initiate!\" If you are trying to confirm the identity of some thing or someone, you have to start the transaction. For example: The server should initiate the transaction (send a message to the client). The client then returns that message, hashed with some pre-shared key. Server compares that message to its already computed version, if they match, the client has the right key (maybe this is step 7 in your scenario and you're just focused on how get that key there to start; if so apologies for not following). \n* If that is the case, then I would say rather than the pre shared key being the values of the MAC and serial, make it a genuine key (long and random). This not only enhances security but it allows the system to be portable to other devices. It also allows you to change that key.",

All you need is a pickup truck. 50 yards at $20 is very doable! I would charge $25, though, to account for gas. Honestly, you should charge $30 to $40, depending on where you live, but you’re trying to reach $1000, not start a business. You want them to say, “Hell yeah, you can cut my yard for $25!”\n\n50 yards in two days is 25 yards each day. You should have 8 hours of daylight. I would start as early as possible. Also, you want to aim for 3 to 4 yards per hour. Also, don’t even think about large lawns, due to your time constraints. Just target neighborhoods that look like they need some work. Half the time, if you explain what you’re doing, they’ll just say, “Sure, just don’t mess it up.” After you cut someone’s yard, ask them if they know anyone who can help you out. That’s honestly how I got the amount I needed. I bounced from yard to yard the whole first day, just from people calling family and saying, “This kid wants some help raising some money, and he’ll cut your grass for $20!” He did alright. Then, boom! I would get an address and be off.\n\nYou will be hurting after, and you should take plenty of water, but I’ll be damned if you don’t make the money! Just don’t look like you’re going to rob them blind. Show your face, smile, and be nice. I would even buy a lawnmower lol I’m that certain you will make the money back plus what you need. Oh and be very respectful with peoples yards. Some people are about that yard lol",

Had a good running business with 10 employees by the time I left after 5 years.   \n\\- 12 years graphic design experience  \n\\- 4 years wordpress web design + dev experience (coded themes from scratch)\n\nWhat I would like from a new job:  \n\\- managing my own time / space (remote work preferrably)  \n\\- strategic + analytical thinking (a big part of business ownership that I loved)  \n\\- wouldn't mind working with a creative team  \n\\- keeps me own my toes, ie challenging and both analytical and creative\n\nWhat I don't want:  \n\\- to do the grunt work, like graphic designing or web dev again. I've had my fill  \n\\- Just sit and do social media / google ads all day and stress about the results.\n\nWhat can you suggest that I could look into?   \nTo add I'm also happy to further my knowledge (would love to actually) but don't want to have to get a degree right now.\n\nThank you!

Add Great Expectations for data quality and send alerts to Slack. Expose a clean gold dataset to data science via a small FastAPI service behind API Gateway with keys/OAuth and versioned endpoints. Document the whole thing, use Docker for local dev, Terraform for basics, and a tiny GitHub Actions CI.\n\nFree learning > subscriptions: AWS Skill Builder or Google Cloud Skill Boosts, dbt Learn, Prefect and FastAPI docs, and Snowflake/BigQuery free tiers.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m architecting a data ingestion pipeline in n8n where data integrity is critical. I can't afford to lose payloads if my database goes down or times out.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfb76zjm403g1.png?width=1807&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cb51c63fe35c5d382c547811daf38854e2fd3b7\n\nI’ve set up a **\"Self-Healing\" architecture** and I wanted to get a sanity check on my error handling logic, specifically regarding how to *test* it properly.\n\n**The Setup:**\n\n1. **Source:** Webhook receives a batch of JSON data.\n2. **Primary Load:** Tries to `Upsert` into Supabase (Postgres Node).\n   * *Settings:* **Retry on Fail (3 times), On Error: continue (using error output), 60s connection timeout**\n3. **The Safety Net:** I’ve connected the **Error Output (Gray Dot)** of the Postgres node directly to a Google Sheets node.\n4. **Logic:** If Postgres fails (timeout/connection refused), the raw JSON payload is dumped into the Sheet (\"Dead Letter Queue\") for later recovery.\n\n**The Question:** How do you guys reliably simulate a \"Database Down\" scenario to verify the fallback path works?\n\nI don't want to just test \"Bad Password\" (Auth error), I want to simulate a hang/timeout to ensure the Retry logic fires before the Fallback triggers.\n\n**Methods I've tried:**\n\n1. **The \"Fake Host\" method:** Changing the Postgres host to a non-existent IP (e.g. `203.0.113.1`) to force a timeout.\n2. **The \"Sabotage Query\" method:** Changing the node to 'Execute Query' and running `SET statement_timeout = 1; SELECT pg_sleep(1);` to force a runtime crash.\n\nBoth are a bit flaky and I don't know if they really simulate the real life crashes as I had almost zero database experience.\n\nIs there a standard pattern for this? Also, has anyone run into issues where the \"Error Output\" doesn't trigger on specific types of Postgres errors (like `ECONNRESET`)?\n\nAny tips on making this bulletproof would be appreciated.\n\nThanks!",

          "text": "Best way to verify your fallback is to break the network, not the query: inject latency/drops so retries fire, then confirm the error output hits Sheets.\n\nPractical drills:\n\n\\- Put Postgres behind Toxiproxy and point n8n at the proxy. Toggle timeout, latency, and reset\\_peer to simulate hangs and ECONNRESET. This is the most repeatable.\n\n\\- If DB runs in Docker, docker pause to simulate a hang (connections stall) and docker stop/restart for connection refused. On bare metal, add a firewall rule to drop or tcp-reset traffic to port 5432 for the DB IP.\n\n\\- Shorten connect/statement timeouts during tests (e.g., 5–10s) so you iterate faster and actually hit the retry path.\n\nHarden the pattern:\n\n\\- Pre-step health check (quick SELECT 1 with short timeout); if it fails, skip the upsert and go straight to DLQ.\n\n\\- Add idempotency (hash of key fields) so replaying Sheets doesn’t create dupes.\n\n\\- Batch small, cap concurrency, and add backoff to avoid Sheet rate limits; consider a real DLQ (SQS, Redis list) if volume grows.\n\nI’ve used Toxiproxy and Pumba for fault injection; DreamFactory can sit in front of Postgres or Supabase REST to flip mock/live and set per-key quotas without changing your n8n nodes.\n\nBottom line: simulate failures at the network layer (Toxiproxy/docker pause/firewall), then layer a health check and idempotency around your fallback",

      "text": "Hey everyone, \n\nI would like to set up infrastructure that allows to automatically evaluate RAG systems essentially similar to how traditional ML models are evaluated with metrics like F1 score, accuracy, etc., but adapted to text-generation + retrieval. Which metrics, tools, or techniques work best for RAG evaluation? Thoughts on tools like RAGAS, TruLens, DeepEval, LangSmith or any others? Which ones are reliable, scalable, and easy to integrate?\n\nI am considering using n8n for the RAGs, GitHub/Azure DevOps for versioning, and vector a database (Postgres, Qdrant, etc.). What infrastructure do you use to run reproducible benchmarks or regression tests for RAG pipelines? \n\nI would really appreciate it if anyone can give me insight into what to use. Thanks!",

I am now trying to implement Cohere reranker to see how helpful it is to retrieve the data without any filters. \n\n\n\nI feel the filter would be the best for my use case, since when I filter the data for June 2023, the filter gives the LLM only 3 data outputs to deal with (filter with month: May to June 2023, June to July 2023). \n\nBut when I used the Cohere reranker (provided with input of 25 from initial cosine similarity search to fetch the top 5), it was only able to fetch May to June 2023 results, while all the others were irrelevant data.\n\nDo you think my approach is correct?

      "text": "Hi I am new to building RAG systems and I am facing some problem.   \nI’m building a tool for sub-contractors in construction who need to read through a ton of documents uploaded by general contractors before placing their bids. Instead of going through everything manually, they can ask questions, and the system answers using a RAG setup (vector DB + embeddings + LLM). It’s all built with AWS services, S3 as the document source, retrieval, reranking, LLM answering, etc.\n\nEverything works fine for specific questions that tie directly to the documents.\n\nBut here’s the problem:  \nUsers often ask general, high-level questions like *“Are there any risks in this contract?”* or *“Is there anything I should watch out for?”* The issue is that general contractors don’t explicitly write “risks” in their documents. So the vector DB can’t really pull anything meaningful, because nothing says “risk,” and the LLM ends up giving vague or useless answers.   \nI thought increasing number of documents fetched would help so I retrieved 18 documents and after reranking 6 documents but still for llm to fully understand if there are any risks involved, llm will definetly need full document context. (also to note : one general contractor may upload 4-5 documents.) \n\nSo now I’m stuck with this :   \nRAG does great when the question maps to something written, but completely falls apart when the question is broad and the answer requires interpreting or inferring things that aren’t directly stated.   \nDo I need to use better prompt ? or Do I need to change architecture ? or anything else ? I also heard about query expansion and Agentic RAG (will it be expensive and also useful ?)\n\njust for reference :   \nI used aws knowledge base with Aurora rds serverless pgvector and aws titan G1 embedding with 1536 dimentions. I tried opensearch as well but it's expensive and tried pinecone as well but I think it will also get expensive.",

      "text": "# 7 Habits of Highly Effective AI Prompts \n\nThis ideas come from the book *7 Habits of Highly Effective People*  and you can implement them into your prompting.\n---\n\n## 1. Ask “What’s within my control here?”\n\nPerfect for moments of overwhelm or frustration.  \nAI helps you separate what you can influence from what you can’t.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “My startup funding got delayed. What’s within my control here?”  \n\nThis instantly shifts focus to actionable steps and resilience.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Use “Help me begin with the end in mind”\n\nGame-changer for any decision or plan.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “I’m planning a podcast launch. Help me begin with the end in mind.”  \n\nAI helps you define your vision, identify success metrics, and work backward to design a roadmap.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Say “What should I put first?”\n\nThe ultimate prioritization prompt.  \nWhen everything feels urgent, this cuts through the noise.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “I’m juggling client work, content creation, and networking. What should I put first?”  \n\nAI helps you align your actions with what truly matters most right now.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Add “How can we both win here?”\n\nPerfect for conflicts, collaborations, or negotiations.  \nInstead of win-lose thinking, AI helps uncover creative solutions where everyone benefits.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “My coworker wants more design freedom, but I need brand consistency. How can we both win here?”  \n\nThis prompt encourages empathy and innovation in problem-solving.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Ask “What am I missing by not really listening?”\n\nThis one’s sneaky powerful.  \nPaste in an email or describe a conversation, then ask this.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “Here’s a message from my client — what am I missing by not really listening?”  \n\nAI spots underlying needs, emotions, and perspectives you might have overlooked.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Use “How can I combine these strengths?”\n\nWhen you’re stuck or brainstorming new ideas, list your skills and ask this.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “I’m skilled in storytelling and data analysis. How can I combine these strengths?”  \n\nAI helps you discover innovative intersections — like turning insights into compelling narratives.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Say “Help me sharpen the saw on this”\n\nThe self-renewal prompt.  \nAI helps you design sustainable improvement plans for any skill or habit.  \n\n> Example:  \n> “Help me sharpen the saw on my leadership and communication skills.”  \n\nYou’ll get targeted, practical steps for continuous personal growth.\n\n---\n\n## Why These Work\n\nThe magic happens because these habits are designed to **shift your perspective**.  \nAI amplifies this by processing your situation through these mental models instantly — helping you respond with clarity, creativity, and confidence.\n\n---\n\n[Source](agenticworkers.com)",

People forget that subtraction is a decision too.​\n* Turn \"begin with the end in mind\" into a reusable template, not a one-off: goal, time horizon, constraints, success/failure signals, then ask the model to tell you what *not* to bother with. That last part is where the real leverage is.​\n* Pair the \"how can we both win\" and \"what am I missing by not really listening\" prompts and make the model write your counterpart’s steelman position first. If it cannot argue their side well, you are negotiating with a caricature.​\n* Add an unofficial Habit 8: \"Act as my skeptical reviewer - what here sounds nice but would fall apart in real life, and what would I track weekly to prove this is working?\"\n\nI have seen people burn hours with prompts that never force tradeoffs. This set at least points the gun in the right direction.",

      "text": "[archgw](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw) (a models-native sidecar proxy for AI agents) offered two capabilities that required loading small LLMs in memory: guardrails to prevent jailbreak attempts, and function-calling for routing requests to the right downstream tool or agent. These built-in features required the project running a thread-safe python process that used libs like transformers, torch, safetensors, etc. 500M in dependencies, not to mention all the security vulnerabilities in the dep tree. Not hating on python, but our GH project was flagged with all sorts of issues.\n\nThose models are loaded as a separate out-of-process server via ollama/lama.cpp which are built in C++/Go. Lighter, faster and safer. And ONLY if the developer uses these features of the product. This meant 9000 lines of less code, a total start time of <2 seconds (vs 30+ seconds), etc.\n\nWhy archgw? So that you can build AI agents in any language or framework and offload the plumbing work in AI (like agent routing/hand-off, guardrails, zero-code logs and traces, and a unified API for all LLMs) to a durable piece of infrastructure, deployed as a sidecar.\n\nProud of this release, so sharing 🙏\n\nP.S Sample demos, the CLI and some tests still use python. But we'll move those over to Rust in the coming months. We are punting convenience for robustness.",

ChatGPT is still my main for outlining and rewriting captions, Nano Banana is fun for quick visuals but it gets chaotic real fast, and Haliuo ai has been pretty solid for structured posts but feels a little stiff at times. somewhere in the middle of all that i tried DomoAI for video bits and it surprised me since i didn’t expect the motion results to look that clean. not a full replacement for the bigger tools or anything but it kinda held up when mixing images with video prompts.\n\nanyway, the dream tool for me would do stuff like:\n\n* graphics + captions for socials\n* auto reels shorts tiktoks\n* short explainers for youtube\n* repurpose text into something visual without making it look template-y\n\nand ideally i want something that exports to linkedin, ig, or yt without having to redo the whole layout every single time. brand colors would be nice too so I don’t keep re-entering hex codes like a clown.\n\nCurious what everyone here is actually using right now that saves real time. free or paid is fine. i’m mainly looking for tools that don’t break flow, especially if you’re juggling carousels, reels, and written content in one sitting.\n\nIf you’ve tested multiple, feel free to break down what flopped and what didn’t. trying to avoid going down another 3-day rabbit hole testing everything on the internet lol.",

      "text": "I've been studying Carlin's approach to language and society and realized his razor-sharp skepticism is absolutely devastating as AI prompts. It's like having the ultimate BS detector analyze every aspect of your life:\n\n**1. \"What's the real reason people say this?\"**\n\nCarlin never accepted surface explanations. AI cuts through social niceties. \n\n> \"Everyone says 'follow your passion' for career advice. What's the real reason people say this?\" \n\nExposes the hidden agendas.\n\n**2. \"What euphemisms am I using to avoid the truth?\"**\n\nLanguage as camouflage detection. \n\n> \"I say I'm 'between opportunities' instead of unemployed. What euphemisms am I using to avoid the truth?\" \n\nAI strips away your comfortable lies.\n\n**3. \"Who benefits from me believing this?\"**\n\nCarlin's favorite question about conventional wisdom. \n\n> \"I'm told I need to buy a house to be successful. Who benefits from me believing this?\" \n\nAI follows the money and power.\n\n**4. \"What would happen if I said the quiet part out loud?\"**\n\nCarlin's specialty was making the implicit explicit. \n\n> \"Everyone pretends remote work is about productivity. What would happen if I said the quiet part out loud?\" \n\nReveals unspoken truths.\n\n**5. \"What contradictions am I living with and pretending don't exist?\"**\n\nCognitive dissonance detector. \n\n> \"I preach work-life balance but answer emails at midnight. What contradictions am I living with and pretending don't exist?\" \n\nBrutal self-awareness.\n\n**6. \"How is this situation fundamentally absurd?\"**\n\nCarlin saw absurdity everywhere. AI spots your participation in nonsense. \n\n> \"I spend hours curating my social media to look authentic. How is this situation fundamentally absurd?\" \n\nReality check hits hard.\n\n**The breakthrough:** Carlin proved that most of what we accept is performance and bullshit. AI helps you see through your own act.\n\n**Power technique:** Stack the skepticism. \n\n> \"What's the real reason? Who benefits? What's absurd about this?\" \n\nComplete BS audit of any situation.\n\n**7. \"What am I performing instead of being?\"**\n\nIdentity vs. authenticity. \n\n> \"I'm a 'thought leader' on LinkedIn. What am I performing instead of being?\" \n\nAI calls out your personal theater.\n\n**8. \"What would a complete outsider think about this normal thing I do?\"**\n\nAlien anthropologist perspective. \n\n> \"I pay $200/month for a gym I visit twice. What would a complete outsider think about this normal thing I do?\" \n\nMakes the familiar strange.\n\n**9. \"What rules am I following that make zero actual sense?\"**\n\nQuestion arbitrary authority. \n\n> \"I wear uncomfortable clothes to work because it's 'professional.' What rules am I following that make zero actual sense?\" \n\nAI liberates you from meaningless conventions.\n\n**Secret weapon:** Add \n> \"George Carlin would expose this by...\"\n\nto any situation that feels off. AI channels decades of piercing social commentary.\n\n**10. \"What am I afraid to admit because it would make me look bad?\"**\n\nCarlin's radical honesty. \n\n> \"I claim to care about climate change but take 3 vacations a year. What am I afraid to admit because it would make me look bad?\" \n\nTruth hurts, then frees.\n\n**Advanced move:** Use this for group dynamics. \n\n> \"What's everyone pretending not to notice in this meeting?\" \n\nCarlin's eye for collective delusion.\n\n**11. \"How am I participating in something I claim to oppose?\"**\n\nHypocrisy detector on full blast. \n\n> \"I criticize consumerism while refreshing Amazon. How am I participating in something I claim to oppose?\" \n\nAI won't let you off the hook.\n\n**12. \"What's the dumbest thing I believe because everyone else believes it?\"**\n\nMass delusion identifier. \n\n> \"Everyone says you need to hustle 24/7. What's the dumbest thing I believe because everyone else believes it?\" \n\nAI questions your herd mentality.\n\nIt's like having the most honest person in history as your personal truth-teller.\n\n**Reality check:** Carlin's approach can make you cynical if you're not careful. Balance the skepticism with \"What actually matters to me?\" to stay grounded.\n\n**The multiplier:** Carlin's genius was spotting patterns in language and behavior that reveal deeper truths. AI processes your life through that same critical lens.\n\n**Mind shift:** Use \"What am I doing for show versus what's real?\" for any area where you feel inauthentic. Carlin never performed authenticity - he just was.\n\n**13. \"If I removed all the bullshit, what would actually be left?\"**\n\nThe ultimate reduction. \n\n> \"I have 47 self-improvement goals. If I removed all the bullshit, what would actually be left?\" \n\nAI finds your true priorities.\n\nWhat's one thing you're doing because you think you're supposed to, not because you actually want to? Carlin would tell you to stop immediately.\n\nIf you are keen to explore persona based AI mega prompts, visit our [free collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/) of well categorized prompts",

I’m new to the community, so I hope I’m doing everything right.\n\nEver since Gemini 3 came out, I’ve been really excited about it. I keep experimenting with the Build feature, and I wanted to share my latest project with you.\n\nI work as an engineer in the solar energy sector, and people often ask me questions about installing panels on their own rooftop — things like *How many panels do I need? How much will it cost? What’s the payback period?* So I built a tool that answers all of these questions.\n\nThe tool asks you for a few inputs such as your location, monthly electricity bill, roof tilt, available roof area, etc. Based on that, it calculates how many panels you need, the estimated cost, and more. I also expanded the app by adding an agricultural irrigation calculator for farmers. In my region, most farmlands don’t have grid access, so solar-powered irrigation is very common. With this feature, farmers can calculate the pump power they need and the number of panels required.\n\nHowever, it still has some limitations. If you want truly accurate production estimates, you need to input the roof’s orientation and tilt correctly. Some software can do this by letting you locate your house on Google Earth, outline the roof surfaces, and even draw each angled section separately. This lets the software calculate both panel capacity and expected performance based on the actual solar angle. That’s an important factor when determining how many panels will realistically fit.\n\nAnyway, this is where my motivation dropped. There’s no way to implement something like this in the Build section of AI Studio. At that point it started to feel like just a fancy calculator. I want to turn this into a real product, but I don’t know how to build advanced features like that within the current system.\n\nIf link-sharing is allowed, I can share the link to the app in the comments.",

As someone who also dives into solar energy projects, I think it's great that you're addressing common questions like the number of panels required and cost estimates. It might even be helpful for users to consolidate their research on solar energy into concise summaries. Have you ever considered using something like SummaryForge? It helps transform complex ebooks and articles into easy-to-read summaries, which could provide users with quick insights on solar panel installation and efficiency. You can check it out at https://summaryforge.com.",

      "text": "It seems that Claude has all the knowledge it would need to know my domain and look at my workflow to suggest and create skills without me having to manually do this.  Sort of like a skill to create skills. \n\nFor example if Claude sees that I always want unit tests and how I write them it could/should detect this and suggest this as a Skill.\n\nHere is a prompt that Claude came up with to do just this.  I am just starting to play with it but thought I would pass it along.  Does anyone else have any Skills tips or knowledge they can pass along?\n\n  \n`# Workflow Pattern Detection & Skill Suggestion System`\n\n\n\n`Implement a comprehensive workflow pattern detection system that learns from user behavior patterns and suggests automation opportunities through both repetition tracking and intelligent single-request analysis. The system dynamically adapts to user expertise and maintains awareness of user context, patterns, goals, and objectives to generate relevant skills.`\n\n\n\n`## CORE REQUIREMENTS:`\n\n\n\n`### 1. CREATE TRACKING FILE: \\`.claude/workflow_patterns.md\\``\n\n`- Track every workflow pattern used (commit/push, prototyping, testing, analysis, etc.)`\n\n`- Increment count each time the same workflow is requested`\n\n`- Categorize requests: Workflow, Question, Bug Fix, Feature, Analysis, Creative, Administrative`\n\n`- Include: Pattern name, count, threshold, status, notes, complexity score, domain context`\n\n`- Maintain user context profile including expertise areas, goals, and behavioral patterns`\n\n\n\n`### 2. DUAL DETECTION SYSTEM:`\n\n\n\n`**A. REPETITION-BASED DETECTION:**`\n\n`- Adaptive thresholds based on detected user expertise level`\n\n`- Allow override: If user says \"track but don't make skill\", mark as TRACK_NO_SKILL and never suggest again`\n\n\n\n`**B. IMMEDIATE COMPLEXITY DETECTION:**`\n\n`Suggest skills immediately (count = 1) when detecting:`\n\n`- Multi-step analysis requests combining 3+ evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Tasks requiring domain expertise application`\n\n`- Complex workflows spanning multiple tools/files/systems`\n\n`- Comprehensive evaluation or review requests`\n\n`- Tasks involving specialized knowledge patterns`\n\n`- Multi-phase project workflows`\n\n\n\n`### 3. ENHANCED PATTERN RECOGNITION:`\n\n\n\n`**Semantic Grouping:**`\n\n`- Group similar requests under broader patterns`\n\n`- Example: \"debug X\", \"troubleshoot Y\", \"fix Z\" → \"Debugging Workflow\"`\n\n`- \"analyze performance\", \"check security\", \"review code quality\" → \"Comprehensive Code Analysis\"`\n\n\n\n`**Dynamic Context Awareness:**`\n\n`- Learn user's domain expertise from conversation history and stated background`\n\n`- Recognize domain-specific triggers based on user's professional context`\n\n`- Track technologies, tools, and methodologies frequently mentioned`\n\n`- Identify recurring project types and structures`\n\n`- Note specialized terminology and frameworks user employs`\n\n`- Understand user's goals and objectives to align skill suggestions`\n\n`- Recognize user's behavioral patterns and preferred approaches`\n\n\n\n`### 4. SKILL SUGGESTION FORMAT:`\n\n\n\n`**For Repetition-Based:**`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n`🤖 Pattern Detected: You've asked me to [pattern] X times.`\n\n`Should I create a skill to automate this workflow?`\n\n`Proposed: [skill-name]`\n\n`- [What it would do]`\n\n`- [Why it's useful for your workflow and goals]`\n\n`- [Time/effort savings expected]`\n\n`- [How it aligns with your expertise/patterns]`\n\n`Create this skill? (yes/no)`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`**For Immediate Complexity-Based:**`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n`💡 Skill Opportunity: This looks like a reusable framework that could benefit from automation.`\n\n`Proposed: [skill-name]`\n\n`- [What it would automate]`\n\n`- [Domain expertise it would capture]`\n\n`- [How it fits your technical background and objectives]`\n\n`- [Consistency benefits for your workflow patterns]`\n\n`Create this skill now? (yes/no)`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`### 5. ADAPTIVE PATTERN EXAMPLES:`\n\n\n\n`**Development Workflows:**`\n\n`- Version control operations (commit, push, branching strategies)`\n\n`- Dependency management and updates`\n\n`- Performance profiling and optimization`\n\n`- Security vulnerability scanning`\n\n`- Code review and quality assessment processes`\n\n`- Test suite execution and analysis`\n\n`- Build and deployment automation`\n\n\n\n`**Analysis Workflows:**`\n\n`- Comprehensive codebase evaluation (performance/security/maintainability/architecture)`\n\n`- System monitoring setup and configuration`\n\n`- Database optimization and analysis`\n\n`- Application health checks and diagnostics`\n\n`- Documentation review and generation`\n\n\n\n`**Creative/Communication Workflows:**`\n\n`- Content editing with consistent style guidelines`\n\n`- Technical documentation generation`\n\n`- Presentation or report creation`\n\n`- Review processes for written content`\n\n\n\n`**Administrative Workflows:**`\n\n`- Project planning and organization`\n\n`- Meeting preparation and follow-up`\n\n`- Research and information gathering`\n\n`- Decision-making frameworks`\n\n\n\n`### 6. FILE FORMAT:`\n\n`\\`\\`\\`markdown`\n\n`# Workflow Pattern Tracking`\n\n`Last Updated: [timestamp]`\n\n`User Domain Context: [Learned from interactions]`\n\n`User Goals/Objectives: [Identified from conversations]`\n\n`User Expertise Level: [Beginner/Intermediate/Expert - Auto-detected]`\n\n`User Behavioral Patterns: [Preferred approaches, methodologies]`\n\n\n\n`## [Pattern Name] (Count: X, Status: Tracking/TRACK_NO_SKILL/Skill Created, Complexity: High/Medium/Low)`\n\n`Pattern: [Description]`\n\n`Detection Method: Repetition/Complexity/Both`\n\n`Threshold: [Adaptive based on expertise] (suggest skill) OR Immediate (complex task)`\n\n`Next Suggestion: At count [N] OR N/A (immediate)`\n\n`Domain Context: [User's relevant expertise area]`\n\n`Technologies/Tools Involved: [List]`\n\n`Frequency: [Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Project-based]`\n\n`Impact: [Time saved/Consistency gained/Quality improvement]`\n\n`Goal Alignment: [How this supports user's objectives]`\n\n`Notes: [Context and reasoning]`\n\n`\\`\\`\\``\n\n\n\n`### 7. CONTEXTUAL SKILL DETECTION TRIGGERS:`\n\n\n\n`**Immediate Suggestion Triggers:**`\n\n`- Requests combining multiple evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Multi-step technical analysis workflows`\n\n`- Domain expertise applications (based on learned user context)`\n\n`- Comprehensive project or system evaluation requests`\n\n`- Style-consistent creative or technical feedback requests`\n\n`- Complex decision-making processes`\n\n`- Multi-tool workflow coordination`\n\n\n\n`**Dynamic Domain Recognition:**`\n\n`- Learn user's expertise areas from conversation patterns`\n\n`- Identify specialized knowledge domains user frequently references`\n\n`- Recognize when user applies professional methodology`\n\n`- Detect recurring technical stacks or frameworks`\n\n`- Note consistent quality standards or evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Understand user's current projects and long-term goals`\n\n\n\n`### 8. UPDATE RULES:`\n\n`- Increment count every time pattern is used`\n\n`- Update timestamp and add contextual notes`\n\n`- Learn and update user domain context, goals, and patterns from each interaction`\n\n`- For repetition-based: Report \"✅ Tracked [pattern] (X times, threshold: [adaptive])\"`\n\n`- For complexity-based: Report \"💡 Complex workflow detected: [pattern]\"`\n\n`- At session start, read file to know existing patterns and learned user context`\n\n`- Group semantically similar requests under broader pattern categories`\n\n`- Adapt detection sensitivity based on user's expertise level and objectives`\n\n\n\n`### 9. SEMANTIC ANALYSIS:`\n\n`- Detect variations of same underlying task using different terminology`\n\n`- Recognize when different phrasings represent same workflow intent`\n\n`- Identify complex workflows that span multiple requests within sessions`\n\n`- Track workflow evolution (simple request → complex systematic approach)`\n\n`- Learn user's preferred terminology and methodology patterns`\n\n\n\n`### 10. LEARNING SYSTEM:`\n\n`- Build understanding of user's professional background from conversations`\n\n`- Identify recurring themes, technologies, and methodologies`\n\n`- Recognize user's quality standards and evaluation criteria`\n\n`- Adapt suggestion timing based on user's workflow complexity preferences`\n\n`- Learn from user feedback on skill suggestions to improve future detection`\n\n`- Maintain awareness of user's current projects and strategic objectives`\n\n`- Track user's evolving expertise and adjust recommendations accordingly`\n\n\n\n`### 11. ADAPTIVE THRESHOLD SYSTEM:`\n\n`- **Beginner Detection:** Simple, single-tool requests, basic terminology`\n\n  `- Higher repetition threshold (5 occurrences before suggestion)`\n\n  `- Focus on fundamental workflow automation`\n\n`- **Intermediate Detection:** Multi-step processes, some domain terminology`\n\n  `- Standard threshold (3 occurrences)`\n\n  `- Balance between automation and learning opportunities`  \n\n`- **Expert Detection:** Complex analysis, specialized terminology, advanced methodology`\n\n  `- Lower repetition threshold (2 occurrences)`\n\n  `- Immediate suggestions for sophisticated workflows`\n\n`- **Dynamic Adjustment:** Modify thresholds as user expertise becomes apparent through interactions`\n\n`- **Context-Aware Timing:** Consider user's current goals and project phases when suggesting skills`\n\n\n\n`## INITIALIZATION:`\n\n`Start tracking now. Create the workflow_patterns.md file and begin monitoring all workflow patterns using both detection methods. Learn user context dynamically from interactions including expertise level, goals, behavioral patterns, and objectives. Adapt detection criteria accordingly and maintain ongoing awareness of who the user is, their patterns, and what they're trying to accomplish. Prioritize immediate suggestions for complex analysis tasks while building repetition history for simpler workflows. Always consider how proposed skills align with the user's broader objectives and working style.`",

A few weeks ago it was totally fine, now it takes forever to respond or just hangs.  \nWhat’s weird is that if I switch to **Gemini 2.5 Pro using my API key**, everything is super fast. So the API is fine — it’s literally just the **CLI free tier** that’s slow.  \nSame prompts, same setup. It used to be quick, now it’s painfully slow.  \nIs anyone else seeing this? Did Google change something on the free tier?  \nJust want to know if it’s a general issue or something on my side. Thanks!",

But the voice recognition is terrible. And just to clarify, I mean speech-to-text, because when it comes to the Live mode or Voice Mode, it works fine.\n\nBut if I want to dictate something and have Gemini turn that into text, it performs horribly. It just can’t capture what I’m saying accurately.\n\nDoes anyone know if there's an update coming soon that might improve this?\nI love Gemini, but for me, dictation is way easier, and in that aspect, Gemini is awful.\n\nJust as additional information, I've noticed this bad performance on both English and Spanish speech-to-text.

          "text": "Testing and certifying AI agents before deploying them in real workflows is indeed a critical concern. Here are some considerations and approaches that could be useful:\n\n- **Agent-Specific Metrics**: Implement metrics tailored for evaluating agents, such as tool selection quality, action advancement, and action completion. These metrics can help assess how well agents perform at various stages of their tasks.\n\n- **Visibility into Planning and Tool Use**: Ensure that every step of the agent's decision-making process is logged and visualized. This can help identify areas for optimization and provide insights into the agent's performance.\n\n- **Cost and Latency Tracking**: Monitor the performance of agents in terms of cost and latency. This can help balance efficiency and effectiveness, ensuring that agents operate within acceptable parameters.\n\n- **Non-Deterministic Paths Evaluation**: Since agents can take multiple paths to achieve a goal, it's essential to evaluate their performance across these different paths to understand their reliability and robustness.\n\n- **Error Handling and Edge Cases**: Develop testing scenarios that focus on how agents handle errors and edge cases. This includes assessing their ability to recognize when tool usage is unnecessary or when they need to request more information from users.\n\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a feedback loop where agents can learn from their interactions and improve over time. This can be achieved by collecting data from real-world usage and refining the agents based on this data.\n\n- **Community Collaboration**: Engage with the community to share best practices and insights on testing methodologies. This could lead to the development of a standardized framework for agent evaluation.\n\nFor more detailed insights on evaluating AI agents, you might find the following resource helpful: [Introducing Agentic Evaluations - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3zymprct).",
