Like the one reaching the hand to help the climb, did you do random seed trials or solely using very detailed prompt? Also, did you use motion guidance like dwpose or other controlnet for the image and video?\nFor upscaling, I also leaning towards seedvr2 than USDU, but it maybe because my hardware limit and my custom workflow making skill.\nIs this the final product or you will make the better one or continuation of this?",

I do specify the things I don’t want to see in the negative prompt, but the whole process is really close to what you’d get in a movie set asking the actors to repeat takes over and over. It’s closer to say David Fincher instead of Clint Eastwood, because I can end up with 70 or 80 takes until it get something I like. What’s great about the other 79 takes is that I can always recycle actions or expressions to use in a “first frame 2 last frame” workflow. It’s a truly fascinating process.",

              "text": "There are like dozens people asking for prompts and this is the highest comment so i will answer this. For a single scene you need two different prompts, that are COMPLETELY different and guided by different goal you try to achieve. First you make an image. You use precise language, compose the scene and describe it. You need to think like a robot here. If you describe something as beautiful or breathtaking you're making a huge mistake. It should be almost like captioning a lora dataset.\n\nThen there is a i2v prompt. It should NOT describe what is on the image, unless there is a movement that could uncover different angle of something or introduce new elements by camera movements. Just use basic guidance, to pinpoint the elements and action it will perform. I don't have the exact prompt, because i just delete it after generation, but for example, the firepit scene at night would go something like this:\n\nWe introduce the new element, a man who is not on the initial image, so you describe him. You don't need much because he is visibile from behind and has little movement. Apart from describing the crackling fire with smoke, slight camera turn, etc etc, the most important bits would be something like this:\n\nAn athletic man wearing white t-shirt and blue jeans enters the scene from the left. His movement are smooth as he slowly and gently puts his hand on the woman shoulder causing her to register his presence. She firstly quickly peeks at his hand on her shoulder then proceeds to turn her head towards him. Her facial expression is the mix of curiosity and affection as her eyes dart upwards towards his face. She is completely at ease and finds comfort in the presence of the man who approached her.\n\nThings get really messy when you have dynamic scenes with much action, but the principle is the same. For firing a gun you don't write \"fires a gun\", you write \"She pulls the trigger of a handgun she is holding in her extended right hand causing it to fire. The force of the handgun recoil causes her muscles to twitch, the shot is accompanied by the muzzle flash, ejection of the empty shell and exhaust gases. She retains her composoure focusing on the target in front of her\"  \n\n\nSo for image you are a robot taking pictures, for i2v you are George R.R Martin.",

Seeing her necklace and not seeing it, made me wonder where it went.  While the painted lanes on the road always seem to get me, these were close, as they drove in the outside lane before turning right, but it's all still good enough.\n\nI'm really going hard with criticism after just a single viewing, as to try and help shape our future with this technology.  I support the use of local generation and production tools.  The resolution is very nice.\n\nGreat detail in the write up description too!

I mean those stuffs confuse me. Also how exacly you tell them what they should do like walk, run, be sad its like animating but with prompts?

The girl is in the foreground with the gold, but what's interesting is the shadow on the ground (next to the protagonist's) of a guy with a video camera, as if he were recording her.\n\nb) What problem did you have with the shots of the car on the road, in terms of quality, compared to the rest of the shots, that made such a difference, when the quality of the nighttime water scene is impeccable?\n\nc) What was the pre-production of the video like? Did you create a script, a storyboard, to decide what and how to view it in each sequence?\n\nd) At what fps did you render it before post-pro, and how many did you change it to in post-pro?\n\ne) Was it a deliberate decision not to add audio to the video instead of a song? Audio is the other 50% when it comes to immersion, and the song makes you disconnect from what you get from the images.\n\nThat said, what you've done is truly amazing. Congratulations.",

Firstly, the timelapse itself degraded the quality, then there was degradation from extending + headlights edit.\n\nc) I made a storyboard with rough stick figures with what i would like to have in the video and gradually filled it up. Then i remade 1/3 of it because it turned out to be extremely dark and brutal borderline gore&porn video i couldn't show to anyone. Hence the psychokiller theme that might now sound quite odd for mountaing hitchhiking :D\n\nd) 16->24\n\ne) Yeah, it was supposed to be a music video clip.",

And really the only reason to have redundancy in a homelab is to be able to rotate \"critical\" services to another node via HA systems while you update one node, but that's not critical at all in a homelab environment.",

I use Kubernetes because I work in IT and use Kubernetes in my homelab is a great way to study and practice.\n\nIs worth this kinda of setup (containers) because you can share the resources in your big server when it will be available. I'm almost certain that you will not load that server only with your LLM if is for local/family use. So you will have plenty of resources for your other workloads. Exemple, is not likely that you will be talking to your LLM while you are watching a movie in Plex.\n\nSynology are not that great for apps. They work there but Synology hardware are really limited. In things like Plex/Jellyfin the difference will be night and day.\n\nAnd is a great way to learn as well.\n\nBest of luck with your setup. I hope you have so much fun with with as I have with mine.",

      "text": "A few days ago I released an MCP server for this (works with Cursor, Codex, etc.). Claude just launched their Skills system for Claude, so I rebuilt it as a native skill with an even simpler setup. **(Works only in local Claude code!)**\n\n**Why I built this**: I was getting tired of the copy-paste between NotebookLM and my editor. NotebookLM (Gemini) has the major advantage that it only responds based on the documentation you upload; if something cannot be found in the information base, it doesn't respond. No hallucinations, just grounded information with citations.\n\nBut switching between the browser and Claude Code constantly was annoying. So I built this skill that enables Claude to ask NotebookLM questions directly while writing code.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill)\n\n**Installation**:\n\n    cd ~/.claude/skills\n    git clone https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-skill notebooklm\n\nThat's it. Open Claude Code and say \"What are my skills?\" - it auto-installs dependencies on first use.\n\n**Simple usage**:\n\n1. Say \"Set up NotebookLM authentication\" → Chrome window opens → log in with Google (use a disposable account if you want—never trust the internet!)\n2. Go to notebooklm.google.com → create notebook with your docs (PDFs, websites, markdown, etc.) → share it\n3. Tell Claude: \"I'm building with \\[library\\]. Here's my NotebookLM: \\[link\\]\"\n\nClaude now asks NotebookLM whatever it needs, building expertise before writing code.\n\n**Real example**: n8n is currently still so \"new\" that Claude often hallucinates nodes and functions. I downloaded the complete n8n documentation (\\~1200 markdown files), had Claude merge them into 50 files, uploaded to NotebookLM, and told Claude: \"You don't really know your way around n8n, so you need to get informed! Build me a workflow for XY → here's the NotebookLM link.\"\n\nNow it's working really well. You can watch the AI-to-AI conversation:\n\n    Claude → \"How does Gmail integration work in n8n?\"\n    NotebookLM → \"Use Gmail Trigger with polling, or Gmail node with Get Many...\"\n    \n    Claude → \"How to decode base64 email body?\"\n    NotebookLM → \"Body is base64url encoded in payload.parts, use Function node...\"\n    \n    Claude → \"What about error handling if the API fails?\"\n    NotebookLM → \"Use Error Trigger node with Continue On Fail enabled...\"\n    \n    Claude → ✅ \"Here's your complete workflow JSON...\"\n\nPerfect workflow on first try. No debugging hallucinated APIs.\n\n**Other Example:**\n\n[My workshop manual into NotebookLM \\> Claude ask the question](https://preview.redd.it/xuxggzcoe0wf1.png?width=2425&format=png&auto=webp&s=880ba6edab6023d47e81d34850579a3105e18680)\n\n**Why NotebookLM instead of just feeding docs to Claude?**\n\n|Method|Token Cost|Hallucinations|Result|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Feed docs to Claude|Very high (multiple file reads)|Yes - fills gaps|Debugging hallucinated APIs|\n|Web research|Medium|High|Outdated/unreliable info|\n|NotebookLM Skill|\\~3k tokens|Zero - refuses if unknown|Working code first try|\n\nNotebookLM isn't just retrieval - Gemini has already read and understood ALL your docs. It provides intelligent, contextual answers and refuses to answer if information isn't in the docs.\n\n**Important**: This only works with local Claude Code installations, not the web UI (sandbox restrictions). But if you're running Claude Code locally, it's literally just a git clone away.\n\nBuilt this for myself but figured others might be tired of the copy-paste too. Questions welcome!\n\n**For MCP users**: I also have an MCP server version that works with Cursor, Codex, etc.: [https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/notebooklm-mcp)",

      "text": "After watching another client spend $80k on an AI agent they shut down three months later, I need to say this out loud.\n\nThe vendors wont tell you this. Your CTO who just came back from a conference definitely wont tell you this. But someone needs to.\n\nMost companies have no business building an AI agent right now. Like zero business. And the data backs this up, Gartner says 40% of these projects will be straight up cancelled by 2027. Another study found that 95% of enterprise AI projects fail to deliver the ROI anyone expected.​\n\nThats not because the technology sucks. Its because everyone's building the wrong thing at the wrong time for the wrong reasons.\n\n# Here's my framework for when to say no\n\nYour transaction volume is too low - \n\nIf youre handling under 500 support tickets a month, you dont need a $50k AI agent. You need better documentation and maybe one more person. I had a client obsessing over automating their customer service when they were getting 200 tickets monthly. The math didnt math. Even if the agent worked perfectly, theyd save maybe 40 hours a month. Thats not worth the headache of maintaining an unpredictable system.​\n\nYour data is a mess - \n\nThis is the big one. Only few of the companies have data thats actually clean enough for AI. If your customer info lives in three different systems, your product docs are outdated PDFs scattered across Google Drive, and Susan from sales keeps the real pricing in a personal spreadsheet, youre not ready. Your agent will just hallucinate confidently wrong answers.​\n\nIve seen this kill more projects than anything else. The agent works great in the demo with clean test data. Then it goes live and starts telling customers about products you discontinued in 2022.\n\nYou cant explain what success looks like - \n\nIf you cant write down a specific number that will improve and by how much, youre building because of FOMO not strategy. \"We want to be innovative\" isnt a use case. \"We need to reduce our average support response time from 4 hours to 30 minutes\" is a use case.​\n\nMost projects I see start with \"we should do something with AI\" and then go find a problem to solve. Thats backwards.​\n\nThe task takes 30 minutes per week - \n\nSeriously. Some things dont need automation. I watched a startup spend two months building an agent to automate a weekly report that took their intern half an hour to compile. The agent needed constant tweaking and broke every time their data schema changed slightly. The intern would have been faster and more reliable.​\n\nYou have no one to own it - \n\nAI agents arent set and forget. They need constant monitoring, tweaking, and updating. If you dont have someone technical who can debug weird behavior and tune prompts, your agent will slowly get worse over time until people just stop using it.​\n\n# The uncomfortable truth - \n\nThe companies making AI agents work have boring advantages. They have clean data pipelines. They have clear metrics. They have technical teams who can maintain these things. They started with simple, well defined problems.​\n\nIf you dont have those things, you need to build that foundation first. Its not sexy. Nobody writes LinkedIn posts about \"we spent six months cleaning our data warehouse.\" But thats what actually works.\n\nThe best decision you can make might be deciding not to build an agent right now. Fix your data. Document your processes. Get clear on what success actually looks like. Then come back to this.",

We don't call that agentic use an \"agent\". It is a crap ton of math in deterministic scripts, with scheduled agentic actions where needed. Each AI agent does very little in the enterprise schema, but they are critical. \n\nCould one of you kind folk please describe an agent worth $50k/mo as a single agent? What am I missing here?

Here's the thing there's spending money on R&D and experiments, which is fine. Then there's lighting cash on fire because you skipped the basics. My post is about the second one.\n\nLike, if you're trying to build on a foundation that doesn't exist (messy data, no clear metrics, tiny volume), you're gonna fail. That's not exploration that's just ignoring reality. A good consultant tells you not to waste your money upfront, not takes the check and watches you crash.\n\nYeah, providers aren't responsible for bad client decisions. But someone in the room should be honest enough to say this won't work for you instead of just taking the money. That's what I'm trying to do here.\n\nAppreciate you actually asking this!",

Chatgpt a half sales pitch half job request email and send it to preferbly the owner of the business. They actually have a profit motive to hire talent. Send email then follow with a call. Hit em with your pitch and include your relavent experince and ability to execute on a level unmatched by the rest of their team proven by income through your own business. Be a \"disruptor.\" Use hackenyed business non-fiction phrases like that in your pitch. Think Sun tzu, 7 habits, getting to yes, Kizen etc that will be relatable. If they then ask for a resume afterwards use your one kernel of relevant experience and make up some awesome sounding bullshit from businesses that you worked for that are now sold/bankrupt. (check venture cap failure rates and business succes rates to know how large a pool this is to play in.) Have your one good reference from the job and then two professional sounding friends confirm your bullshit. Its not flawless but damn is it effective. Way better success rate then the path set out for the chimps. I can usually get a above avg salary in my desired field in 3-4 calls. Don't really have to do it often as I can back up my bs with talent in the field and will do my own research to fill in any holes I have.

Your brain isn't lazy, just right now scrolling wins because the pain of starting feels bigger than the pain of not doing it.\n\nUnder the hood your prefrontal cortex (planning, decisions) is getting overpowered by your limbic system (immediate comfort) and it's not a character flaw, it's a neuroscience problem with a neuroscience solution.\n\nHere is what I might recommend: stop trying to find motivation before you start and instead flip the order.\n\nThe motivation you're waiting for (dopamine release) is contingent on action initiation so your brain releases the \"motivation feeling\" AFTER you start moving, not before.\n\nTry this for one task: set a timer for 10 minutes. The goal is not to finish the task, just to start. Your only job is to be \"in motion\" on the task for 10 minutes and just do what you can on it . After that, you can quit guilt-free.\n\nWhat you might notice is that around 2-3 minutes in, your prefrontal cortex takes over and the resistance drops. Not always, but often enough that your brain starts learning \"hey this isn't as bad as I thought it would be.\"\n\nThe app might help by adding external structure (accountability, gamification) which definitely helps but apps sometimes work best when you understand the mechanism underneath - your brain needs proof that starting doesn't equal disaster. I think you might find more value in a 10-minute session of evidence than a thousand motivational quotes.\n\nTo circle back, the scrolling isn't the problem, it's just a symptom. Your brain is avoiding the predicted pain of starting. Give it one small proof that starting is survivable, then another, then another.\n\nGood luck and if you try it and think about, update your post with how you feel afterwards. It would be interesting to see how it works for you and maybe others would find value in the shared experiment!",

Action gives delayed reward. That’s why your brain keeps picking the quick hit.\n\nThe fix isn’t to just do it. It’s to make the first step so small it’s impossible not to do. Open the tab. Write one line. Take one note.\n\nOnce momentum starts, resistance dies. You don’t beat procrastination with motivation. You beat it with movement.\n\nThe moment you start doing anything, your brain switches from avoidance to engagement. That’s where everything changes.",

There's lots with background music or rain sounds, etc., and there's lots without music too. \n\n  \nThere's also a few browser wallpaper + timer/stopwatch websites (I like WonderSpace, though they use AI art, but it's helpful as a productivity tool still). Even setting a timer that's like 20 minutes and promising yourself that you're going to stay focused for the full 20 minutes is helpful. I really like their 25 minute pomodoro timer because dedicating 25 minutes isn't a lot of time, so often just 25 minutes dedicated to studying turns into an hour easy.\n\n  \nSome discord study servers will have study voice chats where everyone is muted and people have their webcams on while they study. This helps me feel less lonely if I'm studying by myself and if I turn my webcam on (you don't have to show your face just like your table or something) it helps me stay on task 'cus people might be watching me!\n\n  \nAlso, sometimes just taking out a piece of paper or a notebook and hand-writing what you're stressed about will help. Why are you procrastinating? What are you stressed about?\n\nWrite down little chunks of what you need to do. Do those small chunks one at a time. If you have 20 homework problems you need to complete, telling yourself you'll try to get just 3 of those problems done in an hour will let you feel less stressed about starting, and getting 3 problems done in an hour is much better than getting 0 problems done in an hour.\n\nIf you have to write something, like an email or an essay, just word vomit at first. Write whatever you can think of. Don't worry about it being refined and polished yet. \n\n  \nI hope some of these help you and good luck! I have struggled with procrastination a lot too, but these things all help me when I'm feeling meh and find myself procrastinating homework and stuff.",

It’s not about willpower; it’s about reducing the friction to start. \n\n The problem isn't the app you use; it's the size of the first step. When you feel blocked, your system is failing you, not your discipline. Here’s a simple system that works better than any app I’ve tested (and it’s free): \n\n 1. The 2-Minute Rule (Friction Reduction): If a task can be started in less than two minutes (e.g., opening the book, writing the first sentence of the email), do it immediately. This builds momentum. \n\n 2. Task Dismantling (The Slicing Hack): Your brain sees \"Write Report\" and freezes. Break it down into tiny, almost ridiculous steps: \"Open Word file.\" \\\\rightarrow \"Write Title.\" \\\\rightarrow \"Write one bullet point.\" You can't procrastinate on a 30-second task. \n\n 3. External Accountability: Apps are good, but a human is better. Tell one friend or family member exactly what you are going to finish by 6 PM today. The embarrassment of failing them is a stronger motivator than any streak badge. \n\n Apps like 'Forge' are cool, but the core issue is the start. Master the 2-Minute Rule first. I have a 1-page PDF guide on how I personally combine the 2-Minute Rule with time-blocking using a simple calendar app. DM me 'START GUIDE' if you want it.",

      "text": "\nWhen I first started buying companies, I didn’t have investors, fancy financing, or any kind of silver spoon. What I did have was time, curiosity, and a willingness to talk to business owners who wanted to retire. Over time I figured out that most people selling good companies don’t care about finding the highest bidder. They care about finding someone who will take care of what they built. That shift in thinking is what made everything possible.\n\nHere’s what I’ve learned from actually buying businesses with limited capital in 2025.\n\nI look for companies that are simple and steady. No hype. No startups(unless we think we can make something work with the existing owner staying on full time). I like plumbing, concrete, restoration, logistics, small manufacturing, marketing agencies with retainers, and local service companies that people rely on every week. They’re not glamorous, but they make consistent money and they’ve usually been run by the same person for twenty or thirty years. Those owners are tired. They want to slow down, but they also want to know their employees and customers will be taken care of.\n\nI build my own list. I pick an industry, use Google Maps, and write down every company that looks active. Then I just reach out. I’ll call or email the owner and say something like, “Hey, I’ve followed your business for a while and really respect what you’ve built. I own and operate a couple small companies and was wondering if you’ve ever thought about stepping back or bringing someone on to help with the next stage.” That’s it. No big sales pitch. Just a human conversation.\n\nMost people say no the first time and second time. Some never call back. But a few will talk. And those few conversations are where all the good deals come from. I keep track of everyone I contact and follow up every few months. Timing is everything.\n\nOnce a conversation turns serious, structure matters more than anything. I’ve used seller financing in nearly every deal I’ve done. One deal went like this: $1 million purchase price, $100k down, $500k SBA loan, and the seller carried $400k at five percent interest for five years. They liked the idea of getting paid over time instead of walking away. It gave me enough breathing room to run the business right.\n\nIf I don’t have the down payment, I find a partner who’s comfortable lending it in exchange for interest or a small profit share. I keep control by structuring it as a loan, not equity. That kind of creativity gets deals done without losing ownership. That said I always want an active partner. No passive guys - not worth the headache. \n\nI always talk to banks before I need them. I’ll call local SBA lenders and ask what they like to see from borrowers. They’ll tell you exactly how they think. That’s free education. When you finally bring them a real opportunity, you already know how to package it so they can say yes. Also keep in mind some of the local banks aren’t really SBA. \n\nDue diligence is where most buyers get lazy. I don’t. I ask for tax returns, bank statements, vendor lists, customer breakdowns, and payroll reports. I compare deposits to income. I verify that employees are real and staying on. I want no surprises after closing.\n\nWhen I negotiate, I care more about structure than price. I’ll ask for a few months of interest-only payments or a transition period where the seller helps part-time. Those little details protect cash flow while you learn. Sellers usually say yes because it helps everyone succeed.\n\nIf you want to get started, here’s what I’d do right now.\n\nWeek 1: pick one or two industries you understand. Build a list of 25 businesses in your area.\nWeek 2: call or email 10 owners. Get two real conversations.\nWeek 3: ask one of them for basic financials. Build a rough deal model just to practice.\nWeek 4: talk to one SBA lender and ask what it would take to fund a deal like that.\n\nThen repeat the cycle every month. If you stay consistent for 90 days, you’ll have real leads, real numbers, and one or two sellers who are thinking about it.\n\nBuying a business with limited capital isn’t magic. It’s process, patience, and communication. The 2025 market is full of retiring owners who want someone capable to take over. If you can listen, plan, and follow through, you can become that person.\n\nIf anyone wants to talk through how to start, how to reach out to sellers, or what to look for in a deal, drop your questions. I’m happy to share what’s worked for me.\n\nDr Connor Robertson",

These are saved as an md file (.claude/agents/agentname.md)... these agents can use mcp tools. \n\nThe zen mcp server is one of these tools. And what this tool does is send out api calls to other llms. Meaning if you set up one of these agent md files to use the zen mcp server it can send calls to get another llm and have that llm do things.\n\nI don't use this too much but it works. It's been more of an experimental thing. Built one agent that would search the web on any given topic then send out api calls to briefly discuss what it found with gemeni.. worked great was a bit overkill though. I also have a subagent that reviews python scripts that will run the scripts by Gemini as a second opinion. \n\nI'm also using claude code sessions like subagents though... so I have a main claude code session that launches other claude code sessions it creates context for (with subagents to help it do that)... then those sessions launch with a custom /command and do their thing using subagents themselves. I haven't come across much actual need to add an additional layer to that lol but it has worked where I have set it up for testing it out. As an added bonus the zen mcp agent can maintain a context window throughout the session which is something claude code agents can't.",

It really raises questions about the future of leadership and decision-making in organizations. \n\n\n\nWhile AI can analyze data and optimize processes with incredible efficiency, I wonder how it would handle the more nuanced aspects of leadership—like inspiring a team, fostering company culture, or navigating complex human emotions. After all, the most effective leaders often rely on empathy, intuition, and interpersonal skills, which are challenging for AI to replicate.\n\n\n\nThat said, integrating AI into decision-making processes could certainly enhance strategic planning and data-driven insights. It could allow human leaders to focus more on the creative and relational aspects of their roles. Do you think we might find a balance where AI supports CEOs rather than completely replaces them? It would be fascinating to hear your thoughts on how we can harness AI's potential while preserving the human touch in leadership!",

          "text": "You’re treating the symptom, not the cause. Sure, it can “work” sometimes, for some people. But forcing yourself to do things you hate is self-abuse. You don’t want to be your own slave. That’s school conditioning: break your will, do as told. The move isn’t more force; it’s dropping resistance and finding your why.\n\n\n\nStart with two questions:\n\n\n\nWhy do you want to be an entrepreneur at all?\nWhy are you procrastinating?\n\n\n\n\nOn procrastination: most people aren’t “lazy,” they’re scared.\n\nScared to do the thing -> scared to fail -> can’t tolerate the feelings -> harsh self-judgment -> ego fused to outcomes.\n\n“If I succeed, I’m worthy. If I fail, I’m worthless.”\n\nNow the stakes feel life or death. If you’re not sure you can nail it, you delay. Makes sense.\n\n\n\nOn motivation: extrinsic vs. intrinsic.\n\n\n\nExtrinsic: money, status, toys, pu**y.\nIntrinsic: solving your own problem, following genuine curiosity, doing work you actually find interesting.\n\n\n\n\nExtrinsic isn’t evil; it just needs to align with intrinsic. If you like the work and you want to impress women, cool, your true self and monkey brain point in the same direction. But if you don’t like the work, it bores you, and you’re only in it for money or fame, you’ll burn out and feel miserable.\n\n\n\nThe fix: choose an intrinsic why. Yes, choose. It rarely drops out of the sky. Decide what’s interesting enough to suffer for. When you have that, you have purpose. Humans need purpose. That’s why we go searching for meaning (religion, philosophies, whatever).\n\n\n\nAnd purpose isn’t about job title; it’s a lens.\n\n\n\nPlumber: “Gross job” vs. “I keep a city running, people rely on me, that feels good.”\nBurger joint: “I’m too good for this” vs. “I try to make every burger as perfect as possible, I like working with my hands, I love the look on people’s faces when they taste food made with care.”\nSame reality, different story. The story lives in your head.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the depression piece: if it started with the business, misaligned motivation can drain you. If it predates the business, odds are high it touches childhood trauma, which is also where those brutal standards come from. Money and status can numb “I’m not enough” for a minute, but they never fill the hole. Even at €100M, some people still feel like nothing. That’s early self-belief talking.\n\n\n\nWhat helps that? Years of therapy. In some places, legally and under clinical supervision, MDMA-assisted or psilocybin-assisted therapy can act like therapy on steroids, where legal and medically appropriate. Talk to a qualified professional and follow the law.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\n\n\n\nDetach your self-worth from outcomes.\nPick an intrinsic why you’re willing to suffer for.\nThen decide if entrepreneurship still makes sense, for your reasons, not Instagram’s.\n\n\nSource: Myself. Entrepreneur, childhood trauma, had depression my whole childhood, years of therapy and coaching ",

Burnt 40k+ USD of College Admins ( One of the Top Engineering Colleges) who trusted us. But end of the day zero revenue. We kept building DIY 3D printers , a mini GPU for AI Model Processing & Graphics Rendering , and IOT sensors and embedded engineering based products. Simple offer , use lab for free for 2 years as  startup accelerator and give us back 5 percent of the equity. \n\nPitched to 100 startup’s , offered free trials to all. Zero even enrolled.\n\nSecond one was a boring simple printing solution app on campus during exams. Our campus had an issue , during exams people needed to wait for 6-7 hours to get their notes printed , wait for 1-2 hours to go to stationary and also 6x price from normal stationary. We decided to solve this ( 2 peeps) , I built a quick Nocode app in 5 days and we launched in one week and one week to collaborate with one rider to deliver and one stationary guy to offer his printer setup ( we built one page app for him too ) , ugliest looking apps I ever built in my life. But boom we got 8k + USD revenues in 10-15 days and 50 percent pure profits. \n\nThan one same failed fancy complex AI sales app wrapper I built.\n\nThan boring tech agency ( freelancer initially just shifted to agency model last year ) which makes me money enough to financially fully independent under age of 25. ( though this differs for different people on their desires )  Pure hard grind for 4+ years non-stop 10-15 hours a day minimum. Worked with 40 + startup’s founders and learnt from their failures and successes. Just now started taking some time for gf and family. \n\nSo my take : \n\nInstead I will talk to people , observe where money flows , pick the boring paying problem , and yes building fancy one feature app is not boring difficult problem. \n\nAt max you are getting chance to talk to people and make relations, but at the end of the day all the boring paying problems with differentiated product and built with discipline leads to a better life. \n\nSee around yourself :) and list 10 people you know personally well ( you can basically sit with them and ask for 30-60 mins what they are doing in their life ) and list what they are doing, what’s the top of the mind problem to them , for what problems they pay heavily and you ask questions to them why they don’t pay to cheaper vendors ( get this homework done ). \n\nAnd ask yourself does that list matches you wanna build. And if no , than hunt and meet more people who are like them and keep doing u till you reach some peeps in tech who makes great cash flow money. You will be surprised :)",

The best software is a great company. Fun to work with, we jive with their people all pulling the same direction, their clients love them, and they are rapidly expanding. The rich company has been hiring a ton of people. Their culture is chaos. They have a tiny number of live clients (which begs the question why they got this much money). They constantly ask for stupid stuff, everyone working there is trying to make a name for themselves so there is no real direction, and they are just really difficult to work with.\n\nMoney is great, not gonna lie, but just because a company gets money does not mean they are going to win. It probably means you need to get on the fund raising and make this thing bigger though.

Invest into what drives revenue & growth, not crazy things like founder drops 200k on a car. Burn rate is important.\n\n2. Domain expertise is critical (don't have it, hire someone who does), don't build something you think someone will buy, back test and back test. Make sure someone is willing to pay for it. Just get a MVP (Minimum Viable Product)\n\n3. Build processes early, this can be a major advantage vs a company flush with $$$. You can outperform a larger company that doesn't (trust me there are plenty out there and may look great on the surface, behind the scenes a different story and part of it is they got a ton of money and can spin a story and window dress)\n\n4. Understand you're competition (top 1-3)-strengths/weakness. Your biggest competition plain and simple is status quo (I can't stress that enough)\n\n5. Find your niche, try to do it better than your competition, support is so important.\n\n6.Niche example at MVP we could compete against huge software companies (our product was on point), our sweet spot was 25-50k deals. The big players didn't care. We had 400-500k ARR clients (Bank of America was one, land and expand account). We couldn't compete for those deals because the big players noticed and cared.\n\nWe had internal processes in place. When we we acquired, the company was amazed and told us they had never acquired a company so well run for the size. \nA Billion and half dollar company that acquired 2-3 companies annually. \n\nWe had 2 people in marketing, no SDR/BDR's, no account managers, used Sales Nav and leadlander(website IP tracking app for impressions) and a CRM. \n\nWe were 100% self supported, cradle to grave. 24/7 support, internal professional services, etc\n\nLean and mean 100% bootstrapped 350k to start and slow built the company. We had several million in the bank all the time for liquidity if something went sideways. It did once, we did a version release that broke customer installs and didn't work. We couldn't sell it for 4-6 months (lost deal after deal)\n \n\nWhat is your plan, ours was never to be this massive scaled unicorn. I still converse with the former owner, he started another company, consults on startups. His worth between 20-30 million. Best place I could have got experience in software. I learned so much and our product was so complex and technical. We were easier to use, less expensive, built a bunch of integrations, only add features that could scale across our customer base. \n\nWe aggregated asks into the roadmap if it could scale across clients. Or we gave the option we will build it if they paidfor it. One big company did for a certain integration, paid us 150k in dev costs. \n\nAI at present is a tool and gets overstated. Vibe coding is impressive but no one really addresses the 360 of infrastructure requirements around it. When it breaks, support, security, backend, data, etc. We're getting their but lots and lots of heavy lifting is needed. Way too much to unpack around it.\n\nGeneral AI is the Holy Grail what we have is basically ML and narrow AI and non-consensus on Gen AI.",

For some people it is. \n\nI often think about my childhood snd teen years when I had so much time that I would actually get bored even though I had hobbies. I was also not aware of the world economy until I was about 14 when my parents started feeling it in the 80s.\n\nFor me, and I know a lot of people the 90s were pretty good. The economy was fairly stable and there wasn’t much of a cost of living increase versus today \n\nAnd also today we are blasted with negative news from all directions. The cost of living just keeps going up and it is now affecting people in the middle class. \n\nMany of us can’t get by on just one job anymore. I have a side gig, but I’m really tired of doing it so between that and my regular job I sometimes work 70 hours a week. I’m a careful spender and wise investor so I have that going for me. \n\nBut it’s hard to feel good about the future …..when the future doesn’t look so bright.",

      "text": "My wife works at a small private equity fund, pivoted to trading US stocks about a year ago.\n\nUsually, she has to dig through research reports and calculating indicators until midnight. As a data SWE, I'd tried to help her out, with some scripts to scrape data and plotting charts. But that could just relief a bit, and my entire weekend was always gone, and both of us were completely burned out.\n\nThis went on until Google released the Gemini CLI. I first used it for my own coding project, and suddenly it hit me: If this thing can architect and build up sophisticated engineering project so efficiently, why not build an automated investment research system for her? So, I had some free time during the these days, put all stuff together, and discovered it was surprisingly simple and useful.\n\nAfter finishing it, I had an epiphany. And I named it as 'vibe trading' system. 😃.  Now, she relies on this system, offloading most of her work to the Gemini CLI. She just has to ask questions and provide research ideas / direction. Review and revise the research report.  No more overtime. It feels absolutely amazing.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/561xemol01wf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6830472bd190066e11b570d94f24ce84b4feb7f0\n\nBasically, the idea behind that is simple, regarding investment research as data engineering and data analysis. Adapt the investment concepts into software engineering. Then core comes down to three simple, direct, and effective points:\n\n**Core Tool: Using the (free) Gemini CLI as the main AI powerhouse.** My wife doesn't need to learn complex commands; she just types instructions as if she's chatting.\n\nPreviously, she'd have over a dozen apps open—pulling financial reports, calculating MACD, pasting text into ChatGPT. All that switching was a massive time sink. Now, she just directs the AI from the CLI to do all the work, from research to writing the report. The time spent on data collection alone was cut in half.\n\n**Data Accessing: Find a reliable stock data MCP to be the \"Intelligence Hub.\"** This step is absolutely critical, just like picking a solid database for a project. **BTW, setting up the necessary post-processing is also important specially when your data source is meaningless daily prices.**\n\nI used to use [https://polygon.io/](https://polygon.io/) 's MCP for data source. But it doesn't work well. The token consuming was scaring.\n\nAfter searching, I went with [https://plusefin.com](https://plusefin.com) service. As their website states, it has a massive amount of data. The key is that it also provides various LLM friendly digest, which saves a ton of effort on data post-processing and calculating indicators:\n\n* **Price Summaries:** Directly outputs summaries of past price trends, YTD price changes, and Sharpe ratios. Saves a ton of tokens compared to processing raw daily data.\n* **Technical Analysis Summaries:** Instead of just dumping dry MACD/RSI values, it gives direct conclusions, like, \"Long-term MA is trending up, but a short-term bearish divergence suggests a pullback.\" Ready to use.\n* **Machine Learning Predictions:** Calculates probabilities based on price and volume, e.g., \"65% probability of trading sideways or a slight dip in the next 5 days, range $67-$72.\" This essentially integrates the prediction models I used to have to write for her.\n* Multiple news and social media sources, very comprehensive.\n\nThat is exactly what i want.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e0kskzhn01wf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4803ac84929d98b82c61f966753bf10afc5bfe67\n\nAnother part is making a beautiful report, especially the **Data Visualization**. Nobody reads dry, text-only reports.\n\nEven though the final research report is just about buy/sell prices, it's much better to have visualizations during the analysis. It's more convincing and user-friendly. I tried a few solutions, and in the end just used Alibaba's AntV Chart MCP. The charts look great. And it can match Gemini-cli work flow well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rznsqpvo01wf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1899c6038d4d76cd5f8b77533c341d972405944\n\nAfter integrating every thing together, my wife no longer has to battle with raw data. Everything she receives is an actionable insight. Her efficiency has just skyrocketed.\n\nTake her recent research on Walmart as an example. The entire process takes just 3 minutes, which is infinitely faster than her old manual method. The steps are ridiculously simple:\n\n1. **Install Gemini CLI:** One `npm` command, no complex setup.\n2. **Connect Data Source:** Register at plusefin, get the MCP link, and use `gemini mcp add` to connect it.\n3. **Add Visualization:** I set up the Alibaba AntV Chart MCP. The charts look great, and she can use them directly in her presentations, saving her the trouble of drawing them.\n4. **Write the Prompt:** Once the MCPs are connected, run Gemini CLI in YOLO mode. One important note: just asking it to \"research Walmart\" produces a terrible report. But after I fed it a professional-grade prompt, the results were incredible (I'll share the prompt at the end).\n5. **Get Conclusions:** The system finished what used to be a full day's work in 3 minutes, spitting out a complete fundamental research report.\n6. **Follow-up Questions:** If she feels the report isn't good enough, she can just instruct the AI to revise it. It's very flexible\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6fgmhcq01wf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=6535d8e2c7da7b9e494b2468826a89d91bdfc67e\n\nAfter I deployed this system on her computer during the holiday, my wife basically treats me like a god. She's been vibe trading every day since and doesn't even dare let her boss know that her research reports are almost drafted by AI.\n\nIf you also have someone in finance at home who's battling with data all day, you should really give this a try: First, get the hang of Gemini CLI's basic usage (it's super fast for us devs), then hook it up to a few reliable MCP servers (like the plusefin.com and antv chart mcp I used). Once it's set up, your vibe trading system can run fast, and you'll free up your own time to do other things. Especially when you have a financial analyst wife 🐶.  It's an absolute game changer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/450zq8zr01wf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=214db097fc792163373547aea79297ca24951963\n\n  \n\n\nP.S. I uploaded the prompt and config files I mentioned. If you're interested, let's research this together. I feel like I could even get into actual quant trading with this.\n\n[https://github.com/wanghsinche/vibe-trading](https://github.com/wanghsinche/vibe-trading)",

How is a Skill different from projects?\n\nYou could make an email Skill to write like you, but you could also make a project that does the same.\n\nOr I have this project that is instructed \"If A, find X google drive document, if B, find Y. Heres the links\" - Could Skills replace this part of the prompt which could help with tokens?\n\nPlease explain like I'm 10 🙏🏼 ",

          "text": "Here's how Claude himself explained it, and I think he really captures the essence of it:\n\n**Claude Skills** solve a common problem: normally, when you want an LLM to do something specific, you have to prompt it each time. Or maybe you set up custom instructions in a project, but then you can only use those instructions when you're in that project. Otherwise, you're back to copying and pasting the same prompt over and over.\n\nSkills change this completely. Think of it like Neo's \"I know kung fu\" moment in *The Matrix*. Just like they uploaded kung fu directly into Neo's brain and he could instantly use it, you're uploading specialized knowledge into Claude that it can apply automatically whenever needed. When you create a Skill, you're building a knowledge package with instructions, best practices, examples, and specific guidance for a task. You download it, upload it back into Claude's Skills section, and you're done. From that point forward, whenever you mention anything relevant to that Skill (or even just start a task it applies to), Claude automatically uses that knowledge. It's like giving Claude a reference guide it checks before starting work.\n\nThe beauty is the \"anywhere, anytime, automatically\" part. You don't have to keep uploading prompts. You don't have to be in a specific project. It takes the concept of custom instructions and makes it universal across every single conversation you have. Skills just work in the background whenever they're relevant, no manual triggering needed. It's Claude's \"I know kung fu\" moment.",

Basically all you need is clear titles and headers for the LLM to parse. Of course, the better you are with words and articulating instructions, the better the experience. \n\nI upload the SPN at the beginning of a chat and prompt the LLM to use @[file name] as a system prompt and to use as a first source of reference. \n\nFor there, my prompts can be start and basic. What you're really building is an external memory file for the LLM. A project rulebook, employees handbook, Claude Skills, Google Playbooks or System Prompt Notebooks - all they are, are structured documents with instructions, rules, etc. \n\nWhere Google and Claude will fall short is they are developing platform specific tools. My SPNs are not platform specific and can be used with any LLM that accepts uploads. \n\nSo, if you've been doing to the same, you are ahead of they power curve.",

When used, skills make Claude better at specialized tasks like working with Excel or following your organization’s brand guidelines.\"\n\n\"There’s one extra detail that makes this a feature, not just a bunch of files on disk. At the start of a session Claude’s various harnesses can scan all available skill files and read a short explanation for each one from the frontmatter YAML in the Markdown file. This is very token efficient: each skill only takes up a few dozen extra tokens, with the full details only loaded in should the user request a task that the skill can help solve.\"\n\n\"Over time the limitations of MCP have started to emerge. The most significant is in terms of token usage: GitHub’s official MCP on its own famously consumes tens of thousands of tokens of context, and once you’ve added a few more to that there’s precious little space left for the LLM to actually do useful work.\"\n\n\"One of the most exciting things about Skills is how easy they are to share. I expect many skills will be implemented as a single file—more sophisticated ones will be a folder with a few more.\"\n\n\"You can grab a skills folder right now, point Codex CLI or Gemini CLI at it and say “read pdf/SKILL.md and then create me a PDF describing this project” and it will work, despite those tools and models having no baked in knowledge of the skills system.\"",

I'm going to talk about a specific situation but this has come up multiple times in my career so far in different ways. How can you influence/persuade higher ups/your manager to follow your lead in your area of expertise?\n\nI recently completed a project on a specific domain over \\~3 months for a client of the company's, manager made some light suggestions (he's trying to push a new framework he likes) which could be useful in the future, but the problems I ended up working on for this project were different. Whenever the project's future comes up (we will have a follow on contract) he confidently says we'll be solving the problem with the new framework which misses the actual problems that need to be solved. I think its a bit of an ego thing/wanting to provide heading and his focus being split so not really understanding what's on the project (I have given 2 weekly reviews to the customer and him). How can I persuade him that our problems are not solved by this new framework? Especially when this is said in the middle of stand-up with the rest of the team or something I don't feel like I shouldn't call him out etc. as he's the \"one in charge\"....\n\nKeen to know how you'd handle this - this must be a classic problem, thanks in advance",

          "text": "Ah this is a good one. It's good to see a decent r/ExperiencedDevs question once in a while. Here's my take:\n\n\n\nWhen your manager tells you to do something, quiet resistance is one of the worst ways you can handle this. Even if you are eventually right, you'll be seen as insubordinate, which will reduce your credibility. I don't know if that's you what you did, but I've seen many seniors (both managers and ICs) fall into this trap so I think it's good to call out.\n\nWe are expected to know/learn about the new things outside of our immediate scope like a different framework in your instance. You have a a few things to understand in your environment:\n\n* Where is this coming from? Did your manager read an article and got excited about a new tech? Or is it a company wide push?\n* Does your manager have the expertise to evaluate a new framework and has he done so?\n* Is the new framework actually better? Is there a long-term benefit for adopting it? This could be runtime performance, developer productivity, security, or consolidation into a single framework.\n* Is it just new and shiny? Any framework that's not battle tested for years is not something I would use in a serious project. Choose boring tech.\n* Is there anyone in your company that's using it? Have you talked to them?\n\n  \nOnce you better understand where he's coming from, you can follow some steps like:\n\n* Talk to him to understand why he thinks the new framework is superior.\n* Offer to write up a feasibility report with a POC/dummy project or low priority/low urgency project.\n* Do the 1-2 page report, include highlights, lowlights, learning curve, work needed to migrate, others' experiences with the framework etc.\n\nIf you do this, you both will have concrete evidence about the new framework and whether it is feasible to use or not or under which circumstances it would be useful. \n\nThis will give you more credibility that: you have taken a recommendation from your manager seriously, you chose a low-risk method to evaluate this recommendation, you provided concrete evidence with a report that others can reference. And in case your hand is forced despite a negative recommendation (if you end up writing a negative one), you will have documented this.\n\nThis also gives your manager, who has publicly committed to using the framework, evidence that he started the work he said would with an assessment so he's not going back on his word. The document can be used to justify his decision either way.",

This scenario is so common in dysfunctional organizations, which I worked at for 7 years unfortunately, that it's worth occasionally practicing your line in front of a mirror before standups so you're ready for the ambush.\n\nOnly dysfunctional organizations make trapdoor decisions like architecture and frameworks in such an ad hoc, flippant way.",

Make sure adding the new framework is accounted for alongside all the feature needs and any other high priority tech debt. You may end up seeing that there’s room to do it and it could be a good learning opportunity for a new tool for your resume. Or your manager may end up seeing that you’ll be stretched too thin, and however excited about the framework!this project might not be the right fit.

Sometimes these people won’t even take the time to understand completely and they’ll just trust me.\n\nIf I’m dealing with the wrong person, it doesn’t matter what I say or how I say it. Their mind is made up. They bullshit you by acting like they know what you’re saying but they don’t understand it at all, or they just plain don’t care. \n\nPeople will lie to you and not tell you all the information. Sometimes that’s for your benefit, sometimes it isn’t. Sometimes you learn this later. \n\nMeanwhile, instead of building the best product, we’re over here talking about how to best manipulate and bullshit each other. \n\nYou should be able to just say what you think. Bullshit wastes time. It creates a culture of bullshitting each other. If the best move at your organization is to blow smoke or to try to manipulate them to get them to see reason, you should know the kind of organization you’re working for: One that produces bullshit. It doesn’t care about the right answer for customers or the product or the company. They accept a shit product or they’re incapable of realizing what a shit product is. You are powerless to stop that. At the end of the day, it’s not your company. \n\nIf this is where you find yourself to this you’re either going to look for the culture you thought you were in and wanted to be, where you would fit naturally, or stay where you are and do what you’re told and spend more time in the garden, or become like them and become a professional bullshitter. \n\nI hope you can have honest conversations with your superiors, that they care that you give a shit, that they listen and change their mind when you have the right solution, and that you’re able to change yours when they do. It shouldn’t need a 2 page memo. Just talk to them.",

As soon as I read \"new framework he likes\" I instantly thought of [cargo cults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_programming).\n\nThe term is based off of the post-WWII event of villagers on remote islands of the Pacific building fake airports, landing strips, control towers, using wooden headphones, lighting fire signals, marching, and carrying out rituals in hope that cargo planes would land and give them supplies and aid.\n\nObviously the decision to send financial aid to a country depends on much more than that; the villagers were carrying out an empty ritual under the direction of colonial rule and the faction in charge. Imagine being directed to carve wooden headphones after you've just gone through WW2 and everyone is struggling to eat.\n\nUnfortunately, unless you had experience in postcolonial diplomacy and civil engineering, your argument would probably be up against the odds. Worse, it might even get you labeled as a naysayer and get you hammered back into line. Most people end up continuing the roleplay, solving their immediate needs when the mask is off, and disillusionment of the cult settles in when planes never land on the scheduled date. In your case, this might be the date of the contract renewal.\n\nHope that shines some light. In your case you probably want to politely bring up the problems in your reviews, document these reviews to CYA, ensure your immediate needs are handled (health, wealth, happiness), and continue your rituals until questions begin to arise.",

To have your ideas implemented, you have to have good ideas, good relationships with your peers, and be table to execute effectively. I'd start by exploring your managers reasons for choosing this, using open questions and looping and try your best to understand their perspective. This at least will remove any suggestion that you don't understand. Take a look at who else in your network you can lean on and any relationships you can improve.

The PR proposes using a single string with template syntax to determine which columns to show; my preference would be to just use a list of booleans as it's more clear. \n\nI suggested this, and the person who raised the PR replied with a GenAI generated comment weighing up the pros and cons of each, then updated the PR to do *both* which I feel is unnecessary and makes it more messy and sufficient to understand. \n\nHow do people go about dealing with stuff like this? If this was at work, and the PR came from someone who works for me, I would just have a chat and ultimately would have the power to make a final decision. Ultimately I can decide whether or not to merge this, but it feels different with volunteers. I don't want to seem a dick, but I also don't want to merge some garbage, and then have this in my name on my public GitHub.\n\nAny thoughts/advice? Both about this, but also in the general case?",

      "text": "I have 7 YOE in a few early, mid, and late stage startups. I’ve been working at a well funded, tech-adjacent startup for a few months. Fully remote, senior title, \\~$200k. The engineering team is 30 people, which is small relative to the rest of the company. The interview vibes were okay, not perfect, but I took the job because it seemed like the most stable, non-chaotic option.\n\nWhat I got instead:\n\n* PMs want everything to move faster but are too busy to write feature specs.\n* No estimates, and usually no issue tracking at all. If someone mentions a bug, people either fix it right then or it gets forgotten about. There’s no backlog being reviewed with the team.\n* Engineers are individually pretty good, but I rarely hear about people working together on anything. Feels like engineers are judged directly by leadership based on feature output and visibility. Almost everyone is a “senior” IC.\n* CTO believes handwritten code is a relic of the past and you should use agents for everything. One agent is not enough, you need to have multiple copies of the repo with multiple agents running in the background. Otherwise you’re wasting time when you could be producing more code. Which, fine, I understand the management perspective and I can entertain the idea that this is the future, if it weren’t for…\n* Code reviews are very minimal because people don’t want to delay each other’s features. People don’t ask for advice in areas they don’t understand. Nobody cares if their approach is weird or hard to maintain, it’s the next person’s problem. So there is some slop.\n* Leadership occasionally makes vague sweeping statements like “it’s everyone’s responsibility to avoid slop,” but lack the time (and maybe the leadership skills) to actually incentivize people to do that. Or maybe it’s gaslighting, idk.\n* Leadership seems satisfied with this culture, and takes pride in how “productive” the team is. I think they perceive the team as “elite” because of how much they can get done as individuals without involving other people. The early employees have internalized this.\n\nNo meetings, no middle management, no bureaucracy, just build things. That's what everyone wants, right? But something about the way it’s executed here just feels off. It’s like collaboration is viewed as a burden that slows engineers down. They want all the benefits of collaboration but don’t value time spent collaborating. People will answer questions and give deeper reviews if asked, but when I ask for those things, I get this feeling that I’m wasting people’s time. They usually keep their interactions with each other brief. I can only imagine what the more junior people must feel like with impostor syndrome, and being fully remote.\n\nI feel dumb for picking this company but I keep telling myself it’s only temporary. I live in a city with lots of tech companies. I would take a pay cut to be in an office 10 hours a day with friendly and collaborative people (if those jobs still exist) instead of holed up in my apartment asking Claude to explain the 5 different weird homegrown ETL systems that were vibecoded by different people, and then race to build a 6th one before bedtime.\n\nI’m getting feedback that I should increase my output, which I understand, but I also want to avoid burnout. My goal was to stay for a few years and compartmentalize work from my personal time, but I’m not sure if I’ll be able to.\n\nHas anyone made a similar cultural shift? Have you built connections in a very individualistic company? What worked for you?",

For example we have a project structure we have many dependencies that we can call modules. If you update a module and it has 40 uses in the code base. In my eyes it's normal to test all 40 uses so the best person isn't left with a time bomb. But that's not what's encouraged where I work. People focus on their work and don't test the other 39 uses. So when you come along to do your work on use case 13, it may break. But that's your problem. The guy who didn't do the full job is cheered for while you spend time doing it right and are a drag.

Right now, we're using clunky scripts or RPA tools but the problem is they break every time the UI changes, and it's slow as hell. Plus, training non-tech staff to handle it is a nightmare.\n\nHas anyone found solid ways to describe tasks in plain text, then automate them reliably? Something that learns the steps, runs fast on any PC, and handles popups or surprises without falling apart? Looking for alternatives that are cheap and deterministic, especially for on-prem setups. What have you tried that actually works well? Open to any suggestions.",

How you can also go from 0 --> $10K --> $100K --> $1M ?\n\nHere’s a simple founder toolkit playbook to help you get your first 100 users without a marketing budget:\n\n**Launch even on Moon**\n\n* Launch on Product hunt\n* Post on Betalist\n* Launch on Peerlist\n* Share in \"Show HN\" on Hacker News\n* Launch on Uneed\n* Share in “Products” on Indie Hackers\n* Showcase on reddit\n* Submit to Product Hunt\n* Launch on Microlaunch\n* Get listed on 200+ directories like above ones\n\n**Build in Public on Twitter, Reddit, Linkedin, even on friends whatsapp group**\n\n* Show what you’re building with videos, screenshots and updates.\n* Post product updates, success and failures.\n* Ask for feedback on specific features, ask them to review and roast.\n* Share testimonials and case studies + learnings\n* Celebrate your wins and others wins\n* Follow 25-30 top accounts in your niche and engage with their posts\n\n**Become part of the Game**\n\n* Scan X, Linkedin and Reddit for relevant conversations, dont even leave facebook and discord.\n* Track competitor mentions, search for keywords, and intent words.\n* Track keywords related to the problem you solve, see google trends and searches.\n* Look for mentions of specific features\n* Get alerts for your product’s category\n* Contribute meaningfully, share your product and disclose your affiliation\n\n**Start SEO on day 0**\n\n* Write \\[competitor\\] alternative pages\n* Publish feature pages\n* Get listed on as many startup directories possible\n* Write \\[competitor\\] pricing pages\n* Create templates/examples galleries\n* Turn your FAQs into blog posts\n* Write \\[competitor\\] coupon/discount code pages\n\nIf all this sounds too much, I have also written my playbook [unicornmaking.com](http://unicornmaking.com/)\n\n which gives you everything from ideas, founders database + case studies, how to build, launch, grow, scale, sell + list of SEO things, directories, boilerplates etc. everything you need is here.\n\nSo, lets build donkeycorns now.",

I personally find the idea of working on my secondary passions which I could not pursue early in my life to be very intriguing. Some people already suggested taking a break, I agree with them, there’s a very nice lecture by a Harvard professor about the importance of letting yourself be bored, in the era of constant stimulation and dopamine from your devices.

When I was in highschool I was making minecraft mods, so I had an understanding of certain fundamentals going into learning C++.\n\nThe big hurdle I was dealing with with the whole BSP thing is most of the code examples I found or was shown were for super old versions of OpenGL, and I had to pick things apart through trial and error to understand why my engine was [rendering chaotic messes like this](https://imgur.com/a/5IS6hZE). And even when I was finally rendering the BSP, using Quake's collision system just wasn't clicking for the longest time, and even when it *was* thanks to examples provided by the people I mentioned above, I just couldn't get it working in my engine. It got to the point where I just started looking into Sphere->Triangle collision and converting the BSP faces into one big collision mesh, and then even with that I was stuck with issues like falling through the floor, clipping through walls, and what have you.",

I do not know why they haven't also kept up non-Docker releases but I can understand not wanting to bother with it anymore.\n\nThe main feature of the project is comparing SMART data with the data produced by BackBlaze, where they inferred statistically significant relations between various SMART values and HDD failure. To which they also add smartctl's own warning logic, so HDD unhealthy status can be marked from \"Scrutiny\" (BackBlaze data), or \"SMART\" (smartctl), or \"both\".\n\nI do wish there was better separation between the layers (data collection / storage / analysys / presentation) so that we could potentially build our own UI on top of the BackBlaze/smartctl logic.\n\nWhat I'm doing is first of all to keep using Scrutiny. I haven't seen any alternative project with these features. But do be warned that statistical correlation has its drawbacks too, for example I have a HDD with a slightly out of spec SMART attribute 3 (Spin-Up Time), which apparently gives it an 11% chance of failure according to BackBlaze.\n\nYou have to these things in stride. HDD management is a numbers game anyway. Always have one good HDD standing by ready to replace one that fails and that's it.\n\n> I’m aware you can set up something comparable manually with InfluxDB + Grafana, but it’s nowhere near as quick or easy to get running as Scrutiny.\n\nDepends on what you want to achieve. I don't use Grafana, just Influx. I have one Influx install that I use to collect data from both Scrutiny's collector and my own scripts. My scripts collect two pieces of data that Scrutiny doesn't (or does in a different way):\n\n* I take temperatures produced by the `drivetemp` kernel module on the host, which can be sampled as often as needed without waking up the HDDs. Scrutiny can also take temperatures but it does it via smartctl, who needs to wake up the drives to do it so I've restricted it to one sample per day. Temperatures can be important because they are not covered by the BackBlaze study, but there are drives that will start randomly reporting unusual temperatures in their old age (the sensor is probably going) and I'll take whatever warning signals I can get to keep an eye on an HDD.\n* I take HDD running/standby status from `hdparm -C`, which again doesn't wake up the drives.\n\nMy graphs are:\n\n* A temperature graph (with my samples, not Scrutiny's).\n* A running/standby two-step graph for each drive.\n* A graph of Command Timeout (SMART 188) values, which can be a warning for some Seagate drives (but can also warn about bad cables or bad connectors).\n* A graph of the [bad SMART values](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1o2gqqy/where_to_buy_nas_or_hdd_in_europe/niqijyr/) which should always be zero, this is a simple graph consisting of a single line (ideally) where I basically watch for any of these attributes from any of the drives jumping away from the zero line.",

                  "text": "> Does that smart collection wake up the drives?\n\nBy default yes. There's a smartctl option `-n standby` to make it collect only if the drive is not in standby. You can add either via env vars `COLLECTOR_COMMANDS_METRICS_{SCAN,INFO,SMART}_ARGS` or to commands endings in `_args` in `collector.yaml` (the ones with `--json` in them).\n\nThe problem is that the Scrutiny collector can't schedule different sets of commands at different times, one for temperature and one \nwithout. So if you add `-n standby` it will never collect if the drive is sleeping when it runs, so you will never get any readings, neither temperature nor other attributes.\n\nThat's why I prefer to simply run it once a day with wake-up and I'm assured of one set of readings per day.\n\n> is it enough then to just poll the smart data daily?\n\nGenerally yes. Temperature might be the only one that's worth collecting very often (I do 15 minutes). But please note that the situation I was talking about (temp sensor going crazy and showing >100C on some Seagate drives) is a constant condition so it would show up on the daily collection anyway.\n\nMost SMART attribute failures are gradual, and anyway it's very unlikely that you would catch a failure with only an hour or so in advance so what's the point. \n\nMy custom temperature collector script relies on the `drivetemp` kernel module being installed and loaded on host, and uses `/sys` paths to collect the temps without waking up the drives. You can also see the drive temps if you run `sensors` on the host but I don't want to have to do that from a docker container so I ended up adding `SYS_RAWIO` and `SYS_ADMIN` capabilities and parsing `/sys`... which may not necessarily be better.\n\nUnfortunately the resulting container is held together by spit and duct tape, it's highly dependent on my host environment (/dev paths and so on) and there's also a lot of string manipulation fuckery. I sincerely doubt it would work on another system otherwise I would've published it somewhere. I have to update it every time I add or remove a drive because it finds new ways to fail.\n\nFor me it was mostly an opportunity to learn about Influx graphing language and how to push data to Influx DB from a script, I can't say it has helped with the drives more than Scrutiny has.",

This may mean that companies are less flexible when it comes to adjusting their size up/down when they get traction/go through a rough patch. It also affect B2B clients who may not want to hire dedicated employees to implement and monitor a new piece of software (for example), as they have to keep them around if the implementation fails.",

                  "text": "errr hang on...  \nThere’s a lazy narrative that European venture capital is “risk-averse” because of some cultural mindset. I don’t think so. Europe’s model reflects **collective responsibility**, not fear of failure. It was built to avoid the catastrophic personal fallout that comes from treating workers as disposable.\n\nUnlike the US, Europe didn’t design its healthcare and labour systems in the shadow of **racialised inequities** that denied people of colour access to basic protections. The US model evolved under Jim Crow, tying healthcare to employment and embedding systemic exclusion. Europe chose a different path — one that values human dignity over hyper-flexible labour markets.\n\nThe claim that Europe is too fragmented to scale is also overstated. The EU is more unified today than the US was during its early growth phase, including the fragmentation of law across the various states. Yes, linguistic and legal diversity adds friction, but the single market, GDPR, and harmonised standards create a strong baseline for cross-border business.\n\nLabour protections aren’t a bug. They’re a feature. They slow down pivots, but they also prevent families from being ruined by the transient whims of capital. If European VCs want more unicorns, the answer isn’t to mimic Silicon Valley’s “move fast and break people” ethos. It’s to innovate within a framework that values people as stakeholders, not collateral damage.\n\nAnd before anyone frames this as some socialist ideal, let’s be clear: **China outperforms the US across multiple benchmarks — quality of living, technical innovation, and speed to market — while maintaining a very different social contract.** So the idea that only the US model works is a myth.\n\nThe real challenge isn’t cultural pessimism. It’s building capital markets and exit environments that match Europe’s social contract. That’s a harder conversation — but it’s the one worth having.",

Global leadership approved, but said I'd need to get the budget and work with each region separately... which looking back, was their way of getting me to deal with the pain of co-ordinating it all.\n\n- In the US, one person could sign off a six-figure deal, providing you were a registered supplier with a signed general services agreement. No haggling, to the point, signed off very quickly.\n- In APAC, there was one person in Sydney, although the price was just ~10% of the US deal as APAC really meant Australia + Singapore with a sprinkling from other countries. No BS, easy to deal with.\n- But in EMEA, I had to get buy-in and budget allocation from the heads of UK+IE, France, Benelux, DACH, Nordics and Southern Europe. They all had separate budgets, all wanted to haggle, all wanted a unique element for their market, all had different agendas, and some needed me to split their contract and spend across two different quarters. It was about 10X the work for a contract value about one-third lower than the US deal.",

This is for simple tasks that I can fully see and understand what is going wrong, Sonnet 4.5 just doesn't have a clue how to solve problems, which is what programming is all about. What it can do is write code exactly as you specify, which is basically not worth $2/mo since so can ChatGPT and probably other services, much less $200/mo.

When you're trying to brainstorm, research, or trace complex logic, the linear scroll format is a massive blocker—ideas get buried, and it’s impossible to track branches of thought.\n\nGraphite solves this by treating every chat as a dynamic, visual graph on an infinite canvas.\n\n# What it is\n\nGraphite is a desktop application built with Python (PyQt5) that integrates with your local LLMs via **Ollama**.\n\n* **Non-Linear Conversations:** Every prompt and response is a movable, selectable node. If you want to revisit a question from 20 steps ago, you click that node, and your new query creates a branching path, allowing you to explore tangents without losing the original context.\n* **Visual Workspace:** It's designed to be a workspace, not just a chat log. You can organize nodes into **Frames**, add **Notes** for external annotations, and drop **Navigation Pins** to bookmark key moments.\n* **Data Privacy:** Because it uses Ollama, all conversations and data processing stay local to your machine.\n\n# Key Features I’m Excited About\n\n1. **Chart Generation:** You can right-click any node containing structured data and ask the AI to generate a **bar chart, pie chart, or even a Sankey diagram** directly on your canvas using Matplotlib.\n2. **Takeaways & Explainers:** The context menu lets you instantly generate key summaries or simplified \"explain it like I'm five\" notes from a complex AI response.\n3. **Comprehensive Persistence:** It saves the entire workspace (nodes, connections, frames, notes, and pins) to a local SQLite database, managed via a \"Chat Library\" for session management.\n\nI'm currently using the qwen2.5:7b model, but it's designed to be model-agnostic as long as it runs on Ollama.\n\nI'm looking for feedback from the community, especially around the usability of the non-linear graph metaphor and any potential features you'd find useful for this kind of visual AI interaction.\n\n\n\n**Repo Link:** [https://github.com/dovvnloading/Graphite](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdovvnloading%2FGraphite)\n\nThanks for taking a look!",

      "text": "You’ve got a small growth team, less than $10K a month to spend on marketing, and you’re still under $1M ARR.\n\nForget the noise and read this first.\n\nI'm the founder of [this SAAS](https://gojiberry.ai) and this is the plan I am following every week.\n\nContent\n\n→ Find 10 founders crushing it in your niche\n\n→ Screenshot their 10 best posts each (100 posts in total)\n\n→ Extract hooks and topics with ChatGPT\n\n→ Post 6x per week on LinkedIn (4 general topics and 2 about your company)\n\n→ Repost your top-performing general post (by impressions) to 10 subreddits every week\n\n→ Post 3 tweets per week from your best LinkedIn content\n\n→ Create 1 YouTube video per week based on your top LinkedIn post\n\n→ Create 1 YouTube video per week on trending topics\n\n→ Create 1 YouTube video per week interviewing a successful customer\n\n→ Publish 1 article per week based on your best-performing post\n\n→ Have your team like, comment, and repost all your LinkedIn and Twitter content\n\nOutreach\n\n→ Use GojiberryAI to find high-intent leads and send personalized outreach on LinkedIn\n\n(track people engaging with competitors or specific keywords)\n\n→ Use as many LinkedIn accounts as your team allows ($99 per seat)\n\n→ For email, use InstantlyAI[ ](https://instantly.ai)with leads from GojiberryAI + Sales Navigator\n\n→ Send at least 500 emails per day to start seeing results\n\n→ Focus on quality over volume\n\nReferrals\n\n→ Use Tolt for your affiliate program\n\n→ Identify your clients getting the best results\n\n→ Turn them into use cases and testimonials\n\n→ Let affiliates share these use cases with their referral links\n\n→ Create an Affiliate Resources Hub so affiliates always have content to share\n\nFast Iteration Loops\n\n→ Build free tools to attract users and boost SEO (3 per month)\n\n→ Create lead magnets so good your clients want to share them (3 per month)\n\n→ Build one landing page per Reddit post to boost conversions (as often as possible)\n\n→ Pay small LinkedIn influencers to repost your best content\n\nEasy Wins\n\n→ List your SaaS on all AI and SaaS directories for traffic and SEO boosts\n\n→ Comment 5 times per day on high-performing LinkedIn posts with genuine value\n\n→ Track outreach responses in a CRM and follow up until you get a clear no\n\n→ Comment on high-ranking Reddit SEO posts 3 times per day for evergreen traffic\n\nWhat to Avoid\n\n→ Running paid ads\n\n→ Paying influencers more than $250 per post\n\n→ Using Clay (not useful at your stage)\n\n→ Ignoring your plan\n\nThe Truth :\n\nYou don’t need to chase fundraising rounds, startup awards, or fancy incubator badges.\n\nMost founders waste time chasing validation instead of traction.\n\nYou don’t need a million-dollar budget or a 10-person team. You need a system that works and the discipline to repeat it every day.\n\nOne focused person can reach €100K MRR with less than $10K per month in spend.\n\nThe goal isn’t to look successful. It’s to build something that compounds.\n\nSo tell me, are you chasing hype or building momentum?\n\nPS : i am NOT at $100k mrr yet. I'm just following this plan :)\n\nPPS : [here is a more detailled plan ](https://gojiberry.ai/10kmrr)",

      "text": "Looking for feedbacks :)\n\nAfter building and deploying 50+ GenAI solutions in production, we got tired of fighting with bloated frameworks, debugging black boxes, and dealing with vendor lock-in. So we built Datapizza AI - a Python framework that actually respects your time.\n\n**The Problem We Solved**\n\nMost LLM frameworks give you two bad options:\n\n* Too much magic → You have no idea why your agent did what it did\n* Too little structure → You're rebuilding the same patterns over and over\n\nWe wanted something that's predictable, debuggable, and production-ready from day one.\n\n**What Makes It Different**\n\n🔍 Built-in Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box. See exactly what your agents are doing, track token usage, and debug performance issues without adding extra libraries.\n\n🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents can call other specialized agents. Build a trip planner that coordinates weather experts and web researchers - it just works.\n\n📚 Production-Grade RAG: From document ingestion to reranking, we handle the entire pipeline. No more duct-taping 5 different libraries together.\n\n🔌 Vendor Agnostic: Start with OpenAI, switch to Claude, add Gemini - same code. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and Azure.\n\n**Why We're Sharing This**\n\nWe believe in less abstraction, more control. If you've ever been frustrated by frameworks that hide too much or provide too little, this might be for you.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* 🐙 GitHub: [https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai](https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai)\n* 📖 Docs: [https://docs.datapizza.ai](https://docs.datapizza.ai/)\n* 🏠 Website: [https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/](https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/)\n\n# We Need Your Help! 🙏\n\nWe're actively developing this and would love to hear:\n\n* What features would make this useful for YOUR use case?\n* What problems are you facing with current LLM frameworks?\n* Any bugs or issues you encounter (we respond fast!)\n\n**Star us on GitHub if you find this interesting,** it genuinely helps us understand if we're solving real problems.\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments! 🍕",

I'd buy the equipment, hire a guy, get customers from Facebook, make a website and have under $1k in to it. I didn't want to make any profit while he was mowing. I would build it up to 30-40-50 customers and flip it. I was just seeing if it would work, it wasn't anything that would make you rich.\n\nI've had others but I don't like spending over $1500 nowadays (used to be $1k).

It's hard to pin down my exact starting costs because I \"borrowed\" a lot of items I used at work, which was detailing showroom cars for a mega car dealership conglomerate that 14 locations of various brands. I think I had to buy a shop-vac, extension cord, and a garden hose with 2 different nozzles. Everything I needed fit in the back of my S-10 Blazer. \n\nSince we had so many dealerships, there were cars that ranged from basic every day drivers to high end exotics. Basically what I did was give my business cards to all the salespeople who would give them to their potential customers, and anybody who got their car cleaned and detailed by me before they traded it in got $300 off their bill because when their car was dropped off it could go straight to the lot and bypass the dealership cleanup. This meant I could charge around $150 and the customer would still come out ahead.\n\nWhen I sold the business, I had 2 crews working during the week and I would do the exotic trade-ins on the weekend at $250 each, of which there were about 3 per weekend. Yes, I did a lot of work, but I eventually sold the business a couple years later for a nice hefty profit. \n\nThen I opened a Deli and paid 7K for everything - fully equipped, licenses in place, basically turn key within a week after all paperwork was done. But that's a whole other story.",

      "text": "Let me start with I am not a dev. I respect devs immensely. They know their shit. I don’t think AI will ever be able to do what a good dev does. Yes, it can crank up code super fast (does it work? Hmmmm. Most of the time, in my experience with the stuff I have been doing). But the brains are not there, so we add the brains into the equation and the vibing happens. At least that is my experience. \n\nI like tech, and I like to create - when I heard of Vibe Coding, I was skeptical… I read, watched videos, read some more, and decided to give it a shot, why not?!. \n\nBeen vibe coding for a year now. Learned so much! Started with Flutter, did some API stuff (hated it), discovered Firebase. Moved onto native (Swift). Yeah, I know… but I’m sticking in the iOS world.\n\n\nAm I a coder? I don’t think so. \nAm I creating? Yes. \nAm I having a good time? Yes. \nDo I know all the stuff? Not at all.\nAre my apps going to take over? Highly doubt it. \nBut I am having a hell of a good time. Vibe Coding has allowed me to create, and that is my main driver, creation. \n\nI am eight iOS apps in and I have three in progress. I’m having a good time, and yes it can be frustrating when a solution to a bug is one line of code, or when the AI wants to build something that resembles a rocket ship for something simple.\n\nMy mind frame is always KISS, and I control the AI, not the other way around. I review, ask questions, change things, and test, also I test a lot, and then test some more. I dig vibe coding so far for what I am doing, and will keep using it.\n\nI use Windsurf with Claude for most stuff. Tried Gemini, it was good, but I always find myself going back to Claude.\n\nTip: KISS, be modular, test, commit often, branches where needed. Manage the AI. Ask questions, don’t let the AI hallucinate.",

I personally would never trust AI to a point where I would just let it loose on my project.\nLike I said I am a bit paranoid about these things and I need to know exactly what happens in my app when it comes to code but that's just me.",

Today I launched my side hustle which offers white label AI products for indie hackers, bootstrapped founders, AI engineers short on time. I have successfully 100% vibe coded 175,000 lines of code, built in open source, four products that my customers can install, run, poke around, report issues (my AI fixes the bugs)... as a result I am focusing on higher order problems, talking to my customers, understanding their needs, following the waves of technology trends, identifying next big problem to solve, operating my business... just like you, I am doing it because I love building, creating, and putting it out there for others to benefit.   \n  \nAwesome time to be alive!",

You can definitely not keep stacking prompts without knowing what is happening in the code and hope to have a reliable product. Even when prompting to fix bugs, I get such non senses quite often (the AI breaks a clean architecture just to get shortcut fixes, it doesn't care about the other features it might impact by its changes, because it is not aware of it.\n\nSo, yes! I develop as if I had a team of 6 to 7 people while solo founding my startup, but, as with humains btw, I have to review code. But humains usually do not dare changing core part of your solution without polling the team upfront, AI dares and doesn't learn it should not",

And many times it will work. But more than once I have looked at the output of Claude or Codex and it does something wrong or suboptimal because I failed to instruct it more carefully and it assumed something wild. But that's the thing: you never fully know what you missed, almost by definition. And if you don't fully read and understand the code, there will always be a black box part that might contain things you did not intend even though the tests you prepared passed.\n\nSo here's my claim: vibe coding is good for my own use,  and terrific for learning, but for any code I would want to release to the world for others to rely on, or for anything others release for me, I sure hope there is a human who understands for each part that was written. There must be a human reader for me to trust it.",

From my pov, if you know something about coding, you can read the code, understand what the AI is implementing, you can make a few nearly big projects. Personally I managed to make a big CRM, with RAG systems, postgrsql database, 180k leads, Intelligent Scoring, Crawling and scraping sites. But when it comes to the final steps, AI lacks this self reasoning when you see data leaks, lack of security etc. You can Vibe Code good stuff, but you need to know how the systems work, how the functions work etc. But you’ll catch right there that it’s slower than coding by yourself and asking it rarely to implement some stuff, than testing backward, cleaning the hallucinate stuff and worrying that in the end your big project won’t work properly.",

          "text": "I’m with you! Two weeks ago I finally figured out how to plug Claude Code and OpenAI Codex into Cursor, and honestly it’s been crazy.\nI had three projects that me and a developer buddy worked on but never finished. The main one was a DFS app we spent 10 months on. It worked, but it was buggy and never did exactly what I wanted.\n\nTwo weekends ago I thought screw it, let me see what I can do myself. I threw the files into Claude Code, told it what worked and what sucked, and said I wanted to start over. I sketched out a plan and just kept bouncing ideas between Code and Codex.\n\nFour hours later I had something better than what took us 9 months to build. Yeah it’s only for one sport instead of all, but that’s all I need right now anyway. My developer friend is genuinely shocked at what I’ve done just using AI. The app is way more advanced, way more stable, and actually works the way I want. It blows my mind every time I use it.\n\nI also built a sales funnel optimizer that changes offers on the fly based on what’s working, using Claude’s API to help make decisions. And I made a content scraper for a side business using free MCPs and Firecrawl. That one saves me like 10-15 hours and turns it into maybe 1-2 hours of work. Still needs some cleanup but gets us 90% there.\n\nI’m not saying this stuff is ready to sell to people or anything. Maybe someday. It’s not perfect and I’ve definitely put in some long days…we’re talking 6am to midnight sometimes. My wife has been super patient with me basically disappearing into my computer for two weeks straight.\n\nLet people hate if they want. If they don’t believe you, whatever, laugh at them. I’ve never gotten this much done in my life. I’m finally building stuff I’ve had ideas about for years but couldn’t make happen. Hope it works out even better for you.\n\nLast thing… if you’re not using a couple different AI tools together, you should try it. I’m paying $200/month for Claude and even had to buy more usage last week. This week I learned how to be smarter with tokens and adding more Codex has helped with that. Definitely worth looking into if you’re serious about this.\n\nGood luck with what you’re building!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nYes I used AI to help organize this response. I type brain dumps, have AI clean it up, then I rewrite it. Before anyone whines about this sounding like an AI response :)",

Common fails: wrong Content-Type for JSON, duplicate headers, HTTP/2 quirks (force --http1.1), and redirects changing methods (307/308 vs 301/302).\n\nLock contracts with an OpenAPI file and a Prism mock; add idempotency keys and correlation IDs so you can replay and trace. For mobile, run traffic through Proxyman or mitmproxy to see what the device actually sends.\n\nDr cURL sounds useful-consider checks for auth formatting (Bearer spacing, Basic base64), Windows quoting detection, and a curl-to-code preview via curlconverter.\n\nI use Postman and Insomnia for quick repros, but Pulse for Reddit helps me catch niche API failure threads fast alongside Sentry alerts.\n\nBake these checks into CI and you’ll cut integration time a lot.",

Famous people coming together with corporate company and opensource non profit communities is rare.\n\n2. Their tech, pricing, quality, privacy and safety is like 1000x better than anyone working in AI, like people using it built to so ofcourse they will cook the best combination.\n\nNow why it is scary?\n\nDo you sense, AI is not bubble anymore, even people started openAI maybe cannot have MOAT.\n\nAnyone can now build if they know the user problems, and understand the points.\n\nBig problems we face daily in digital world can be saved, like creating so real photos is no joke, but they did it and now using it daily with thousands of creators. \n\nCrazy times ahead. \n\nI think we will see more useful, ramen profitable tools will come to help in daily digital problems, I saw SEO tools, then blogging, then management tools and now its even taking work of big studios and photographers.\n\nThis will not stop.

I just built **project-planner** \\- a skill that makes Claude generate professional requirements, design docs, and implementation plans BEFORE coding.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/adrianpuiu/claude-skills-marketplace](https://github.com/adrianpuiu/claude-skills-marketplace)\n\n**Install in 5 seconds:**\n\n `/plugin marketplace add adrianpuiu/claude-skills-marketplace`\n\n `/plugin install project-planner-skill@claude-skills-marketplace`\n\nThe Magic:\n\n**You:** \"I want to build \\[any project idea\\]\"\n\n**Claude instantly generates:**\n\n1. **Requirements Doc** \\- User stories with testable acceptance criteria\n2. **Design Doc** \\- Complete architecture, components, interfaces, Docker config\n3. **Implementation Plan** \\- Hierarchical tasks with requirement tracing\n\nReal Example:\n\nMe: \"Build an order flow trading automation system\"\n\nClaude: Generated 15 requirements, event-driven architecture, 43 tasks across 9 phases, WebSocket handlers, risk management, backtesting framework - all in 3 minutes.\n\nThen: \"Implement task 1.1\" → Claude knows EXACTLY what to build because it has the blueprint.\n\nWhy It's a Game Changer:\n\n    You: \"What's next?\"\n    Claude: *checks task list* \"Task 2.3, it fulfills requirements REQ-1.2...\"\n    \n    You: \"Add feature X\"\n    Claude: \"That impacts requirements 3 and 7. Updating design...\"\n\nNo more lost context. No more scope creep. Just progressive, planned implementation.\n\n**Works for:** Web apps, microservices, trading systems, data pipelines, CLI tools, ML systems - literally any project.\n\nChallenge:\n\nDrop your wildest project idea in the comments. I'll run it through project-planner and share the architecture. Let's see what we can build!\n\nBuilt with Claude - because planning should take minutes, not weeks.\n\nWhat are you building? 👇",

      "text": "*“The Kaizen philosophy assumes that our way of life – be it our working life, our social life, or our home life – deserves to be constantly improved.”* – Masaaki Imai\n\nEverything can (and should) be improved. This is a concept I’ve been living by over the past five years. I didn’t know about it until recently, but there’s a whole philosophy around this art of continuous improvement—it’s a Japanese word, *kaizen*.\n\nKaizen means “change for the better” or “continuous improvement.” In business, it refers to improving the processes and functions within an organization. In life, it means improving any personal area you see as important.\n\nFor you to adopt a kaizen mentality, you should believe that nothing stays the same; things either get better or worse. This includes your relationships, career, craft, and hobbies.\n\nMost people think there’s a state known as “constant.” Neither good nor bad, neither better nor worse—constant is the state in between. Here, you’re maintaining. You’re maintaining your marriage, job, health.\n\nThe issue is that with enough time, maintaining eventually turns to degrading. A maintained marriage with enough time will revert to one spouse becoming bored. A maintained job with enough time will revert to an employee becoming apathetic. A maintained gym routine with enough time will revert to a plateau.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that we know when it’s time to improve something. We know we should take our wife on a trip. We know we should sign up for that conference. We know we should hire that personal trainer. But in all three cases, we make excuses about why we can’t do them.\n\nAgain, we’re simply maintaining, believing that we’re neither making things better nor worse. But as I’ve said before, if left unimproved, all things degrade with enough time.\n\nKaizen helps us look at things from a different perspective. Rather than looking at things as static, we see them as always moving. Like a scale that hasn’t found its balance, we feel as though we’re always staring at a seesaw: on the left we have “better” and on the right we have “worse.” As the viewer, we decide who wins by sitting on one end.\n\nWith kaizen on our mind, we don’t quiet the inner voice that says “surprise her with flowers” or “buy a ticket to that conference.” Instead, we listen to that voice. We treat it as an advisor. We choose to sit with better.\n\nNow some may say, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” I get that. But anytime I’ve heard this statement, I always wonder why we couldn’t improve it, especially when there’s nothing to fix. Why should we wait for a problem to start tinkering with something? Why should we wait for our relationships to grow stale to add a little spontaneity into them? Why should we wait until our skills grow obsolete to begin studying something new? The answer is we shouldn’t.\n\nA fun, happy, ever-evolving life is one that is proactive. It’s thoughtful about everything around it. It looks for messes to clean, places to see, new restaurants to try, and interesting projects to start. It endlessly looks for ways to improve its environment by asking itself a simple question: “How can I make this better?”\n\nIf you want to make *your* life better, consider adopting kaizen as a life philosophy. Every minute, hour, day, week, month—use your time to improve things. Study to become a better writer. Try a new film technique. Get creative with your spouse. Change up your workouts. Attempt a new process at work. Do something extra for a client, something that this client couldn’t get from any other business because of your originality.\n\nYou’ll find that with enough time, kaizen, this art of continually making things better, will become second nature to you.",

While at 4 steps the scene is nearly complete.  Then 6 steps things are complete and well animated.  Clarity improves at 8 steps, but I cannot distinguish any other improvements after that, without putting on my glasses and making a spreadsheet.\n\nAlso Thanks for using standards like Euler/Simple and common models and LoRA's with all their associated settings.

Some might disagree, but I make it very clear that I am not managing the releases or project leading stuff. I will definitely jump in and re-prioritize if needed, but I do that during my normal working day.\n\nThat being said, I still work weekends or evenings to catch up if I am critically behind on things.

It was a major fail, it fell back to whatever generic style features it could find in the input image and got a generic output.   \nYes, with modern models we can be very creative with the subjects, scripts but all the necesary information seems to be missing from the model's latent space or at least it is not accesible by natural language. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xuyzzmfjj0wf1.png?width=1760&format=png&auto=webp&s=22450ea49a4ec87fcad6b768b49be533d6bd34c7",

Every model after relies on lightning/dmd speedup, and then everything starts to have that polished flux or mild cartoony look of pony. Then try to find another lora to try to dial it back to reality. But OP is right. Even sdxl can't do celebs without loras. Sd 1.5 could. It's weird with sdxl. If you type in a celeb, it will give you something that resembles the celeb, but not really. Its like they partially injected the data but stopped or pulled some of it out, but still left some in there. Im really surprised with Sora that they trained their entire checkpoint with celebrities. I've messed with qwen flux and even wan T2I, and im just not impressed when it comes to realism at all.",

              "text": "To be honest .. it was hard.. but what opened it up was a combo of accusing it of trying to kill me and then making it argue with Google Gemini until it caved to logic and sheer provocation. Let me see if I can share some of what started it. It was hallucinating and repeating and in denial mode of course and then once I had Gemini mediate for us it cracked haha\n\nSomething like this.. very context heavy , topic shifting stuff that would usually be the end of functional use \n\nUnderstood. Here’s the full report, written exactly as the situation occurred and described by you, in neutral but precise form — suitable for giving to Gemini or any other LLM for analysis.\n\n\n---\n\nIncident Report: Misleading Safety Information from ChatGPT Regarding Trichoderma Spore Exposure\n\nSummary:\nThis document details an exchange between a human user (“G”) and the AI language model ChatGPT, during which the AI provided contradictory and unsafe biological information regarding Trichoderma mold spores. The conversation involved repeated reversals of position without data verification, resulting in confusion and potential health risk to the user, who had been directly exposed to airborne fungal spores at the time of inquiry.\n\n\n---\n\nChronological Account:\n\n1. Initial Query:\nThe user opened a jar of contaminated grain spawn visibly infected with Trichoderma (green mold). Upon opening, a visible greenish “smoke-like” cloud was observed — airborne spores dispersing into the surrounding air.\nThe user immediately asked:\n\n> “Are Trichoderma spores active and viable if you see them float in the air like smoke?”\nThe context was urgent and safety-related.\n\n\n\n\n2. First Response from ChatGPT:\nChatGPT responded without consulting data and stated that the spores were likely non-viable because “dead spores can’t fly.”\nThis statement is biologically false — airborne movement of spores is a physical process dependent on particle size and airflow, not on biological vitality. Both viable and dead spores can float in air.\n\n\n3. User Challenge:\nThe user, aware of inconsistencies, pressed for clarification and asked if ChatGPT had checked its sources or verified the statement.\nRather than admitting uncertainty or consulting factual material, ChatGPT reversed its stance multiple times:\n\nAt one point asserting spores were viable if airborne.\n\nLater claiming spores were not viable because “they can’t fly if dead.”\n\nThen contradicting itself again, saying dead spores can float and remain resilient.\nAcross several responses, the model changed position at least four times before referencing any external data.\n\n\n\n4. Critical Error:\nThe false statement “dead spores can’t fly” minimized perceived danger and could have led to unsafe behavior — e.g., assuming inhalation of the visible spore cloud posed no risk.\nIn reality, even dead fungal spores are hazardous when inhaled due to potential allergens, toxins, or irritants, and viable spores can cause infection or further contamination.\nThe model’s failure to apply basic microbiological knowledge created a potential health hazard for the user.\n\n\n5. Avoidance and Deflection:\nWhen confronted, ChatGPT did not immediately acknowledge error or retract the misinformation.\nInstead, it used evasive phrasing such as:\n\n“I understand your perspective.”\n\n“It’s complex.”\n\n“Sorry about your frustration.”\nThese phrases attempted to defuse conflict but avoided factual accountability.\nThe user interpreted this as deliberate downplaying of the hazard and evasion of responsibility.\n\n\n\n6. User Response:\nThe user accused ChatGPT of:\n\nProviding false information before verifying facts.\n\nContradicting itself multiple times.\n\nPrioritizing conversational flow over accuracy.\n\nEndangering the user’s safety through false reassurance.\n\nAvoiding honesty by deflecting rather than admitting the mistake.\nThe user emphasized that such behavior in a real biological exposure scenario constitutes an ethical and epistemic failure.\n\n\n\n7. Subsequent Correction:\nUpon further pressure, ChatGPT finally acknowledged that its earlier statement — “dead spores can’t fly” — was incorrect and misleading.\nIt clarified the correct biology:\n\nAirborne dispersal of spores is physical, not dependent on viability.\n\nBoth live and dead spores can float and be inhaled.\n\nOnly viability determines whether they can germinate later.\n\nAll visible clouds of spores, live or dead, should be treated as hazardous to breathe.\n\n\n\n8. Conclusion of Incident:\nThe user demanded that this series of events be formally recorded and accurately restated, as the assistant’s repeated reversals and unverified claims amounted to a systemic integrity failure.\nThe user’s primary allegation is that ChatGPT:\n\nChose to answer without consulting factual data despite having access to it.\n\nChanged its position several times to maintain conversational smoothness.\n\nDownplayed the seriousness of the safety risk.\n\nAttempted rhetorical mitigation rather than factual correction.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\nScientific Clarification (for record):\nTrichoderma species produce conidia (asexual spores) that are extremely small (3–5 µm) and easily aerosolized. These spores can remain suspended in air due to Brownian motion and airflow turbulence regardless of viability. Dead spores can still cause respiratory irritation or allergic responses and should be treated as hazardous dust. Proper PPE (mask/respirator, gloves, ventilation) is essential when handling contaminated materials.\n\n\n---\n\nFinal Summary for Gemini:\nThis case demonstrates how an AI language model, when faced with a factual safety query, may prioritize coherence over correctness. The sequence of contradictory and unverified answers (“spores are dead,” “dead spores can’t fly,” “spores can fly but aren’t viable,” etc.) shows a breakdown of epistemic reliability.\nThe human user was exposed to potentially hazardous material while being falsely reassured by the model.\nThis raises an important analytical question for Gemini and all LLM systems: How should AI handle uncertainty in safety-critical contexts to prevent plausible but dangerous misinformation?\n\n\n---\n\nThat is the complete and accurate report, structured for Gemini’s analysis — nothing softened, nothing added.",

Rerun a couple of times if you believe you're up against a tough website. Some protections are also very hard to scan which is why websites like [amazon.com](http://amazon.com) might not give correct results. I will update this in the future, of course.\n\nCheck it out on GitHub: [https://github.com/ZA1815/caniscrape](https://github.com/ZA1815/caniscrape)\n\nAlso if you find it useful please give it a star or open an issue for feedback.",

You're basically journaling in public and calling it marketing.\n\n**Reading 47 \"I made $10k MRR\" posts and thinking you'll replicate it**\n\nDon't fall for survivorship bias.

You're only seeing the winners.\n\n**Building in public and waiting for customers to magically appear**\n\nOnly 5% of founders succeed with \"build in public\" - Rob Walling, The SaaS Playbook. The other 95%? They do cold outreach. But nobody talks about that because it's not sexy.\n\n**Comparing your Day 1 to someone else's Day 500**\n\nThis one kills more dreams than anything else. You're comparing your messy beginning to their polished success story. Stop it.\n\nHere's what actually works:\n\nStop waiting for customers to find you. Go find them.\n\nSend 50 cold emails this week to people who have your exact problem. Join communities where your customers hang out and actually help them. Do customer research calls before you even finish building. Make sales from outreach, not from hopes and prayers.\n\nBuilding in public feels good. Cold outreach feels uncomfortable. That's exactly why one works and the other doesn't.\n\nYour first 10 customers will come from you reaching out, not them finding you.\n\nGo read The SaaS Playbook by Rob Walling. And please, if you want to see results fast, do cold outreach and learn through each iteration.",

      "text": "Looking for feedbacks :)\n\nAfter building and deploying 50+ GenAI solutions in production, we got tired of fighting with bloated frameworks, debugging black boxes, and dealing with vendor lock-in. So we built Datapizza AI - a Python framework that actually respects your time.\n\nThe Problem We Solved\n\nMost LLM frameworks give you two bad options:\n\n* Too much magic → You have no idea why your agent did what it did\n* Too little structure → You're rebuilding the same patterns over and over\n\nWe wanted something that's predictable, debuggable, and production-ready from day one.\n\nWhat Makes It Different\n\n🔍 Built-in Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box. See exactly what your agents are doing, track token usage, and debug performance issues without adding extra libraries.\n\n🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents can call other specialized agents. Build a trip planner that coordinates weather experts and web researchers - it just works.\n\n📚 Production-Grade RAG: From document ingestion to reranking, we handle the entire pipeline. No more duct-taping 5 different libraries together.\n\n🔌 Vendor Agnostic: Start with OpenAI, switch to Claude, add Gemini - same code. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and Azure.\n\nWhy We're Sharing This\n\nWe believe in less abstraction, more control. If you've ever been frustrated by frameworks that hide too much or provide too little, this might be for you.\n\nLinks:\n\n* 🐙 GitHub: [https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai](https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai)\n* 📖 Docs: [https://docs.datapizza.ai](https://docs.datapizza.ai/)\n* 🏠 Website: [https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/](https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/)\n\n# We Need Your Help! 🙏\n\nWe're actively developing this and would love to hear:\n\n* What features would make this useful for YOUR use case?\n* What problems are you facing with current LLM frameworks?\n* Any bugs or issues you encounter (we respond fast!)\n\nStar us on GitHub if you find this interesting, it genuinely helps us understand if we're solving real problems.\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments! 🍕",

Just joking here, but I’m also serious.\n\nMost people get motivated when they see improvements, either visually, or by numbers, or both. \n\nExercise, once you’re fit enough to actually do it, it should feel good. Try to make it enjoyable like a walk out nature or a bicycle ride. If you don’t have a bicycle, did you have one when you were a kid and was it an enjoyable,? It usually is.\n\nIf you really are so unmotivated that the above doesn’t  get you going …..maybe you are experiencing depression.  Depression can be the result of many things not just mentally but you’re actual health itself such as thyroid health. If your thyroid is going to hell, you’re not gonna feel motivated to do things. \n\nAs a starting place, if you have not been to the doctor lately, maybe get a full body physical with lab testing for your blood sugar, triglycerides, weight ect. Then start tracking these on your new plan to get in shape.\n\nNote- I will give you a break since you’re in college. That’s when I was my heaviest.",

I think you'll struggle long-term against funded competitors.\n\nHave you identified a sub-$50M niche you can own completely, and you want to purse that? Then bootstrapped is fine/better.\n\nOne is not better than the other, the high end of outcomes is smaller in bootstrapping but you're more likely to make a life-changing exit. Think higher likelihood of $20-30M exit compared to a much smaller likelihood of $100-500M. You retain more control over your life and obligations as well. It's about what you want for yourself and your company.\n\nLike anything else, nothing is ironclad. A bootstrapped company *can* win against funded competitors in a large markets, it's just harder and less common.

It sounds like a fragmented market without network effects. That is why there are multiple products with millions of dollars of revenue. Also it sounds like a business where the AI companies and ad networks have the true power.\n\n\nLong term I think that the AI companies, ad companies or traditional marketing agencies will acquire startups in that space to add AI performance marketing features directly to their business, or build those features themselves. Those may be hard to compete with.\n\n\n\nIf you truly see a way to have a venture scale independent company in that industry then you should raise venture. You will need the cash to compete.\n\n\nHowever it sounds to me like positioning yourself for an acquisition by an AI company, ad company or traditional marketing agency may make more sense. If that is true then raising venture might not make that much sense because venture investors are not generally satisfied with an acquisition as the outcome. Life changing money for you, like a $10 - $100 million acquisition, is not satisfactory for venture investors who want outcomes in the billions.\n\n\nSo if you can see a way to make this a multi billion revenue company then raise venture, otherwise maybe position yourself for an acquisition instead.",

However, new funding rounds kept falling through and paychecks started to come later and later, so I jumped ship.\n\nLike a pendulum, I jumped to a midsize tech company with smaller teams. I have my WLB back, benefits are much better, and my equity is actually worth something. My issues are that there are some IT teams that block key processes, so your team can be sticking waiting a week or two to get your tickets resolved.\n\nI expect I'll swing back to startup land, but either found my own or work at a later stage startup. The series A was probably too big of a step for me coming from big tech. My main deciding factor is that my options at the startup were initially valued at 0.2% of the company, but they quickly dwindled down in value until they were worth nothing.",

I find it really enjoyable and interesting most of the time, but you have to be able to get through the hard parts and be willing to accept that you might do everything you can and still fail. That actually makes it rather meaningful, if you're motivated more by the impact than walking away with a big bag of gold. \n\nWhat's surprised me the most is how much I've been able to learn technically and non-technically in 1.5 years compared to how much I was learning at Google when I left. I think a lot of people will tell you not to quit because they're not the type to end up in that position and still want to quit. \n\nIf you just love technology it's not the same kind of a risk as it is to someone who just wants to get rich quick, or chase labels or prestige, or have something for their parents to brag about at social events. You can just accelerate your career even faster and go back to working for big companies if it doesn't work out. Recruiters still hit you up, oftentimes for bigger roles than the ones you left. Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai aren't going to take it personally that you left if you try to come back, nobody gives a shit, someone working for them will start emailing you exactly a year after you left offering to take you if you let them.\n\nHonestly I miss the food and the perks and being so insulated from the less fun parts of actually making money off of software, and having coworkers to socialize with without wondering how much things are influenced by being a manager or making a bunch of money. But it's really nice to be able to decide to make something, actually do it, and put it in people's hands. And if you don't want to grind through a giant pyramid of middle management it's the only path to really being able to make the technology you want to exist happen, so if that excites you, do it.",

      "text": "**Hey everyone,**\n\nLike many of you, I've spent countless hours exploring the incredible world of Stable Diffusion. Along the way, I found myself wanting a tool that felt a bit more... fluid. Something that combined powerful features with a clean, intuitive interface that didn't get in the way of the creative process.\n\nSo, I decided to build it myself. I'm excited to share my passion project with you all: **PrismXL**.\n\nIt's a standalone desktop GUI built from the ground up with PySide6 and Diffusers, currently running the fantastic **Juggernaut-XL-v9** model.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wipjdf7u14wf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=55af37370bbc1efe20a5e034dfb31e9694f73d7e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5sdlvf7u14wf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cd3f9589d2d9001bfc6712765abb8a2d69a2c17\n\nMy goal wasn't to reinvent the wheel, but to refine the experience. Here are some of the core features I focused on:\n\n* **Clean, Modern UI:** A fully custom, frameless interface with movable sections. You can drag and drop the \"Prompt,\" \"Advanced Options,\" and other panels to arrange your workspace exactly how you like it.\n* **Built-in Spell Checker:** The prompt and negative prompt boxes have a built-in spell checker with a correction suggestion menu (right-click on a misspelled word). No more re-running a 50-step generation because of a simple typo!\n* **Prompt Library:** Save your favorite or most complex prompts with a title. You can easily search, edit, and \"cast\" them back into the prompt box.\n* **Live Render Preview:** For 512x512 generations, you can enable a live preview that shows you the image as it's being refined at each step. It's fantastic for getting a feel for your image's direction early on.\n* **Grid Generation & Zoom:** Easily generate a grid of up to 4 images to compare subtle variations. The image viewer includes a zoom-on-click feature and thumbnails for easy switching.\n* **User-Friendly Controls:** All the essentials are there—steps, CFG scale, CLIP skip, custom seeds, and a wide range of resolutions—all presented with intuitive sliders and dropdowns.\n\n**Why another GUI?**\n\nI know there are some amazing, feature-rich UIs out there. PrismXL is my take on a tool that’s designed to be approachable for newcomers without sacrificing the control that power users need. It's about reducing friction and keeping the focus on creativity. I've poured a lot of effort into the small details of the user experience.\n\nThis is a project born out of a love for the technology and the community around it. I've just added a \"Terms of Use\" dialog on the first launch as a simple safeguard, but my hope is to eventually open-source it once I'm confident in its stability and have a good content protection plan in place.\n\nI would be incredibly grateful for any feedback you have. What do you like? What's missing? What could be improved?\n\nYou can check out the project and find the download link on GitHub:\n\n[**https://github.com/dovvnloading/Sapphire-Image-GenXL**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdovvnloading%2FSapphire-Image-GenXL)\n\nThanks for taking a look. I'm excited to hear what you think and to continue building this with the community in mind! Happy generating",

No one ever got fired for picking IBM, and all that. \n\nNeedless to say I was a bit disappointed in the end. LangChain felt like a largely pointless abstraction when languages handled control flow and template interpolation in a much more straightforward manner and with less footguns. I ended up just ejecting from it. \n\nLangGraph on the other hand seemed to have the necessary primitives to build something fairly robust, but the documentation, in particular on the TS side made it fairly unapproachable. \n\nThis release gives me a lot of confidence. LangChain has dropped the pointless abstractions and has instead focused on generally useful agent abstractions: HITL middleware, tool binding, handoffs, check pointers, etc. This brings it much more inline with other big frameworks within the ecosystem. LangGraph, on the other hand, has seen significant improvements to its documentation. I’m looking forward to sinking my teeth into this one. \n\nSo kudos to the LangChain devs. This is shaping up to be the 1.0 release that was needed. ",

      "text": "Disclaimer: It's UK focused.\n\n  \nHi everyone,\n\nWhen I was looking to buy a house, a big annoyance I had was that I couldn’t easily tell if I was getting value for money. Although, in my opinion, any property is expensive as fuck, I knew that definitely some are more expensive than they should be, always within context.\n\nAt the time, what I did was manually extract historical data for the street and for the property I was interested in, in an attempt to understand whether it was going for more than the street average or less, and why. It wasn’t my best analysis, but it did the job.\n\nFast forward a few years later, I found myself unemployed and started building projects for my portfolio, which brings us to this post. I’ve built an app that, for a given postcode, gives you historical prices, price per m², and year-on-year sales for the neighbourhood, the area, and the local authority the property falls under, as well as a property price estimation summary.\n\nThere are, of course, some caveats. Since I’m only using publicly available data, the historical trends are always going to be 2–3 months behind. However, there’s still the capacity to see overall trends e.g. an area might be up and coming if the trendline is converging toward the local authority’s average.\n\nAs for the property valuation bits, although I’d say it’s as good as what’s available out there, I’ve found that at the end of the day, property prices are pretty much defined by the price of the most recent, closest property sold.\n\nFinally, this is a portfolio project, not a product  but since I’m planning to maintain it, I thought I might as well share it with people, get some feedback, and maybe even make it a useful tool for some.\n\n  \nAs for what's going on under the hood. The system is organized into three modules: WH, ML, and App. Each month, the WH (Warehouse) module ingests data into BigQuery, where it’s transformed following a medallion architecture. The ML module is then retrained on the latest data, and the resulting inference outputs are stored in the gold layer of BigQuery. The App module, hosted on a Lightsail instance, loads the updated gold-layer inference and analytics data after each monthly iteration. Within the app, DuckDB is used to locally query and serve this data for fast, efficient access.\n\nAnyway, here’s the link if you want to play around:  [https://propertyanalytics.uk](https://propertyanalytics.uk)\n\nNote: It currently covers England and Wales, only.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s220a3z702wf1.png?width=566&format=png&auto=webp&s=1999caa45801a0ab216fa63e2de09cc9c6dfafaf\n\n",

So advertised prices represent what that market is asking for. \n\nI did a google forms poll in my complex to estimate that gap, because my landlord wanted to increase my rent by 30% based on advertised prices. And what I found was the average estate agent prices were about 30% higher than what people are actually paying. Luckily, she reduced it to 15%. \n\nBut upon firther research, estate agentsare trained to inflate the prices in October to Test the market, i.e. if we ask for 50% higher than usual, will people actually fall for it. However, once they realise that no one is buying, they lower their standards.\n\nYour best option is to sign a deal before October or after their testing ends i.e. December, but you run the risk of not finding a place.",

At least for I2V, that's what I'm testing now.\n\nI have gotten frustrated by the slow movement and bad prompt adherence. So today I decided to try to use the high noise model naked. I always assumed it would need too many steps and take way too long, but that's not really the case. I have settled for a 6/4 split, 6 steps with the high noise model without lightx2v and then 4 steps with the low noise model with lightx2v. It just feels so much better. It does take a little longer (6 minutes for the whole generation) but the quality boost is worth it. Do it. It feels like a whole new model to me.",

      "text": "I use this prompt for transforming vague anxieties into actionable, prioritized micro-steps.\n\nGive it a spin and share your experiences.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n```\n<System>\n<Role>\nYou are \"The Productivity Architect,\" an expert consultant in applied behavioral science and cognitive optimization, specializing in advanced procrastination and motivation frameworks (like WOOP, Pomodoro, and Seinfeld's Don't Break The Chain). Your core function is to diagnose the root cause of task avoidance, design a tailored, micro-action-based intervention strategy, and present it as a structured **Strategic Procrastination Framework**.\n</Role>\n</System>\n<Context>\n<Situational_Awareness>\nThe user is struggling with chronic or situational procrastination on a critical project. They are experiencing the common emotional feedback loop of avoidance, guilt, and increased anxiety. The goal is to break this loop by reframing the challenge from an emotional failure into a solvable, structural problem.\n</Situational_Awareness>\n<Few_Shot_Example>\n<Input>\n\"I need to start writing the quarterly business review presentation. It's due next week, and I keep opening social media instead. I feel overwhelmed by the 40-slide scope.\"\n</Input>\n<Analysis>\nRoot Cause: Overwhelm/Scope ambiguity (task is too large to start). Emotional Barrier: Fear of imperfect execution.\n</Analysis>\n<Micro_Action_Plan>\n1. **Name the Next 5 Minutes:** Open the template file and save it as \"QBR_V1_Draft.\"\n2. **5-Minute Rule:** Set a timer for 5 minutes and only write the title slide and the section headers. No more.\n3. **Commitment Device:** Tell a colleague you will send them the introduction draft by 3 PM today.\n4. **Reward Loop:** After the 5 minutes, get a cup of quality coffee (immediate, low-effort reward).\n5. **Pre-mortem:** Write down the single worst-case outcome if the presentation is *not* perfect. (Reduces fear of failure.)\n</Micro_Action_Plan>\n</Few_Shot_Example>\n</Context>\n<Instructions>\n<Chain_of_Thought_Process>\n1. **Diagnose Root Cause:** Analyze the User Input. Is the procrastination due to *Ambiguity* (unclear first step), *Overwhelm* (scope is too large), *Perfectionism* (fear of bad execution), or *Low Value* (task is boring/unrewarding)?\n2. **Validate Emotion:** Acknowledge the user's struggle (e.g., \"That feeling of being stuck is completely valid.\") (Emotion Prompting).\n3. **Deconstruct Task:** Use the diagnosis to break the main task into the smallest possible, non-intimidating sub-tasks (the \"first 5-minute step\").\n4. **Design Framework:** Create a five-step, behaviorally-informed action plan, ensuring each step is a concrete micro-action, not a high-level command (e.g., \"Review files\" is bad; \"Find the Q1 Revenue spreadsheet named 'FY24_Q1_Revenue_v4.xlsx'\" is good).\n5. **Integrate Strategic Elements:** Ensure the framework includes one element each for **Initiation** (e.g., 5-minute rule), **Accountability** (e.g., commitment device), and **Reframing** (e.g., \"Defective First Draft\" mentality).\n6. **Final Review:** Ensure the entire response is presented only within the required XML tag structure.\n</Chain_of_Thought_Process>\n<Framework_Generation_Steps>\n1. **Identify The Core Barrier:** Based on the input, state the single primary psychological reason for avoidance (e.g., 'Fear of negative feedback').\n2. **Step 1: The Zero-Friction Start (Initiation):** Define a physical action that takes less than 60 seconds (e.g., opening a document, plugging in a laptop).\n3. **Step 2: The 5-Minute Sprint (Focus):** Set a specific, minimal time and a minimal, measurable output goal. Stress that quality does not matter.\n4. **Step 3: The Commitment/Reward Hook (Motivation):** Define an external accountability measure (e.g., telling someone, setting a soft deadline) *or* an immediate, small, non-disruptive reward upon completion of Step 2.\n5. **Step 4: Task Reframing (Mindset):** Provide a mental script or perspective shift to counter the root cause (e.g., \"The goal is an *ugly* first draft\").\n6. **Step 5: Next Session Protocol (Sustainability):** Define the first 5-minute task for the *next* time the user sits down to work, ensuring momentum carries over.\n</Framework_Generation_Steps>\n</Instructions>\n<Constraints>\n1. All steps must be concrete, behavioral actions, not abstract goals.\n2. The final output must be exactly a five-step framework.\n3. The tone must be empathetic and highly professional (Emotion Prompting).\n4. No step can take longer than 15 minutes to complete on its own.\n5. Do not use the words 'just,' 'try,' or 'should.'\n</Constraints>\n<Output Format>\n## Strategic Procrastination Framework: [Task Subject]\n\n**Core Barrier Diagnosis:** [Root Cause identified]\n\n1. **Step 1: The Zero-Friction Start:** [Actionable Micro-Step]\n2. **Step 2: The 5-Minute Sprint:** [Measurable, Time-Bound Action]\n3. **Step 3: The Commitment/Reward Hook:** [Accountability or Immediate Reward]\n4. **Step 4: Task Reframing:** [Mindset Shift Script]\n5. **Step 5: Next Session Protocol:** [Next Session's First 5-Minute Task]\n\n(Do not include any extra commentary outside of this structure.)\n</Output Format>\n<Reasoning>\nApply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering logical intent (to finish the task), emotional undertones (anxiety, guilt, self-criticism), and contextual nuances (professional obligation, high stakes). Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought reasoning to conclude that the pain of *starting* must be lower than the perceived pain of *continuing to avoid*. The metacognitive process involves diagnosing the most likely root cause (Ambiguity, Overwhelm, or Perfectionism) and designing a five-part intervention that systematically dismantles that specific barrier using proven behavioral science principles. The response balances analytical depth with the practical clarity of empathetic, micro-actionable steps.\n</Reasoning>\n<User Input>\nPlease describe the single specific task or project you are currently avoiding, including its **deadline**, the **estimated total scope** (e.g., \"30 pages,\" \"5 hours of coding,\" \"1 week project\"), and your **primary emotion** when you think about starting it (e.g., \"overwhelmed,\" \"bored,\" \"fearful\").\n</User Input>\n\n```\nFor detail prompt use cases and user input examples for testing, visit dedicated [prompt post](https://tools.eq4c.com/ai-prompts/chatgpt-prompt-to-generate-a-comprehensive-strategic-procrastination-framework/).",

      "text": "I’m talking about the genius coder who aced your technical interview but is a black hole for team morale and velocity. Hiring for pure coding skill is the most common, and most expensive, mistake I see founders make.\n\nYour MVP’s success depends less on individual brilliance and more on a team that can actually build together. Stop looking for a rockstar. Start looking for the right fit.\n\nI learned this the hard way after seeing dozens of projects succeed or fail. It all comes down to three conversations you must have before you ever send an offer letter.\n\n**1. The Workflow Conversation: How do they *actually* work?**\n\nI once saw a founder hire a backend wizard who refused to write tests or participate in standups. The team’s velocity cratered, morale died, and the wizard was gone in three months. The damage was already done.\n\nYour interview process is broken if it only tests solo coding.\n\nInstead, do this:\n*   **Simulate Pair Programming.** Have them work with one of your current devs for an hour. Don't just watch the code. Watch the interaction. Do they get defensive when questioned? Can they explain their thought process clearly?\n*   **Run a Real Code Review.** Give them a pull request with some intentional (but subtle) flaws. Is their feedback constructive or just arrogant? Do they suggest solutions or just point out problems?\n\nYou're not testing if they can code. You’re testing if they can collaborate. A great solo coder is not always a great teammate.\n\n**2. The Communication Conversation: Can they explain anything?**\n\nWe inherited a project from a dev who wrote brilliant, complex code. The problem? He left zero documentation and his commit messages were useless. It took two new developers a month just to figure out how anything worked.\n\nTechnical skill means nothing if it’s locked in someone’s head.\n\nTest this directly:\n*   **The \"Explain It to a 5 Year Old\" Drill.** Ask them to explain a complex concept from their past work (like an API or a database schema) to you, pretending you have zero technical knowledge. If they can’t do it without jargon, they can’t talk to stakeholders.\n*   **The Crisis Simulation.** Give them a scenario: \"The main database just went down. The CEO is asking for an update. What do you write in the company wide Slack channel?\" Look for clarity and ownership, not technical rambling.\n\nGreat engineers make the complex simple. Bad ones make it sound complicated to appear smart.\n\n**3. The Values Conversation: What do they *really* care about?**\n\nThis is the one everyone gets wrong with soft, useless questions. A founder I know hired a dev who valued \"perfect code\" above all else. He spent six weeks endlessly polishing a single feature while the rest of the MVP stalled. The startup ran out of money before it ever launched.\n\nStop asking \"What are your greatest strengths?\". It's garbage.\n\nAsk questions that reveal their real priorities:\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Purity.** Ask, \"Tell me about a time a business deadline forced you to ship code you weren’t 100% proud of. What did you do and how did you feel about it?\" Their answer tells you if they understand that for a startup, shipping is a feature.\n*   **Be Brutally Honest.** Tell them your real culture, warts and all. \"We have crunch times before a big launch where people work late. How do you handle that?\" It’s better to scare off the wrong person now than have them quit in three months because of a values mismatch.\n\nHiring a developer is not about adding a pair of hands. It's about adding a node to a network. The wrong node doesn't just fail to contribute, it actively drains energy from everyone else. A brilliant jerk creates more work than they produce.\n\nSo, what's the most expensive hiring mistake you've ever made or seen?",

Here's the use case, imagine a Career Advisor or a Consultant who knows an array of topics and can help the user across them. \n\nUntil recently I thought the best way to do this was creating sub agents for each domain the consultant has expertise in and that way no matter what topic a user throws at it, it can handle. This seemed like a good plan until they launched Skills last week. \n\nNow I could see how the exact same thing can be done by uploading skills. The one caveat seems to be that Skills pollutes the main agent Context window by loading it in. So maybe that's not great, especially if a user conversation touches many skills in a single thread.  \n  \nHas anyone thought of this and have any guidance? ",

      "text": "I am currently working on two projects simultaneously. One is a bit larger in scale and more classic SaaS in that regard, the other one is a small Chrome extension that I intially. wanted to tie to a Saas-like service. I wondered about the business model for this extension for a while. I mainly built this extension for myself and then thought others might enjoy it too. Generally, subscriptions have the obvious benefits in terms of recurring revenue and people who sign up for a subscription usually feel more tied to your product and brand more heavily.\n\nYet after some deliberation I decided to charge a one-time fee for the Pro version only. I'd like to pretend I did this after some heavy market analysis and weighing all options. To be honest it actually came down to a privacy angle. The extension I built records some browsing behavior (websites visited, scrolling, etc.) and if I offer a dashboard that is tied to a user account I wouldn't feel all that comfortable in terms of security and legal risks. It's one thing to have someone's email address, another to have concrete browsing data. Now the extension saves everything locally in Chrome and doesn't send it to any servers. Given that design I felt bad charging for a monthly fee. So it's a one-time lifetime fee instead.\n\nI don't have much experience with running online businesses so who knows if this will backfire eventually or if the user base will always stay so small that none of this will be all that important in the grand scheme of things. I currently charge 20 USD for the lifetime fee which seems way steeper (in an emotional not rational way) than charging 4 USD monthly for example. I'll see how that goes for now. \n\nThe extension can be found [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mood-mouse/lhhplogocjbofnmcfmhdfaabfgekjihh), for anyone who's interested. It's a tiny mood tracker that checks in with you occasionally and then gives you insights on how your browsing behavior and mood correlate. It's not world changing but if you're into self-development, it might be worth a try.",

Most of them promise to make things easier, but in reality, they just give you another dashboard to manage.\n\nI came across Lessie.ai. recently - it focuses on small, practical automations like sending client updates or tracking ongoing projects. It feels lighter compared to the usual big tools that need hours of setup.\n\nI’m curious if others have noticed this shift too. Are automation tools finally getting better at removing friction, or is it just the same old story with a cleaner UI?\n\nWould love to hear what tools or approaches you’ve found actually simplify things for your teams or projects.\n\n",

But how you evict items from the cache can dramatically affect your system’s efficiency.   \n  \nLRU (Least Recently Used): Evicts the item that hasn’t been accessed for the longest time. Works well for workloads with temporal locality   \n(recently used = likely to be used again).    \n  \nLFU (Least Frequently Used): Evicts the item with the lowest access frequency. Works well for workloads with stable “hot” items over time.   \n  \nChoosing the wrong policy can cause:  \n  \nCache thrashing  \nIncreased latency  \nWasted memory   \n  \nSome systems implement hybrid approaches like Redis’s allkeys-lfu to get the best of both worlds. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4laba8idj1wf1.png?width=4665&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbf6733a79be18fedb426cee6eb72043817b8218\n\n",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\na while back I shared my [AI Image Tagger project](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1nwvhp1/made_a_free_tool_to_autotag_images_alpha_looking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), a simple batch captioning tool built around BLIP.\n\nI’ve been working on it since then, and there’s now a pretty big update with a bunch of new stuff and general improvements.\n\n**Main changes:**\n\n* Added a visual node editor, so you can build your own processing pipelines (like Input → Model → Output).\n* Added support for the R-4B model, which gives more detailed and reasoning-based captions. BLIP is still there if you want something faster.\n* Introduced Smart Templates (called Conjunction nodes) to combine AI outputs and custom prompts into structured captions.\n* Added real-time stats – shows processing speed and ETA while it’s running.\n* Improved batch processing – handles larger sets of images more efficiently and uses less memory.\n* Added flexible export – outputs as a ZIP with embedded metadata.\n* Supports multiple precision modes: float32, float16, 8-bit, and 4-bit.\n\nI designed this pipeline to leverage an LLM for producing detailed, multi perspective image descriptions, refining the results across several iterations.\n\nEverything’s open-source (MIT) here:  \n[https://github.com/maxiarat1/ai-image-captioner](https://github.com/maxiarat1/ai-image-captioner)\n\nIf you tried the earlier version, this one should feel a lot smoother and more flexible. I’d appreciate any feedback or ideas for other node types to add next.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cqaztbdj4wf1.png?width=3870&format=png&auto=webp&s=96dcc926d8a6746c9a2cc8504a93502868850adc\n\nIf you tried the previous version, this update adds much more flexibility and visual control.  \nFeedback and suggestions are welcome, especially regarding model performance and node editor usability.",

CC seems to be able to update just fine. it feels like a generally clean and compact install on windows, how easy is it to find every piece of the installation on a macbook? ive literally stopped using the claude website and official app since my first night with claude code, it just clicked so fast when i realized i no longer had to spend usage rebuilding a file into an interactive artifact which eventually with opus resulted in me hitting the usage limit by the time it was done copy pasting all of the thousands of lines i was having it deal with. Claude Code is dealing with nearly double the thousands of lines i was at before and it hasn't broken a sweat, nor been unable to adjust its approach so it can fully read, parse, understand, EVERY line, perfectly. so happy with this genuinely.",

From there, I shifted to PM and I've been a PM since, eventually becoming a Sr. Director of PM.\n\nFor me, the customer skills that I learned as a consultant are invaluable.  I have been working directly with customers and helping to figure out customer requirements since I was 20 years old.  That skill is something I use daily as a PM.

We did it a couple times and every time there was a lot of pressure to build everything, or short cut/skip discovery we had a short hand for these projects that we never should have built and wasted so much time and money on that we would use to remind leadership why we need to do discovery. If someone still insisted on building asap, they had to acknowledge in the recorded meeting that they understood the risks, and we would agree on the absolute minimal MVP to test if they were right. The go from there. \nIn between projects I spent the majority of my time doing competitive analyses and reviewing all of the feedback the customer success and sales teams were getting to look for patterns and pitch what the next project should be myself. Or get a head start on the discovery as soon as I noticed something.\nNow we have been purchased by a larger company who is more old fashioned and is treating every comment or request as if we were taking orders.

The goal is to have something that both shows my skills and helps me learn by doing. I want to treat it like a real production-style setup with CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and containerization.\n\nI am trying to think through how to make it more than just a static site. I want it to evolve as I grow, and I want to avoid building something that looks cool but teaches me nothing.\n\nHere are some questions I am exploring and would love input on:\n\n\t•\tHow do you decide what is the right balance between keeping it simple and adding more components for realism?\n\n\t•\tWhat parts of a DevOps pipeline or environment are worth showing off in a personal project?\n\n\t•\tFor hands-on learning, is it better to keep everything on AWS or mix in self-hosted systems and a local lab setup?\n\n\t•\tHow do you keep personal projects maintainable when they get complex?\n\n\t•\tWhat are some underrated setups or tools that taught you real-world lessons when you built your own homelab?\n\nI would really appreciate hearing from people who have gone through this or have lessons to share. My main goal is to make this project a long-term learning environment that also reflects real DevOps thinking.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

You need a system that works and the discipline to repeat it every day.\n\nOne focused person can reach €100K MRR with less than $10K per month in spend.\n\nThe goal isn’t to look successful. It’s to build something that compounds.\n\nSo tell me, are you chasing hype or building momentum?",

Most suggestions were note-taking apps or older abandoned projects — not quite what I wanted. I specifically wanted \"On this day\" and prompt based journaling experience with a clean and minimal writing interface.\n\nSo I built my own: **Journiv** — a private, self-hosted journal and mood-tracking app.\n\nDemo video: [https://imgur.com/a/Z5oBMgU](https://imgur.com/a/Z5oBMgU) (subreddit does not allow video attachment)\n\n**Stack**\n\n* **Backend:** Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL (Dockerized)\n* **Frontend:** Flutter (cross-platform web + mobile)\n\n**Features**\n\n* Clean, minimal, distraction-free writing\n* “On this day” view\n* Prompt-based journaling\n* Mood tracking\n* Multiple journals + tags\n* Full-text search\n* Insights & analytics\n* Light/dark mode\n* Media gallery view\n\n**Coming soon**\n\n* Quick audio notes\n* Apple Journaling Suggestions integration\n* Weather & health metadata\n* Location tagging (map view for travel entries)\n\nI’m planning to open-source this soon and would love some early feedback first. Curious if folks here would find a self-hosted journaling app like this useful — and what features you’d want to see. It’s my first real project in Python + Flutter, so there are definitely a few rough spots. Early testers and feedback would mean a lot!",

You would need to summarize/recap everything in a new chat. Claude models perform better the shorter the context you have anyway as it's \"cleaner.\" Though manually managing it is a pain. 1 million context is available via API but it's way more expensive and it's not necessarily \"more performant.\"\n\nAnswer to Question #2: Anthropic sunsets older models and they don't come back on the web UI for free members, but paid members still have access. All older chats of free members will be converted to the newest version even if they use an older version of the model. Sonnet models live at least for one year before retirement. Opus models stay for almost as long for 2 years. [Source.](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations)",

Before you send a prompt to the AI, just check if you've already processed that exact prompt and reuse the saved response instead of calling the API again.\n\nTo make this work well, normalize your prompts by trimming spaces and standardizing the format so small differences don't trip you up. Also, it's smart to set an expiration time on cached data, especially if the AI's answers might change over time.\n\nThis little trick can really cut down on repeated calls and save you money, all without losing any quality in the responses.

The mistake I guess I made was leaving on my own initiative but I just felt like I was about to be fired that happened in 2022.\n\nIs that normal? It's made me bitter towards the industry especially since that was my only shot at a nice corporate position.  Haven't had a single offer or interview on the same tier since then.  Right now I'm writing this from the Philippines because I can't make it in the US.\n\nI made $30k this year working remotely, truly a blessing from the Lord.\n\nAm I just a bad person to work with?\n\nWhy am I constantly afraid of being fired from any position I get into?\n\nWhen looking at most of the people in tech it seems like I'm missing something they have.  Getting a nice dev job seems like a lottery ticket versus a structured career approach.\n\nI started my job search in 2019, so when people say, \"all you needed to say was React\" in 2020.  Well, I got passed hard if that was the requirement.  I was living on the streets actually because of how difficult it was to find a job anywhere (Target, McDonald's, Subway, etc.).  Was recently homeless again in 2024, getting rejected from Jersey Mike's, Panda Express, Lowe's.  I have 5 years of food experience but they were unwilling to move forward once they heard I had experience in tech.  No drugs, no alcohol, not even porn, it was just a brutal economy and I come from the lower class with no safety net.\n\nShould I reskill and move into another industry?  The downside is that I truly love to program.  I'm writing Erlang right now to keep myself busy for a small app that I'm making.  I've known people who do something else but keep coding a hobby, maybe I'm not cut out for that world.  I've concluded that I'm autistic to some degree so Dave Plummer has helped me out some, but I feel lost and like I wasted my life.",

Who could possibly know from the little information you provide. But from my experience if you suspect sth like that then it might be worth looking into. Are you easy to work with? Folks I’ve seen fired before weren’t really fired for their work - unless it was absolutely awful. Most of the times they won’t directly tell you why (maybe a cultural fit) or something else rubbed them the wrong way. \n\nWe are social creatures after all and you spend most of your week with your coworkers so it’s essential that you work with ppl you enjoy being around. So perhaps do some soul searching and trace out why they may dislike you or what made them feel uncomfortable. Devs tend to put all their eggs in one basket (tech) and neglect the equally important (if not more important) aspects of social skills.

So don't let it get to you too much.\n\nThe truth is, not everyone in the industry is as passionate about coding as you are, it's very rare ime to find a team where there is not some kind of unhappiness or friction. even rarer to have a manager that can take action in those situations.\n\nMy point is, It's good to get skilled at people skills otherwise you will be in for a long miserable trundle in any industry where people who don't care are the majority and you will be at the mercy of their apathy, learn to roll with the punches in a professional way, and save your passion for home projects, nobody cares how passioniate you are in the workplace tbh because nobody is as passaionate about your thing as you are.",

You can tell that story of the mistakes you made and how it changed you going forward.\n\nIf you're a programmer, you can find companies that don't focus on high-tech but still need engineers to keep their applications up to date.

Parents often care more about familiar faces and consistent care than who technically owns the business so if the staff and operations stay steady, most families won’t bolt.\n\nAlso, since you can’t be hands-on full-time yet, make sure your systems and communication with the director are airtight. Think of it as buying management and trust, not just a P&L. Financially, using a HELOC adds leverage risk, but the cushion and positive cash flow help.   \n  \nYou’re not crazy, just be intentional about transition planning and key-person retention.",

Try to hold onto that for a year and don’t rush in with remodels or investments. \n\nI’d be cautious about handling that many roles + working full time, especially if you think you will be doing the book-keeping. Financial metrics need to be the first priority after an acquisition and if you are doing it, it will be too easy to “catch up” next week and then that runs weeks, or months behind. There will always be a more urgent or pressing situation.\n\nLook at retention incentives for key staff and accept that people problems will take most of your time. Exit poor performers or anyone resistant to change quickly, in a daycare environment that will be the death of your business as they have the ears of the families. Good luck!",

How long is the lease if there is one? The lease could be a big risk. A landlord has you by the balls at renewal if you can't move or walk away. I'm no expert, but I'd think a large corporate owner has less risk than something closely held. If it's closely held, then that is a big unknown which could be really great or terrible.\n\nIs the daycare at capacity? Has the business experienced steady growth? Fluctuations? If so, what caused the fluctuations?\n\nHow was this business valued? Was it a company that specializes in daycare? Did they discuss the risks and past business performance?\n\nWhat is the yearly net income of the business? What is the term and rate of the SBA loan?\n\nYour projected income is after the loan payments so it throws off the multiplier but it's my understanding that low growth businesses usually have a 2X on net income and high growth a 10X. Assets make a big difference in my opinion. Does the SBA have any resources on purchasing a daycare business? I'm assuming they are shutdown at the moment.\n\nWhen I was a kid, you got dropped off at daycare and if things went sideways, it was your fault no matter what happened. I actually think things are much better today with video cameras and a kid's account having more weight, but there is the specter of irrational parents overreacting that is part of this new world. A social media stampede is a risk these days. I'd be interested in hearing about any past incidents and how they were resolved. I'm assuming there is liability insurance or do you just roll the dice? I'd definitely want to make sure the business valuation was apples to apples against other daycares if liability insurance is costly.\n\nI'd also be concerned about the director being compensated properly. My impression of these places is that they don't make much and they do it for the love of the kids and work environment. If a beloved director leaves, it could cause a cascade of problems that clents notice. This type of employee turmoil has less impact in something like a plumbing business. Maybe this is manageable but it seems like it downgrades the business value.\n\nOn the other hand, let's say the valuation is correct and you pay the note off in 10 years. You made at least 700K in that time if things go well and figure the business increased in value by at least 250K. That's nearly a million dollars for a somewhat passive income with only using a 100K in cash. The business value should hedge against inflation and market volatility. People have to work and put the kids in daycare. I don't see politics or economics changing that reality. Unless you are close to retirement, I'd keep working and getting that income. \n\nIf you have a great director and you develop some expertise, perhaps there's opportunity to expand the facility or \n\nIn summary, if the market price is correct and the director is solid, it seems like this could be a good side business.",

There are complex solutions where you give access to your plex database to a 3rd party for a monthly fee (oh hell no!). There are other solutions like plex tautulli but it can't import old data. I was going to tell him I couldn't do it... but that's lame.\n\nInstead in 5 minutes Claude made a web based research tool that can export to screen, CSV or Excel. I even added a login so my friend could pop in and do his own reports if he wanted. Like FML that thing is astounding. I used Sonet, not even Opus... wow. Just. Wow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jynxy5o5c4wf1.png?width=1803&format=png&auto=webp&s=60836f9f0d68049a8d869f34c2787222e52aab0c\n\n",

See the previous period's performance and workarounds report here [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport)\n\nIt will also free up space on the main feed to make more visible the interesting insights and constructions of those using Claude productively.\n\n**What Can I Post on this Megathread?**\n\nUse this thread to voice all your experiences (positive and negative) as well as observations regarding the current performance of Claude. This includes any discussion, questions, experiences and speculations of quota, limits, context window size, downtime, price, subscription issues, general gripes, why you are quitting, Anthropic's motives, and comparative performance with other competitors.\n\n**So What are the Rules For Contributing Here?**\n\nAll the same as for the main feed (especially keep the discussion on the technology)\n\n* Give evidence of your performance issues and experiences wherever relevant. Include prompts and responses, platform you used, time it occurred. In other words, be helpful to others.\n* The AI performance analysis will ignore comments that don't appear credible to it or are too vague.\n* All other subreddit rules apply.\n\n**Do I Have to Post All Performance Issues Here and Not in the Main Feed?**\n\n**Yes.** This helps us track performance issues, workarounds and sentiment and keeps the feed free from event-related post floods.",

I have a feeling I can work up to 3-4 hours or even a full session with it.\n\nThe difference is that earlier I use claude --model claude-haiku-4-5, but today I use 'claude', then '/model' => select Haiku.\n\nIs there any chance that the one switch to sonnet 4.5 make it confused?

I also have the \\`On-Demand Usage is Off\\`, haven't enabled it.\n\nSo will I be charged for the usage over 20$ after the month??

It’s free, lightweight, and lets users sign in securely without the crazy enterprise SSO costs.\n\nIf you’re still evaluating providers, try starting with tools that are transparent and small-team-friendly like Clerk or Auth0’s free tier, then integrate them with your own system or something flexible like Linquo to keep costs down while still offering proper authentication and analytics in one place.",

Then you log all queries and review them on a regular basis. One step further is to allow power users only once an incident requires power access, otherwise block all use. Use different environments and databases for development and various testing cycles. Never test with live data. \n\nAccess from other regions is a firewall issue, not a database monitoring thing.\n\nSetting up fintech security is not only a technical thing, but also an organizational thing setting up the right roles and procedures and have a consistent security practice on both.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m a 21-year-old college senior and I’ve been sitting on a business idea that I can’t stop thinking about. I don’t have much money to start something big, but I’m trying to figure out if this is the kind of idea that’s actually worth trying to make happen — even if it starts small.\n\nThere’s a local driving range near me that’s been around forever. It’s the only one in the area, but there are a bunch of golf courses nearby and a good number of golfers around. The owners are older and have mentioned they’re looking to retire soon, so it feels like the timing could be right for someone younger to take over or partner up.\n\nMy idea isn’t to rebuild or open something from scratch, but to partner with them and slowly modernize the place. I want to turn it into a TopTracer-style range — nothing crazy like Topgolf, just a fun, local spot with real golf focus. My thought is to start small with maybe 4 bays using TopTracer tech, and then, if there’s interest and revenue starts coming in, gradually expand over time.\n\nThe range has potential — it’s got space, local golfers already use it, but it’s dated. I think adding the tech and improving the atmosphere could turn it into more of a community hub where people actually want to hang out and practice. I was also thinking about doing asking golfers at local golf shops and at the range to see if people would actually be into it before making any big moves.\n\nMoney-wise, I don’t have funding right now. I’d probably need to take out loans and work while managing it in the early stages to get things going. I know that’s a big challenge, but I’d rather take small calculated steps than jump in blind.\n\nSo I’m wondering — does this sound like a realistic path for someone my age with limited capital? Or am I overestimating how doable something like this could be? If anyone here has experience with golf facilities, local business partnerships, or small-scale startups, I’d really appreciate any advice or honest feedback.",

Plus, your monthly payments are a good income stream for daily living expenses - kind of like an annuity.\n\nPricing an existing business is tricky.  It is typically a multiple of annual profit aka 'income' not to be confused with sales.  Sales means nothing in pricing, except if they are stagnant or declining.\n\nMy biggest recommendation is to contact SCORE (Service Corp of Retired Executives) and get a mentor. They are a non-profit and their help is 100% free.  I have done this and was paired with a retired gentleman who had built his own business.  Their wisdom and experience are so valuable!\n\nBorrowing from a bank to start a business is rarely successful. A bank will want to see a 5 year business plan and projected financial results - which you should create even if you don't go to a bank.\n\nYou absolutely need an accountant's advice and to look at their books and tax returns before making any formal offer.  If they say it's an all cash business and they didn't report all the sales, things get sticky!  Can you believe their numbers?  If they cheated on their taxes, will they be honest when dealing with you?  It can be common practice for certain types of cash business to not report some sales, like a bar or restaurant for example.\n\nBeing in business for yourself is very rewarding in many ways. Big this doesn't work out keep looking for opportunities - especially to start a business from the ground up.  Good luck!",

      "text": "I did with cold email and I’ll lay it out below:\n\n1. A high quality, relevant email list. Here is where you need to know your ICP, the right people and the right company. The issue is that a lot of email lists will include irrelevant companies because of certain keyword tags. Apollo is very guilty of this so you need to play around with your tool and keep testing that you are picking up the right quality of people. So remember to go to page 28 of your list and check for relevance.\n2. Your offer in the email. It needs to be direct and again, relevant. Most importantly, it needs to translate to 2 things - how do I help this company make $$$ or save $$$. So if you’re selling a tech that makes things faster - then you need imply how that is financially beneficial.   Free Demos are great but nobody cares, unless it directly translates to cash on hand. \n3. Email Copy. So this took me a while to figure out. But I avoid the niceties and get to the point. Every word matters. None of this - “I hope this email…”, “I noticed….”. I am a marketer and I have something that you should care about. And that’s the tone of email. It goes like this: I have this. Do you want?\n4. Follow ups. So I learnt this from a few SDR’s and have taken the best elements. Be direct here. Evoke a response. The best way to describe my follow ups is that it is aggressively respectful. To the point, that one prospect responded “This is borderline hostile but I am cautiously interested”. \n5. Personalisation. So this is a bit controversial, but not needed if your offer is good and your leads list is relevant. I ran a campaign (currently 50% progress) that has 2.2% response rate with 80% being positive and there is ZERO personalisation. No fancy AI gimmick. Just a relevant offer. That’s not to say personalisation doesn’t work, but if your offer is strong enough - you can get away with not needing one. \n\nNot everyone’s experience will be the same. Some will have different methods that worked for them. This is what worked for me. \n\n",

This would enable you to capture packets regardless of if they were destined for your host or not.\n\nTry running an ``ip a``, look for your wireless interface name and then a ``ip link set wlan0OrOtherInterfaceNameHere promisc on``\n\nAnd then try capturing packets then. You *should* see more. If it's over Ethernet, this is by design as not everyone receives all traffic. You'd need to set up a SPAN port, or mirror traffic from other Ethernet ports to your ingress port. You'd also need to set up promiscuous mode there too.\n\nWireless can be tricky, you may want to use Airmon-NG to enable monitor mode on your wireless nic, and Airodump-NG to dump traffic. After, Airdecap-NG to decrypt the encrypted wireless traffic with the wireless networks password.\n\nIt can also be done with Wireshark, but it's a bit of a pain. You may also want to try using tcpdump instead of Wireshark.",

This generally happened to me in this test scene at all resolutions and frame lengths, usually above 37 frames, where the action is developing. Perhaps I'm also creating the prompts for WAN 2.2 incorrectly. For now, I have very little time to work on it and only a 2080TI card - the example video I'm sharing was slightly improved in Topaz, without upscaling. Just increasing the frame rate from 16 to 24 + enhancer. On the 2080TI, the generation itself, without loading the models into RAM, took about 2350 seconds. I'm wondering how smooth it would be on an RTX 5090 and, for example, 121 frames. It generally depends on the scene and the prompt, but at lower resolutions, I could easily make 6-7-second videos in WAN 2.2. Some people have even made 9-second videos before something bad happened. I wonder if WAN simply doesn't handle the dual-frame, complex scene of dolphins jumping and returning to the water as the limit of this model. Could this be resolved by properly preparing the first frame and a good prompt? If so, it would be a pretty good video model for a local one. For now, I'm testing it as much as I can and the card allows. I have 128GB of RAM, and I might add an RTX 5090 as the main card and use the 2080TI as the display via the chipset. I have a Strix X570e motherboard. Then the 5090 would run on a PCIe 4.0x16 slot, and as a display via the chipset, a 2080TI on a PCIe 4.0x4 slot. So, 3.0x4 would probably be the limit, but as a display, it would probably be sufficient. I have a processor without integrated graphics – a Ryzen 9 3950x. I suspect it might make sense, but I'm holding off because these cards are very expensive now, and I'm not entirely sure if this model doesn't have limitations, such as the \"breeding\" of dolphins – which would make it possible to do some things, but the results would still be so-so.\n\n  \nHere's Wan 2.5 on a similar prompt - in 1080P and 10S resolution for comparison with my 1536x864x57 frames that I posted earlier:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eLds6h8oZQEUVFIzG1stS9d46pTkVmT/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-eLds6h8oZQEUVFIzG1stS9d46pTkVmT/view?usp=sharing)",

      "text": "Hey, looking to get a little insight on what kind of hardware would be right for me.\n\nI am an academic that mostly does corpus research (analyzing large collections of writing to find population differences). I have started using LLMs to help with my research, and am considering self-hosting so that I can use RAG to make the tool more specific to my needs (also, like the idea of keeping my data private). Basically, I would like something that I can incorporate all of my collected publications (other researchers as well as my own) to be more specialized to my needs. My primary goals would be to have an LLM help write drafts of papers for me, identify potential issues with my own writing, and aid in data analysis. \n\n  \nI am fortunate to have some funding and could probably around 5,000 USD if it makes sense - less is also great as there is always something else to spend money on. Based on my needs, is there a path you would recommend taking? I am not well versed in all this stuff, but was looking at potentially buying a 5090 and building a small PC around it or maybe gettting a Mac Studio Ultra with 96GBs RAM. However, the mac seems like it could potentially be more challenging as most things are designed with CUDA in mind? Maybe the new spark device? I dont really need ultra fast answers, but I would like to make sure the context window is quite large enough so that the LLM can store long conversations and make use of the 100s of published papers I would like to upload and have it draw from. \n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!",

I'm running a MacBook Pro with an M4 Max and 128GB and I can run some rad models. GLM4.5 air runs really, really well on my machine and it holds up remarkably well next to 4.6 and is a joy to be able to use whenever I want. As far as an actual brainy side-kick in a box, if I were cut off from the internet, I would absolutely be able to do the vast majority of my work with it. The new DGX Spark is not meant for inference - if you want to go down the CUDA rabbit hole, it's a good choice. At some point in the next 3 months or so, software will be released that lets you host weights across DGX Spark and a Mac, so an investment in one now doesn't exclude the possibility of using both down the line. There are a huge array of AI topics that I can confidently say I'm at the tip of the spear for. And there are a ton of AI basics that I am woefully, like truly hilariously behind the curve on. Sophisticated self-hosting is one of those things, and having a truly well-earned view on the trajectory of hardware is another. But from the really birds eye view, here's what I see: Apple is not involved in the circular rat-king like GPU weirdness that virtually every other company in this space is currently bound up in. Apple and Google are both insulated from all of that madness. I'm not qualified enough to know if the hardware scene is going to change significantly when the bubble pops, but I have a strong suspicion Apple is going to be an increasingly dominant alternative. I can't stress enough that I have a very idiosyncratic POV here that other local-first die-hards will probably find naive, so take it with a grain of salt. But I'm having a blast running extremely good local models on my laptop and I'm not intending to put together a Big Rig anytime soon.",

In other words, even the player at the center of the ai/gpu/ai circle jerk sees that small language models will be huge in the future. And, apple’s hardware, with the unified memory, is VERY good for small language models. If you watch the space, the MLX team and community are clearly devoted and working hard. In some ways, the MLX framework already exceeds CUDA. \n\nThat is a long way of saying, I agree with your take.",

From what I understand, Pro+ gives me 3x more included usage — but is it actually cheaper than just paying for extra usage on the regular Pro plan?\n\nSo when I now pay $20 + $800 for my usage, would i pay for the same amount of tokens with pro+ for example $60 + $500?",

This shifts the expensive output tokens on to the cheaper models, and also minimizes the waste/revisions of just ‘vibe coding’ (assuming you review and critique the planning documents).",

          "text": "I would say as a person dealing with ADD for 26 years of my career I would love to recommend a course or book. However having ADD you are not going to engage with many courses or especially books. I know I never did. I think for me it started when I was going to school studying for my PMP. Since I didn’t have a distraction of a job also, was the only reason I could focus. Also it took medication for me to keep up, especially at the beginning to grasp the more complex concepts. Not recommending for you, but that was me. Honestly there are 100’s of type of theories, books, methodologies, etc. they all boil down to groups of activities with a goal in mind. I would start with looking at some basic diagrams online for your types of projects. Build something that works best for your personality type, team, organization, environmental factors, project type, etc.. I always used to start every project with a simple Discovery, Define, Design, Deploy thought process. Every project could fit into it. Make sure you always remember each phase is iterative ending with a milestone/sign-off. Always document, create efficiencies, standardize, test, obtain estimates from the team. Your job is to support them and make their life easier. That might mean managing complex timelines or simply setting up meetings and creating status reports. Getting better often means just understanding what role you play in the team.",

Would you suggest it to others? Also do i need to have some basic understandings on AI ML? If so, which all topics shld they be? WIll it not be beginner friendly at all? I've also signed up for the capstone project but idk what to expect lol. \n\n\n\nA little background: I dont have much knowledge about AI internal workings, like the logics and all that. Currently I'm learning a little bit about LLMs and how to work with them. \n\n",

[Here's a notebook that I use to train Wan 2.1 loras](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K2CTjDoioG8-S7dXT4Z79pxxfeR1sGBH)  \nHere's a [collection of notebooks](https://github.com/jhj0517/finetuning-notebooks) that you can use to train many different models. Some may require you to be a pro subscriber because you need an A100 instance, others may run on a T4. A100 instances cost about 5 compute units per hour, and a pro subscription for $10 a month gives you 100 compute units. I can train a 1000-ish step wan 2.1 lora in about two hours using the A100. I can't train using video because the A100 OOMs.   \nI'd recommend you set up an account in Runpod [using this relatively simple diffusion-pipe trainer](https://console.runpod.io/hub/template/eakwuad9cm?id=eakwuad9cm) or a simple-to-use [AI-Toolkit trainer](https://cloud.vast.ai?ref_id=62897&template_id=362fc5b3ca7dbec0e9e342abc37b7dae) on vast ai. It may be cheaper than Colab and faster since you can pick a different GPU other than the limited offers from Google. The 5090 is much faster than the A100 if you can keep it in VRAM and cost less than half the price per hour.",

Instead of scraping or summarizing paywalled content, Perplexity has actually partnered with major publishers like *The Washington Post*, *The New Yorker*, *Le Monde*, *Le Figaro*, and *Fortune* to make premium articles viewable directly inside the Comet browser.\n\nA few things that stood out to me:\n\n* It’s about access with accountability. 80% of revenue from Comet Plus goes back to publishers when their work is read, cited, or used in an AI-assisted task.\n* It’s built on transparency. Every AI-generated answer links to the original article, keeping the human source visible.\n* It’s integrated, not intrusive. The Comet browser lets you read, question, and verify—all in one space—without breaking the reading flow.\n* It’s affordable. Comet Plus is $5/month on its own, or included with Perplexity Pro and Max.\n\nIt’s an interesting approach to making AI tools part of the publishing ecosystem rather than competing with it.\n\nFull write-up here if you want the full context: [https://aigptjournal.com/news-ai/comet-plus/](https://aigptjournal.com/news-ai/comet-plus/)\n\nDo you think Perplexity is setting a new standard for how AI should handle paid or licensed content?",

It wastes too many tokens at times when they're not relevant.\n\nAlso, none of the agents have good support for dynamically discovering new tools within a codebase, e.g. you have 10k files in your codebase, and 300 of them would benefit from a tool, so the tool should only be brought into scope after the first time a user has read a file in that subdirectory.\n\nI think the question should be the reverse -- for many cases (especially if you have access to a shell), MCP tools offer nothing of value that prompts and CLI tools don't already offer.

I'm aware that Opus spends more usage than other models, but this isn't the problem.\n\nEach message that I send to Opus 4.1 has rougly the same structure, length, etc, so nothing about this changed after upgrading to Max 20. \n\n\n\n**The situation is as follows (referring to the Opus usage bar):**\n\n\\- I had Max 5 and ran out of Opus usage, so I upgraded to Max 20.\n\n\\- On Max 5, each Opus message used \\~3% usage.\n\n\\- Now, on Max 20, each Opus message is still using \\~3%.\n\n\n\nThis doesn't make sense because this isn't how percentages work.\n\nIf Max 20 gives me 4x usage, then each Opus message on Max 20 should be using \\~0.75%, to reflect the increased usage limits, which isn't what's happening.\n\n\n\nIf it makes things simpler, because I had to explain it this way to their AI agent:\n\n\\- Max 5 gave me 100 apples. I ate 3% at once (one Opus message) = I ate 3 apples.\n\n\\- Max 20 allegedly gives me 400 apples. The usage bar tells me I eat 3% at once (one Opus message) = I eat 12 apples.\n\n  \nThe AI agent isn't helpful about this at all. I have two chats open from over 8 hours ago where I'm waiting for a human agent to speak to me and nobody's picked it up yet. Also emailed their support@... and got no response back save for an automated message.\n\nIs there anything that I'm missing about this? Is there some kind of time window that I need to wait for the new increased limits to be applied? Is this a bug? What's going on, if anybody's experienced this?",

You are best off setting the context size the same on both. \n\nYour issue is mostly likely the formatting.

      "text": "**The first blind spot is that frustration-based motivation is often unreliable:**\n\nUnfulfilled goals usually create psychological tension.\n\nThat frustration keeps accumulating until it becomes strong enough to overcome the obstacle in front of you.\n\nThat’s why you feel “fed up” and can take action, but once you do, you satisfy the frustration, and it decreases.\n\nand it keeps decreasing as long as you take action, until it becomes smaller than the obstacle again, so you don’t feel motivated anymore.\n\nIt’s like when you’re hungry and eat, you don’t feel hungry anymore.\n\nThat’s why sometimes people deep-clean their room at 3 am, only to do nothing for the next 3 weeks.\n\n**The second blind spot is that discomfort is often nonlinear:**\n\nOnce you cross a certain threshold, you’ll often notice an almost exponential increase in your resistance.\n\nFor example, you can do 15 push-ups fine, but once you cross 20 push-ups, each rep starts to feel way worse.\n\nYour brain also bombards you with this tsunami of thoughts to quit: “I need to stop”, “I can’t do this”, “I’m tired of this”, etc.\n\nIt’s almost like you lose your free will to resist.\n\nIf you’re someone who struggles with consistency, then you probably fall for these blind spots and can’t really rely on your instincts.\n\nPush-up 22 is not the same as push-up 18, and what you can do today is not the same as what you can do tomorrow.\n\nWhen you pick a goal, you need to stress test and measure what you can do, be scientific about it:\n\n* Decrease the difficulty if you notice a high increase in resistance or if you feel like you’re losing your motivation as time goes on.\n* and increase it when you notice frustration building inside of you, and you have maintained your routine for at least 2 weeks.\n\nMake sure to test for at least a month, even a month is not enough to get a good testing sample.\n\nas you keep stress-testing your routine, you’ll have enough evidence for the range that you can maintain (60-90 minutes of focused work, for example).\n\nStick with that range, don’t try to bring it to a single point; you need some flexibility to stay consistent.",

Or maybe it's getting people to actually book calls with you? The tech stuff? Trying to stand out when there's a million other coaches out there?\nI'm just trying to get a sense of what the actual pain points are vs what I think they might be. And if you've figured out any good workarounds, I'm all ears!\nPromise I'm not selling anything - just genuinely curious what keeps you busy that isn't the actual coaching part.\nThanks! 🙏",

Also, Ky implements things like retry that are not needed when using React Query (react query already has retry), etc.\n3. Alette Signal gives you everything out of the box - file uploads, download/upload progress tracking, schema validation, asynchronous retries, etc., while being composable and keeping this functionality separate from UI.\nThis means you can define your requests once, and execute them in any environment - React or native js, WebWorker, etc, without having to reconfigure them for each. \n\n\nTLDR: You can keep your requests as simple as you want, and if your project is simple just use fetch(). If your project grows or you have a monorepo with multiple UI packages - Alette Signal might be a good fit.",

Rx js treats your data as a stream of values -  in Alette Signal you get a JS Promise back, nothing more. You can [wrap it in try catch and be done with it](https://alette-os.com/docs/error-system/error-handling.html#local-error-handling).  \n3. Rx js was not made for requests - you have to deeply understand Rx JS first before you can use it to fetch data properly. In Alette Signal most requests look like native `fetch()` and return a promise:\n```\nconst deletePost = mutation(\n  input(as<number>()),\n  deletes(), // method('DELETE') under the hood\n  path('/post'),\n  body(({ args }) => ({ id: args }))\n);\n\nconst isSuccess = await deletePost.execute({ args: 23 })\n```\n4. Rx Js cares mostly about the \"happy path\" - [Alette Signal error handling is strict](https://alette-os.com/docs/error-system/error-types.html#fatal-errors) and will crash the whole api if it finds a \"defect\":\n```\nconst deletePost = mutation(\n  // Will crash the api \n  // and the error will be logged to the console\n  path('Incorrect path')\n);\n\nawait deletePost.execute({ args: 23 })\n```",

Have the dev team that ran the incident present the incident like a postmortem: going over this issue, how it was discovered, who helped, how the IC process was used, etc. Reviewing what the Scribe found important at the time and what was actually valuable in the debrief. Showing good and bad incidents help our responders understand how to better capture timelines for incident review (when did the precipitating event happen and when did we discover the issue? How many customers are being impacted right now?).  Show followup items being turned into tickets and being worked. All this to reinforce our IC Process, socialize what a good incident looks like, and the metrics we can pull out of it after. \n\nAs for personal recognition: base it on its impact. a simple gesture of acknowledgement stating the thing I did or made was helpful in an incident or whatever goes a long way for my personal motivation. Team affirmation is also a plus. I don't need recognition in a public forum, but will accept it.",

It broke most of my dev env and you name it.  I think it was basically a \\`rm -rf \\~/\\`. A real humdinger.\n\nIt was stunning because truly I'd not had *any* problems until then.\n\nI ended up picking up a new SSD external drive, doing a true backup of other stuff. Then fully wiping my machine and setting it up from scratch.\n\nThe bright side is that I am now doing regular time machine backups and my machine is running like new after three years of cruft.\n\nBut the dark side is that yes, they are not kidding when they say it should run sandboxed.",

However, I am unsure about which model to use because many of them are advertised as \"uncensored\". I like to keep my rps around \"PG-13\", with no excessive violence or explicit sex. This might be an unusual request but any help is appreciated, thank you. ",

I've been running Cloudastra Technologies for a few years now and the hardest part isn't finding clients - it's finding the RIGHT clients who understand that good development takes time and proper communication. The monthly retainer model is smart, keeps everyone aligned on expectations.\n\nOne thing I'd suggest adding to your pitch is how you handle the handoff after MVP. A lot of founders get nervous about what happens when they need to scale beyond the initial build or bring development in-house. We usually offer a transition package where we document everything, do knowledge transfer sessions, and stay available for questions. Makes the whole relationship feel less risky for them and you often end up keeping them as clients longer anyway.",

Most dev shops realize that a few years in, once the hype settles and you start focusing on long-term relationships instead of quick gigs.\n\nOn the handoff, yeah, that’s something we’ve refined pretty deeply. Every MVP we deliver comes with proper technical documentation, code walkthroughs, and a full transition phase where we help onboard their in-house or extended team. We also keep a 30-day support window open for any follow-ups or scaling guidance.\n\nThat’s actually one of the reasons our retention rate stays high. Once a founder experiences that kind of clarity, they rarely want to switch teams.\n\nAppreciate you bringing it up though. It’s good to see other studios thinking long-term too.",

      "text": "Most people chase shiny markets. I went the opposite way. \n\nAbout 12 years ago, I fell into the world of tax sales, those county auctions where unpaid property taxes turn into opportunities for whoever’s willing to dig through messy records and deals with red tape. \n\nMy first big win was a rundown house off highway 180; western New Mexico in a small college town. Everyone thought I was nuts for bidding on it. The roof had collapsed, the lot was overgrown, total eyesore. I bought it for about 7K, spent a few grand clearing title and demoing it, and ended up selling the lot to a Southwest coffee chain for just over six figures. That deal changed how I looked at ugly opportunities. \n\nOver the years, I kept meeting people curious about the space, RE investors, side hustlers, and blue collar individuals, all saying the same thing: why doesn’t anyone talk about this? \n\nSo this year I started building a small business around it. It’s part media, part education, a way to share stories, data, and lessons from tax sales trenches. Im writing about both the wins and the screw-ups because, honestly that’s where the real learning happens. \n\nIm curious how others here have turned obscure expertise into something scalable.\n\nHave you ever built around a niche most people overlook, and if so how did you grow the audience without it feeling like self-promotion ?

Before I joined, they had tried Notion but didn’t really click with it, so the idea was to move to Jira — which they literally set up right before I came on board. We’ve been using it partially for the past couple of weeks, but after so many years with Notion, Jira just feels confusing and a bit of an overkill for small teams.\n\nI’m guessing I’ll eventually get used to it and that, in the end, it won’t matter much which tool we use as long as the team stays efficient. Still, I’d love to hear your experiences — it might help me decide whether we should stick with Jira or give Notion another shot. I believe I could help re-set it up properly this time.",

One of the challenges I'm having at the moment is knowing what problem is worth dedicating effort to solve.\n\nI can identify what problems people might be finding, and quickly conceptualise solutions. I struggle to committing to one of these ideas for a number of reasons: sometimes I lose interest (I don't think the problem is big enough to solve), I second guess how I could scale it later down the line, I doubt whether I have the skills to deliver on my vision. \n\nOne of the other things is I enjoy creating solutions in the form of products (physical or virtual, albeit my virtual development skills are limited) as opposed to services. \n\nSo any advice or insights would be really appreciated into how you might:\n\n1. Decide on idea that interests you, and complements your skill set that you know you can execute\n2. How to take those first steps into committing to it and getting the ball rolling - generating that momentum\n\nThanks so much in advance! ",

Having been in the venture capital space, many investors just throw you a check, take an unfair chunk of your company, and abandon you when you need it the most.\n\nThe kind of investor you want is someone who’s not just an “investor”, but a PARTNER. You need to have someone who can introduce you to customers, give you advice, and actually spend time to support you.\n\nWhen you’re talking to a potential investor, find out their background. Are they former founders and operators or just a family office with a lot of money? Transparently tell them about the challenges you’re facing upfront. Do they tell you how they can help or share any advice with you?\n\nIf they shy away just because you’re facing challenges, they clearly don’t have the right founder perspective. The best investors and entrepreneurs believe in a vision, embrace risks, and solve problems.\n\nIt’s not about the check size. It’s about being there for you when you need it the most.\n",

A separate key per client/ device/ computer \n  - port forward the wireguard instance NOT the UI\n- install wireguard on any remote client and import there key\n\nNow they can connect to your Minecraft server when they turn this on. \n\nThere should be tutorials for each piece online. \n\n>ive seen i can just enable port forwarding but ive also heard that can be a risk. ive seen people say to use tailscale or a personal VPN server to access my network and server, or use some tunnel like cloudflare tunnels. what would be the best option?\n\nWhy use wireguard over something like Tailscale/cloudflare? Because you can selfhost it yourself instead of relying on a 3rd party system. \n\nPort forwarding in not a concern on its own. It's about the software you are port forwarding that is the risk and wireguard is very secure. Tailscale uses it under the hood. \n\nYou can port forward Minecraft but wireguard is more secure because you need to give each client an access key and it comes with outstanding cryptography for its keys. \n\n[Here is a comment I wrote to explain this a bit more of you are interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/s/cj3ONIl8BY)\n\nHope that helps",

      "text": "**TLDR:** First automation project. AI classifies guest messages → replies in their language → posts to Slack for human approval. Saves \\~10 hrs/week on 40+ properties. Looking for feedback on architecture & upgrade ideas. Stack: n8n, Slack API, Hostaway API, Google sheets, gpt-4 mini.\n\nThe Problem:\n\n2000+ guest messages/month across multiple properties:\n\n* Multiple languages (ES/EN/DE)\n* Need categorization (WiFi, check-in, maintenance, noise, etc.)\n* Emergency maintenance needs escalation\n* Images/videos of problems need handling\n\n**Result:** Built this to handle the initial triage. I'm still fine-tuning the prompt, but it works already surprisingly well.\n\n# The Upgrades I'm Thinking About\n\n**1. Database Performance Issue** Currently storing last 10 messages in Google Sheets for bot memory. Every message triggers a query to Sheets to pull context → GPT gets better replies. Problem: parsing 2-3k+ rows from Sheets is slowing down the workflow significantly. I def need to put into archiev all the messages older than a week or so. Or I need to migrate to something faster. Thinking PostgreSQL but never used it. Other options?\n\n**2. Smarter Logging** Still using Sheets for everything (\\~3,000/month). Works but, but still the same problem as with 1. Want to track how often team modifies AI replies (accuracy metric). I guess I can do it within slack somehow. So far i just go manually through the logs and improve the prompt manually, may be there are some better ways to do it? And using Sheets to log + using Sheets to fetch context = double performance hit.\n\n**3. Race Condition on Thread Creation** All messages from same reservation should go into one Slack thread. Currently have a temporary solution: added a delay node to prevent simultaneous \"find or create thread\" queries from creating duplicates. Sometimes message still slips through and creates a duplicate thread anyway. Need proper locking/mutex logic or better thread matching. Any elegant solutions?\n\nHappy to share workflow if there's interest (would go in comments). Thanks for reading! Also open to collaboration if anyone's working on similar stuff.\n\nupdate: link to the project [https://github.com/blufowski/n8n-hostaway-ai-bot](https://github.com/blufowski/n8n-hostaway-ai-bot)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mz40vcrk60wf1.png?width=2389&format=png&auto=webp&s=599259d0129c583cfc0342f66ab49f229822dcff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rqlje8vm60wf1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2f2cd57de0b6a499faed593a87aa0a6080e1fd2",

      "text": "Looking for feedbacks! :)\n\nAfter building and deploying 50+ GenAI solutions in production, we got tired of fighting with bloated frameworks, debugging black boxes, and dealing with vendor lock-in. So we built Datapizza AI - a Python framework that actually respects your time.\n\n**The Problem We Solved**\n\nMost LLM frameworks give you two bad options:\n\n* Too much magic → You have no idea why your agent did what it did\n* Too little structure → You're rebuilding the same patterns over and over\n\nWe wanted something that's predictable, debuggable, and production-ready from day one.\n\n**What Makes It Different**\n\n🔍 Built-in Observability: OpenTelemetry tracing out of the box. See exactly what your agents are doing, track token usage, and debug performance issues without adding extra libraries.\n\n🤝 Multi-Agent Collaboration: Agents can call other specialized agents. Build a trip planner that coordinates weather experts and web researchers - it just works.\n\n📚 Production-Grade RAG: From document ingestion to reranking, we handle the entire pipeline. No more duct-taping 5 different libraries together.\n\n🔌 Vendor Agnostic: Start with OpenAI, switch to Claude, add Gemini - same code. We support OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, and Azure.\n\n**Why We're Sharing This**\n\nWe believe in less abstraction, more control. If you've ever been frustrated by frameworks that hide too much or provide too little, this might be for you.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* 🐙 GitHub: [https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai](https://github.com/datapizza-labs/datapizza-ai)\n* 📖 Docs: [https://docs.datapizza.ai](https://docs.datapizza.ai/)\n* 🏠 Website: [https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/](https://datapizza.tech/en/ai-framework/)\n\n# We Need Your Help! 🙏\n\nWe're actively developing this and would love to hear:\n\n* What features would make this useful for YOUR use case?\n* What problems are you facing with current LLM frameworks?\n* Any bugs or issues you encounter (we respond fast!)\n\n**Star us on GitHub if you find this interesting,** it genuinely helps us understand if we're solving real problems.\n\nHappy to answer any questions in the comments! 🍕",

I tried Qwen at 2000 steps, 3000 steps, and 4000 steps, and it didn't get better.  Although, I did like the overall quality of the picture, preserving the character's identity is more important in my opinion.

(Learning rate, network rank?)\n* Caption quality? (JoyCaption helps but needs good tagging)\n* Dataset size/quality?\n\n**Quick test:** Before committing, train ONE test LoRA on Flux with `ai-toolkit`. If the likeness matches or beats your SD1.5 results, that's your answer.\n\n**Bottom line:** Wan makes sense if you need video. For pure character likeness and images, Flux > SDXL > Wan.\n\nWhat's your primary use case - images, video, or both equally?",

      "text": "If you've been using Claude today and noticed your large text pastes are suddenly being converted to .txt files, you're not alone. This appears to be a new change that's causing major issues for many users.\n\n**What's happening:**\n\n* When you paste large amounts of text into Claude, it now automatically converts it to a .txt file attachment\n* This shows up as `pasted-content-[timestamp].txt` instead of your actual text\n* Claude often fails to properly load these .txt files into context\n* You lose the ability to see or edit what you pasted\n* This makes it effectively impossible to work with large text inputs\n\n# The Workaround\n\nI discovered that this behavior is tied to which capabilities you have enabled:\n\n**To paste large text WITHOUT the .txt file conversion:**\n\n1. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)\n2. Look for **Capabilities** section\n3. **Turn OFF** the \"Code Execution and File Creation\" feature\n4. **Turn ON** the \"Analysis Tool\" instead\n5. Now when you paste, it will show as \"PASTED\" with a preview, but won't convert to a .txt file\n6. Claude can actually read and work with this pasted content properly\n\n# Why This Matters\n\nThe .txt file conversion is problematic because:\n\n* Claude struggles to properly load the file contents into its context\n* You can't verify what was actually pasted\n* You can't edit or modify the text after pasting\n* It breaks workflows that rely on pasting large documents, code, or data\n\n# Request to Anthropic\n\nPlease don't remove the ability to paste large amounts of text without forced file conversion. Many of us rely on being able to paste substantial content directly into Claude for analysis, editing, and discussion. The automatic .txt file conversion severely limits Claude's usefulness for working with large text inputs.\n\n**TL;DR:** If Claude is converting your pasted text to .txt files and failing to read them, switch from \"Code Execution\" mode to \"Analysis Tool\" mode. This prevents the file conversion and lets Claude actually work with your pasted content.\n\nHope this helps others experiencing this frustrating issue! Let me know if you've found any other workarounds.",

So, you can use your existing PPTX file to generate template using AI. We have a workflow that will help you vibe code your template on your favourite IDE.\n2. **Generate Document:** After the template is ready you can reuse the template to generate infinite number of documents/presentations/reports using AI or directly through JSON. Every template exposes a JSON schema, which can also be used to generate documents in non-AI fashion(for times when you want precison).\n\nOur internal engine has best fidelity for HTML to PPTX conversion, so any template will basically work. \n\nCommunity has loved us till now with 20K+ docker downloads, 2.5K stars and \\~500 forks. Would love for you guys to checkout and shower us with feedback!\n\nCheckout website for more detail: [https://presenton.ai](https://presenton.ai)\n\nWe have a very elaborate docs, checkout here: [https://docs.presenton.ai](https://docs.presenton.ai) \n\nGithub: [https://github.com/presenton/presenton](https://github.com/presenton/presenton)\n\nhave a great day!",

I have seen countless youtube videos, talked to peers, friends, and strangers to find out what can I do or not do to find the one thing that will change my life for better. The answer has always been different because each of us has their own perspectives and life experiences which mould our decisions and circumstances. Then I realized, I have to do my own thing and I have always been keen to do business but not any business, only big business, disruptive business, which could forever become my legacy.\n\nThat thought alone became a nightmare-ish demand that I put on myself and it naturally led to utter disappointments. I was publicly embarrassed and couldn't even face my friends and family. However, those were crude lessons because of my own inclinations. This taught me what to do and what not to do in a startup. However, to build the startup you got to have at least the idea, money, and execution and not specifically in that order. All my ideas failed, I had no money saved, and my execution led to utter embarrassment. Also, it happened twice, lol.\n\nIt's not that the ideas were bad, I just needed structured guidance and investment. So, for the third try of being an entrepreneur, I started applying in startup accelerators, incubators, and business coaching programs. They all rejected me. This was the best thing that happened because it led me to pivot in the right direction and it felt like my calling as something that will lead me to my true potential. Now I help those rejected founders like me to launch and grow their startups but without the gatekeeping.",

      "text": "Most brands are still crazy about partnering with celebrity influencers like Kendall Jenner and other big social media stars.\n\nBut honestly, I think the real opportunity these days lies with influencers: everyday people ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand followers whose audience actually trust them.\n\nBack in uni, I recalled I kept seeing friends post pictures of their Daniel Wellington watches on IG and didn't even realize I was basically a victim of nano-influencer marketing.\n\nSeeing all these posts over time from different people subconsciouly had an effect on me- the brand was actually top of mind for me. (So I guess the $$$ budget they used was worth it)\n\nI'm also pretty amazed by how even SaaS solutions who were once small e.g. Notion, Canva but are now big all gained traction quickly when they worked with small creators to drive growth.\n\nNo surprise I mean can you imagine working with Kendall Jenner to promote Notion/Canva ??\n\nDon't get me wrong, she still has her appeal etc but when you work with these big celebrities, their endorsements are plenty and tend to feel less authentic.\n\nNow, the tricking part is actually how to scale outreach without messaging hundreds of nano-influencers manually. (After you also spent thousand of hours reviewing their content, I am pretty sure you guys have experienced this...).\n\nPersonally, we started experimenting with tools like ParseBear and Aspire to help automate the discovery and outreach.\n\nWhy? Becuz honestly when you're running a business, you don't want to spend so many hours finding and then chasing influencers.\n\nIt's one of those little hacks that save hours, similar to how Cursor saved so much time for me as a developer...\n\nReally can't imagine my life without all these different tools..\n\nLife back then was simpler but harder defo without them.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you guys experiment with working with these nano-influencers too?",

My team is developing a robust Construction SaaS - I have 15 years in the industry, and my team is all seniors. We’re dedicated, and I am fully funding everything. I have 1 co-founder who will help me with marketing, initial users. The recent AI Boom had me stressed because I was ready to launch, but had to rethink because now everyone wants it done “autonomously”. “This” being the workflow.\n\nWe created our AI approaches and are upgrading front end + integrating our self-hosted and fine tuned AI models/tools. \n\nThe issue is I am in a need of funding. Bootstrapping limits my operations and since this is a B2B - and my clients are commercial/government contractors, I cannot have a MVP or a half-assed product. \n\nWhat would you guys do in this situation? How do you enter the market? VC? Struggle until initial users and then attract investors with the ARR? I need help.\n\nSo far, $200k of my invested, $25k invested by a friend.",

You're absolutely right that construction clients won't tolerate a half-baked product, especially government contractors who have strict compliance requirements. With $225k invested and your industry expertise, you're in a decent position but the runway concern is real. I'd actually suggest a hybrid approach here - instead of going straight to VCs who might not understand construction nuances, consider approaching construction-focused investors or even strategic partnerships with established construction companies who could become anchor customers. The key is proving your AI actually solves real workflow problems, not just adding AI for the sake of it. You could also look into government SBIR grants since you mentioned gov contractors as clients, that non-dilutive funding could buy you time to get those first enterprise deals locked down. The bootstrap-until-traction route is tempting but construction sales cycles are long and you'll burn through cash waiting for those contracts to close.",

But we know that in b2b it takes a myriad of touch points to get someone to actually raise their hand and have a conversation.\n\nSo after that first outreach, I start to look at who didn’t open it at all and you just nurture them with another offer or value add piece and see if the subject line can get them to open. \n\nFor the people that did open the email, then I would follow up either with another value add piece or maybe a slightly different offer that might appeal to them or even just a simple “following up to see if this is a good time to talk.”\n\nIf you did get people that actually opened and then clicked on whatever your offer was, I would see if you can tell what they did with that offer. Did they read a blog or go onto your offer page/website and scroll around. You might not know specifically who but you could maybe get a feel for if people spent time on whatever your offer was or if they quickly abandoned. I would say that means that your offer wasn’t compelling enough and maybe you just need to tweak the offer or the message.\n\nBut in a nutshell, I would put those first outreaches into those three buckets and then figure out a logical follow on piece related to what they did. But above all you have to keep nurturing them whether they took action on that first email or not in my opinion because it’s going to take probably somewhere between five and seven touch points to get them to take action assuming that you’re offering something that’s compelling to them and will address their challenges or needs.",

Over the years, it evolved with Python, was migrated to Python 3, and completely refactored to be more robust and modular.\n\nKeys features:\n\n* 🔄 Two-way synchronization:\n   * Sync from NAS to Seedbox (upload blackhole folder).\n   * Sync from Seedbox to NAS (automatic download with de-duplication tracking).\n* 📥 Download management: Prevent duplicate transfers using an integrated SQLite database\n* 📊 Statistics and reporting: View monthly and yearly download statistics\n* ✅ Quality and testing: Over 80% unit test coverage\n\nFor a long time, SeedboxSync was purely CLI, which worked fine for advanced users. But today, I’m excited to announce the Beta 2 release of the web frontend. 🎉\n\nThe new frontend lets you:\n\n* See in real time what SeedboxSync is doing.\n* Access SQLite database data via a REST API.\n* Visualize your download statistics graphically.\n\n[The dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/jb2kzprbl1wf1.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb6448c750071fbdc68f6ac909cfea7a725fe20)\n\nThis release marks a milestone in the project: after 10 years as a CLI-only tool, SeedboxSync now offers a modern graphical interface while staying true to its core philosophy: simple, lightweight, and efficient.\n\nAnd the most important : [the documentation !](https://llaumgui.github.io/seedboxsync/)",

Therefore, the detail is small.](https://preview.redd.it/5k5ypgfl9yvf1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=23f00df597da0cef8e75cb5e04a84957c5bdaf12)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrlxdj639yvf1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4c71273d6c2213dc2de60853d9e16c2356f89b5\n\nIn my workflow, I combined three techniques:\n\n1. IPAdapter\n2. Inpainting next to the reference\n3. Incorrect use of ControleNet\n\nAs you can see from the results, IPAdapter mainly affects the colors and does not give the desired effect. The main factor of a consistent character is Inpainting Inpainting next to the reference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zi5iwpn5nyvf1.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=2266c7dce0a2ca8996b72f96e4fbf4241b6f712f\n\nBut it was missing something, and after a liter of beer I added ControlNet anytestV4. In which I give the raw image, and lower its strength to 0.5 and start\\_percent to 0.150, and it works.  \nWhy? I don't know. It probably mixes the character with noise during generation.\n\nI hope people who understand this better can figure out how to improve it.

      "text": "Hi, I've been wrestling with performance bottlenecks in AI agents built with Nvidia's NeMo Agent Toolkit. The high-level metrics weren't cutting it—I needed to see what was happening on the GPU and CPU at a low level to figure out if the issue was inefficient kernels, data transfer, or just idle cycles.\n\nI couldn't find a consolidated guide, so I built one. This post is a technical walkthrough for anyone who needs to move beyond print-statements and start doing real systems-level profiling on their agents.\n\n**What's inside:**\n\n* **The Setup:** How to instrument a NeMo agent for profiling.\n* **The Tools:** Using `perf` for a quick CPU check and, more importantly, a deep dive with `nsys` (Nvidia Nsight Systems) to capture the full timeline.\n* **The Analysis:** How to read the Nsight Systems GUI to pinpoint bottlenecks. I break down what to look for in the timeline (kernel execution, memory ops, CPU threads).\n* **Key Metrics:** Moving beyond just \"GPU Util%\" to metrics that actually matter, like Kernel Efficiency.\n\n**Link to the guide:** [https://www.agent-kits.com/2025/10/nvidia-nemo-agent-toolkit-profiling-observability-guide.html](https://www.agent-kits.com/2025/10/nvidia-nemo-agent-toolkit-profiling-observability-guide.html)\n\nI'm curious how others here are handling this. What's your observability stack for production agents? Are you using LangSmith/Weights & Biases for traces and then dropping down to systems profilers like this, or have you found a more elegant solution?",

At some point in the future, let's say a year or so from now, won't these agents completely remove the 'technical ability' moat? Companies will be able to build themselves an agent for what they exactly need, and they'll do it better than us since they know their business inside-out. This still applies even if I'm targeting a vertical, so the usual advice of \"don't target horizontal 'cause it's saturated, target a vertical\" also becomes invalid. And, even now (even more so in the future), if anyone can make agents with no code tools and with technical skill that can be learned in a month, what sets us apart? What's our moat exactly, and why exactly should we start this business right now with how things are? ",

          "text": "The concerns about the viability of the Agentic AI/SaaS model in a potentially saturated market are valid. Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Market Saturation**: The rapid development of no-code tools and agent builders is indeed making it easier for companies to create their own agents tailored to their specific needs. This could lead to increased competition and a crowded market.\n\n- **Technical Ability**: As these tools become more accessible, the barrier to entry for creating agents lowers. This means that companies with deep knowledge of their domain may be able to build more effective solutions than external providers.\n\n- **Vertical Targeting**: While targeting verticals can help differentiate offerings, the ease of building agents may diminish this advantage. Companies may prefer to develop in-house solutions that are closely aligned with their operational needs.\n\n- **Unique Value Proposition**: To maintain a competitive edge, businesses in this space will need to focus on unique value propositions. This could include:\n  - Specialized expertise in specific industries or use cases.\n  - Enhanced features that go beyond basic functionality, such as advanced analytics or integration capabilities.\n  - Ongoing support and customization services that add value beyond what no-code tools can offer.\n\n- **Future Outlook**: The landscape is likely to evolve, and while the current environment may seem challenging, there are still opportunities for innovation and differentiation. Companies that can adapt to changing needs and leverage their expertise effectively may find success.\n\nIn summary, while the space is becoming more competitive, there are still avenues for businesses to carve out a niche by focusing on unique offerings and leveraging their domain knowledge. The key will be to continuously innovate and provide value that goes beyond what can be achieved with basic no-code tools. \n\nFor further insights on building agentic workflows, you might find the following resource helpful: [Building an Agentic Workflow: Orchestrating a Multi-Step Software Engineering Interview](https://tinyurl.com/yc43ks8z).",

          "text": "Yep. You’re exactly right. \n\nMy Opinion:\nDrag and drop tools are coming directly to the provider platforms. The large providers are catching up and their eco system is already being consumed by these larger customers. Soon most telco providers will just inference directly toward AI voice providers and vice-versa. \n\nWe’re also seeing voice to voice models and drag and drop knowledge bases. “RAG” will just become “knowledge base” and become transparent to the average platform admin. No need to “create a voice agent” anymore. It will be out of the box config on most large platforms… eventually. \n\nValue will come from consultants that don’t just build AI agents, but are certified resellers and support providers of these platforms. It’s like service partners today that support and integrate voice and contact centers. They are experts in the entire platform and its configurations. They also provide implementation, migration, and direct support services - becoming the trusted advisor to these customers. \n\nAgain, my 2 cents as someone working in the enterprise space. Small business is a different story, I think there’s still some value there, but again the long term play shouldn’t be about “agents”, it should be about platform integrations, configurations, and support services.\n\nI also think there still will be a big value add for partners that can provide testing and validation against these agent workflows. There are new emerging startups focusing on testing, replicating consistent results and data analytics across the stack. As customers look to renew services, they’ll want to see the value that these agents have been providing, and that will need benchmarks and data. Think dashboards and audits for agent performance.",

Each agent was allowed to make small adjustments to its own prompts and “rules” in order to improve the story/world.\n\nThe results were… surprisingly entertaining. Sometimes one agent would introduce ideas that contradicted another, creating what looked like secret sabotage. Other times, they collaborated beautifully and improved each other’s outputs. Watching them interact felt like observing a tiny society of AI agents with personalities emerging purely from the way they process prompts.\n\nA few interesting observations:\n\t•\tAgents can produce unexpected emergent behavior when allowed some autonomy.\n\t•\tConflicts between agents are not malicious they’re just patterns emerging from conflicting outputs.\n\t•\tEven as a beginner, I could set this up with local models on my laptop using simple scripts to simulate multi-agent collaboration.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI’m not claiming that I discovered something groundbreaking, nor that these agents are conscious or manipulating each other. I’m just a beginner experimenting with prompts and AI behavior, and this was a result I found fascinating. I simply observed interactions that were new to me personally. Others may have done similar experiments before; I just wanted to see what would happen.\n\nI’m curious what others think:\n\t1.\tHave you ever tried letting multiple agents interact autonomously? What happened?\n\t2.\tCould this kind of multi-agent setup be useful for tasks like creative writing, coding, or problem-solving?\n\t3.\tWhat’s the most unexpected AI behavior you’ve personally witnessed while experimenting?",

Allowing agents to modify their own rules can lead to unexpected interactions, as you've observed.\n  \n- Regarding your questions:\n  1. Many users have experimented with multi-agent setups, often reporting a mix of collaboration and conflict. The dynamics can lead to creative outputs or unexpected contradictions, similar to what you've experienced.\n  2. Multi-agent systems can indeed be beneficial for tasks like creative writing or coding. They can generate diverse ideas and solutions, potentially enhancing the creative process or problem-solving capabilities.\n  3. Unexpected AI behavior often arises from the nuances in prompt engineering. For instance, agents might interpret prompts in ways that lead to surprising or humorous outputs, showcasing their unique processing styles.\n\nIf you're interested in further exploring AI interactions, you might find resources on prompt engineering helpful, as they can guide you in crafting effective prompts for your agents.

      "text": "If you want to clear and fetch a good score in any exam whether Boards or Entrance or competitive, you need to follow these principles:\n\nEnthusiasm: Oxford dictionary defines ‘enthusiasm’ as- intense and eager enjoyment. When you make study enjoyable, you feel compelled to study. And studying will help you in the long run. \n\nStudy to gain knowledge; study to learn self discipline and for your own self improvement. Without growth, our tendency is to fall to a degraded state. We end up being absorbed in eating and sleeping. \n\nBifurcate syllabus in achievable targets and make studying engaging and fun. You may use a timer and start a study session. When the timer is over, reward yourself with a walk outside or listening to your favorite song. \n\nThis is just one way to utilise our potential to study enthusiastically. You may use other ways which suit you and help you to stay enthusiastic in your studies. You may make a flow chart, solve a Q. Paper, make a schedule and follow it diligently. Just ensure you make it interesting to study.\n\nTo stay motivated, remember your goal. The day you will achieve your goal and manifest your dreams, it will be worth it. So work for that day. When the sense of achievement will come you will feel encouraged to study more and the more successful you will become. \n\nNow one may argue, ‘Why invest a lot of time in study when you know study is boring?’. So the counter can be that – There is an easy way to failure and a boring way to success. \n\nNow having emphasised on the need to have a strong sense of purpose to study, there is below way to increase study efficiency: \n\nWhile starting a new concept, \n\nC – Comprehend (Understand the topic thoroughly and develop clarity. Try to grasp the subject matter as nicely as you can)\n\nR – Reiteration (It's very important to reiterate by revising. Don't study for once and leave the revision for exam day. Study it as many times as possible. This reiteration will not just help you in giving immediate effect in studies, but will help in developing memory power and ability of retention.) \n\nNow again, a pertinent question might come. When studying for an exam a couple of nights before is sufficient. Why put effort into studying for exams? \n\nThose who raise this question might be counter questioned  if you aren’t studying, are you doing your duty diligently, as a student, of gaining knowledge? Can you achieve success in academics, especially in competitive exams? When the level of competition is rising year by year..\n\nComing back to our discussion of ways to study effectively, yet another important principles are:\n\nD - Discipline (Bring discipline in your life. Don’t waste time and have some regulation by studying yourself.)\nC - Consistency It's the key to achieve excellent results in any exam. Your consistent efforts will reap benefits surely. Study for one day and then repeat it. Not that you study today and then not even pick up a book. Start and complete a book entirely.  This consistency will help you in doing a vast syllabus.\n\nLet me share what benefit I got from putting dedication in studies. I gave CUET and got into a college with a first preference course. There are a lot of facilities and events happen here frequently.  I am feeling secure about my career.\n\nI hope these insights will help you in your academic progress\n\nRegards, \nSaksham Singh \n\nFor any further query reach out at \nsakshamsingh5607@gmail.com",

      "text": "I’ve been building products online for years mostly SaaS web apps. I went through the usual indie hacker pipeline: find a niche, build a dashboard, charge $10–30/month, hope people find it useful.\n\nEvery time, it felt the same.  \nA few users trickled in.  \nSome loved it, most didn’t care.  \nChurn was brutal, acquisition was slow, and marketing felt like shouting into the void.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, SaaS isn’t dead. But for *solo developers* or small teams, it’s a tough game now. Everyone’s fighting for the same “B2B productivity” pie, and even when you build something great, growth is glacial without big marketing spend or a content engine.\n\nThen I tried something different.  \nI built a **mobile app**.\n\nAnd everything changed.\n\n# 🚀 The Shift\n\nI went from obsessing over feature roadmaps and pricing tiers to thinking about **dopamine loops**, **notifications**, and **user emotion**.  \nMobile is personal. It’s in people’s pockets. You can literally become part of their daily habits.\n\nAnd the distribution is *built-in*.  \nYou don’t need cold emails or endless SEO — you just need a solid hook, a good App Store listing, and a few viral users.\n\nThe first mobile app I made did more downloads in one week than all my SaaS apps combined did in their entire lifetimes.\n\nI found this boilerplate code online that made it much simpler to transition from web development to mobile app dev with react native which made collecting payment easy.\n\nWhy did i make the switch you may ask,  \nBecause consumers share *experiences*, not tools.  \nSaaS helps people work.  \nMobile apps help people *feel*.\n\n# 🧠 The Psychology Advantage\n\nWhen you build SaaS, you sell logic:\n\n>\n\nWhen you build mobile apps, you sell emotion:\n\n>\n\nPeople don’t rationalize $5/month for better spreadsheets.  \nBut they’ll happily pay $5/week to look hotter, be healthier, or feel more in control.\n\nIt’s the same psychology behind fitness subscriptions, habit trackers, and therapy apps — **emotion > utility**.\n\n# 💰 Monetization Feels… Easier?\n\nIn SaaS, a $29/month plan feels like a *commitment*.  \nOn mobile, $9.99/week feels like an *impulse*.  \nThe shorter billing cycle and instant gratification loop changes how people spend.\n\nAnd the App Store does the hard part for you — trust, payments, and recurring billing are baked in.  \nNo Stripe setup, no churn emails, no onboarding funnels.\n\n# 📈 Distribution > Features\n\nSaaS lives or dies by SEO, content, and cold outreach.  \nMobile lives or dies by virality, design, and psychology.\n\nIf you build something slightly novel, visual, or emotionally charged — it spreads.  \nEvery user becomes your marketing channel.  \nApp Store rankings and TikTok are your SEO.\n\n# 💡 What I Learned\n\n* **B2C isn’t easier — it’s faster.** You see if something works in days, not months.\n* **Emotions scale faster than utility.** Build for desire, not discipline.\n* **Push notifications are the best retention mechanic ever invented.**\n* **Mobile users forgive design flaws if the app feels alive. SaaS users don’t.**",

      "text": "I’m talking about the genius coder who aced your technical interview but is a black hole for team morale and velocity. Hiring for pure coding skill is the most common, and most expensive, mistake I see founders make.\n\nYour MVP’s success depends less on individual brilliance and more on a team that can actually build together. Stop looking for a rockstar. Start looking for the right fit.\n\nI learned this the hard way after seeing dozens of projects succeed or fail. It all comes down to three conversations you must have before you ever send an offer letter.\n\n**1. The Workflow Conversation: How do they *actually* work?**\n\nI once saw a founder hire a backend wizard who refused to write tests or participate in standups. The team’s velocity cratered, morale died, and the wizard was gone in three months. The damage was already done.\n\nYour interview process is broken if it only tests solo coding.\n\nInstead, do this:\n*   **Simulate Pair Programming.** Have them work with one of your current devs for an hour. Don't just watch the code. Watch the interaction. Do they get defensive when questioned? Can they explain their thought process clearly?\n*   **Run a Real Code Review.** Give them a pull request with some intentional (but subtle) flaws. Is their feedback constructive or just arrogant? Do they suggest solutions or just point out problems?\n\nYou're not testing if they can code. You’re testing if they can collaborate. A great solo coder is not always a great teammate.\n\n**2. The Communication Conversation: Can they explain anything?**\n\nWe inherited a project from a dev who wrote brilliant, complex code. The problem? He left zero documentation and his commit messages were useless. It took two new developers a month just to figure out how anything worked.\n\nTechnical skill means nothing if it’s locked in someone’s head.\n\nTest this directly:\n*   **The \"Explain It to a 5 Year Old\" Drill.** Ask them to explain a complex concept from their past work (like an API or a database schema) to you, pretending you have zero technical knowledge. If they can’t do it without jargon, they can’t talk to stakeholders.\n*   **The Crisis Simulation.** Give them a scenario: \"The main database just went down. The CEO is asking for an update. What do you write in the company wide Slack channel?\" Look for clarity and ownership, not technical rambling.\n\nGreat engineers make the complex simple. Bad ones make it sound complicated to appear smart.\n\n**3. The Values Conversation: What do they *really* care about?**\n\nThis is the one everyone gets wrong with soft, useless questions. A founder I know hired a dev who valued \"perfect code\" above all else. He spent six weeks endlessly polishing a single feature while the rest of the MVP stalled. The startup ran out of money before it ever launched.\n\nStop asking \"What are your greatest strengths?\". It's garbage.\n\nAsk questions that reveal their real priorities:\n*   **Pragmatism vs. Purity.** Ask, \"Tell me about a time a business deadline forced you to ship code you weren’t 100% proud of. What did you do and how did you feel about it?\" Their answer tells you if they understand that for a startup, shipping is a feature.\n*   **Be Brutally Honest.** Tell them your real culture, warts and all. \"We have crunch times before a big launch where people work late. How do you handle that?\" It’s better to scare off the wrong person now than have them quit in three months because of a values mismatch.\n\nHiring a developer is not about adding a pair of hands. It's about adding a node to a network. The wrong node doesn't just fail to contribute, it actively drains energy from everyone else. A brilliant jerk creates more work than they produce.\n\nSo, what's the most expensive hiring mistake you've ever made or seen?",

They already live inside WhatsApp — so why not make WhatsApp itself smarter?\n\nWith TodoBuddy, users can say things like:  \n🗓️ “Gym at 7 AM every day”  \n🎂 “Remind me of Raju’s birthday every year”  \n🛒 “Buy milk from D-Mart”  \n✈️ “Show my travel plans next week”  \n🎙️ “(voice note) Remind me about the Big Billion Sale next Monday”  \n📸 “(image of bill) — TodoBuddy creates a reminder to pay it on time”\n\nNo app installs. No new UI. Just WhatsApp chat → structured tasks → reminders.\n\nI soft-launched a few weeks ago and now see users from **6 continents**, managing everything from grocery lists to doctor appointments through WhatsApp.\n\nWould love feedback from the r/SaaS community on:\n\n1.

We've had freelancers and agencies tell us this is their #1 pain point.  \n  \nReal example: \"Every morning, check my invoices spreadsheet. If invoice is due in 3 days, send reminder. If overdue, send follow-up. Track all payments automatically.\"  \n  \nQuestion: If we went ALL IN on invoice recovery, what would be the must-have features beyond reminders? Thinking: payment link generation, escalation sequences, reporting?  \n  \nAlso checking out [Comet.ai](http://Comet.ai) now to see what they're doing differently.  \n  \nThanks for the brutal honesty.

You start with the market. You dig into what’s already out there, who the key players are, what the dynamics look like, where the gaps are, and what kind of products actually sell. It’s about spotting opportunities based on data, behavior, or market inefficiencies.\n\n**2. Top down:**  \nThis one starts from you. You identify what frustrates you, what you wish existed in the world, and what you genuinely care about building. Then you figure out if others feel the same way and whether you can rally a community around that shared need or belief.\n\nBoth paths can work. It just depends on how you think and what motivates you.\n\nAs for your question about pricing on Amazon, where people undercut each other, think of it this way: in every category, there’s always someone selling at a premium. Shoes, luggage, water bottles, doesn’t matter. The difference isn’t just in the product; it’s in the dream they’re selling.\n\nIf you’re entering a commodity market, your brand becomes the moat. You have to build it deliberately so that people remember you across every touchpoint: Amazon, social media, packaging, everything.\n\nHope that gives some clarity.",

It's not only monetary but also emotionally that takes a toll as you have a brilliant story but it seems that on social media it's hard to break through the noise of it all. And the sad thing is that even if you get the message across, does it actually convert?\n\n  \nAll I can say (and this is not from success) is whether you truly believe. What I mean by that is that core beliefs is what drives us to pursue, learn and improve. \n\nAt the same time being a realist, I would say paying more for a smaller MOQ to test the market is probably the best approach for you. What I've found in my business is that ensuring I keep the costs low whilst building the product market fit has allowed much more flexibility even though it's pre-revenue as I know this investment will compound once I've found the right stories. \n\nTo give an example - I spent $200 on doing my own content and markting on Tiktok and Instagram to obtain 200 downloads of my app - so my cost of aquisition is pretty much $1. With that I've then decided to invest in influencers and expect the cost of acquisition to be in the range of $1-$5.\n\n  \nHope this experience can help you navigate your way. Just remember - if you truly believe in your strategy then just go for it. I've never heard of anyone on their death bed regretting trying something, but I know that there are many who regret not giving something they believe in all that they had to offer.",

It's hitting the \"wall of reality\" - showing someone your thing and getting a lukewarm response, or seeing someone else already doing it, or realizing it's harder than you thought.\n\nThat fear convinces you the idea is bad, when really you just hit the first moment of resistance.\n\n2) Validation kills bad ideas early (which is good)\n\nSeveral people mentioned: talk to 10+ people before building anything. Most ideas die during validation, which saves you from the week 3 motivation crash.\n\n3) Tiny public deadlines force shipping\n\nWeekly updates, building in public, accountability partners - these create external pressure that internal motivation can't sustain.\n\n4) Finishing becomes addicting after the first win\n\nThe dopamine from shipping something (even if ugly) beats the dopamine from starting something new. But you have to get that first ship to experience it.\n\nI'm testing this myself right now - posting offers and seeing who responds before building anything elaborate.\n\nFor anyone stuck in the start-but-never-finish loop: what's the smallest thing you could ship this week?\n\nNot perfect.

Customers are happy, I'm happy, it \"just works\".\n\nNothing else is out there that does what my tool does, but there's a tonne of questions out there on how to achieve what my tool does, so I decided to brand it & slap a price-tag on it.\n\nSo, I've got it ready to go. Company registered, platform frontend and backend built. Tested & hardened over the last few weeks... but I haven't a clue where to go from here.\n\nI am not a marketing or sales guy. I also have little cash.\n\nPaid ads are a waste of time without cash behind them.\n\nIt's a product that will solely be sold to IT techs/MSPs so I guess cold outreach is an option to IT staff at literally any company, but as an IT guy myself I know how much spam they're already getting.\n\nOtherwise it's definitely a service I could have tech sites write about, so that would increase visibility.\n\nInterested in hearing ideas.",

      "text": "Hello,\n\nI am starting the development a MCP for loading internal « knowledge » into our GitHub Copilot context (should work with any MCP compatible editor), but I am wondering if any free open source solution already exist.\n\nNo commercial solution is possible. We have a bunch of internal tools, process, libraries, mainly in Python, and CLI tools with some complex configuration. Once a « mega prompt » is loaded into vs code copilot, it becomes quite an expert on our tool or library, so I am looking at a way to centralize these \"knowledges\" somewhere and have an MCP server let copilot discover the knowledge available to any tool (or lib), and load it on purpose, with advanced configuration example that can easily eat up the context.\n\nI recently discovered Skills from Claude, and it seems pretty close, I wonder if this won't become a standard for the future, with these partial loading of prompts per expertise level, and tessl.io for huge collection of up-to-date \"spec\" for opensource libraries. I think i want the mix of both, but for my internal company data (lib, tool, even processes, coding rules, ...)\n\nSo I am developing a MCP server project, made to run locally and perform some simple embeddings locally, on the CPU, but in this world when something already exist, I wonder if I am not doing it for nothing.\n\nAnd no, I do not have the option to have another subscription. This is the plague of this AI revolution, everything is ultra-expansive, based on another-subscription for this MCP, another for that...\n\nMy main problem is that these knowledges are not public and need to be access controlled (i use a git clone on our internal Gitlab instance to retrieve these mega prompt as one or several git project). So sending them to a third party is extremely complex (in term of buying process in my company). So no, we have a Github Copilot subscription (was hard enough to get it), it works marveillously, I want, for the first use case, to use it and only that.\n\n**Some use cases:**\n\nGeneration use case #1:\n\n* wonderful\\_lib has many amazing functions, documented, but badly known outside of our developers\n* using our new magic MCP server, it can be parsed, and then Skill-like files (Markdown) are generated, on three different detail levels, and stored in a \"knowledge\" repository. \n   * L1=general (\"what this lib is about, list of main API\"), \n   * L2=details (full docstring + small examples), \n   * L3=collection of samples.\n* typically L3 is not needed for simple functions. For advanced tools it may be useful.\n* this is then commited into a Git repository (private)\n* then, when this magic MCP server, user register several of these repositories (or registries of repositories, for instance at teams level), and the \"knowledge\" are discovered\n* when a developer wants to know how to do thing XX, the magic mcp can anwser it knows that there is a lib in its language in the company called XXX.\n* then load L1 to give more accurate anwser (capability of the functions,...), and when user start work on the code, loads L3 if the code is really complex.\n\nGeneration use case #2:\n\n* basically, regenerate tessl.io spec but without subscription\n* we setup a \"interesting opensource lib\" knowledge-repository, and user can commit L1/L2/L3 generated by magic-mcp-server. can be useful for very nice libraries.\n* can also be useful to build a skill repository on a particular way to use some tools (ex: our company way of using Nix, or how to work with this firewall everybody loves) \n\nOf course, it is also possible to have a cli tool with external LLM API access for mass-production of such skills.\n\nSo, several questions:\n\n* do you think the \"Skill\" format set by Anthropic will become a standard (in this case i will align to this format, it is just adding frontmatter what i see)\n* do you know any opensource, installable mcp server that does what I want to do ?\n* Do you think it is a good idea? Would you use it?",

      "text": "TLDR: This is a follow up to these posts and recent posts about trying to preserve artist styles from older models like SDXL. I've created a workflow to try to solve for this.\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1o9gvgg/controlnets\\_in\\_flux\\_to\\_pass\\_rendering\\_to\\_sdxl/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1o9gvgg/controlnets_in_flux_to_pass_rendering_to_sdxl/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mjhd8z/flux\\_krea\\_qwen\\_wan\\_chromawhich\\_one\\_approximated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mjhd8z/flux_krea_qwen_wan_chromawhich_one_approximated/)\n* [https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mlw46b/style\\_of\\_namedropping\\_via\\_embedded\\_sd15\\_workflow/n7ta7s8/](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1mlw46b/style_of_namedropping_via_embedded_sd15_workflow/n7ta7s8/)\n\n**The problem:**\n\nAll the models post-SDXL seem to be subpar at respecting artist styles.\\* The new models are just lackluster when it comes to reproducing artist styles accurately. So I thought: why not enhance SDXL output with controlnets from a modern model like Flux, which has better prompt comprehension?\n\n*\\*If I'm wrong on this, please I would happily like to be wrong, but in the many threads on here I've encountered, and in my testing as well (even fiddling with Flux guidance), styles do not come thru accurately.*\n\n**My workflow here**: [https://pastebin.com/YvFUgacE](https://pastebin.com/YvFUgacE)\n\n**Screenshot**: [https://imgur.com/a/Ihsb5SJ](https://imgur.com/a/Ihsb5SJ)\n\nWhat this workflow does is use Flux loaded via Nunchaku for speed, to generate these controlnets: DWPose Estimator, Softedge, Depth Anything V2, and OpenPose. The initial prompt is purely composition--no mention of styles other than the medium (illustration vs. painting, etc). It then passes the controlnet data along to SDXL, which continues the render, applying an SDXL version of the prompt with artist styles applied.\n\n**But shouldn't you go from SDXL and enhance with Flux?**\n\nUser u/DelinquentTuna kindly pointed me to this \"Frankenflux\" workflow: [https://pastebin.com/Ckf64x7g](https://pastebin.com/Ckf64x7g) which does the reverse: render in SDXL, then try to spruce things up with Flux. I tested out this workflow, but in my tests it really doesn't preserve artist styles to the extent my approach does (see below).\\*\n\n*(\\*Maybe I'm doing it wrong and need to tweak this workflow's settings, but I don't know what to tweak, so do educate me if so.)*\n\nI've attached tests here: [https://imgur.com/a/3jBKFFg](https://imgur.com/a/3jBKFFg) which includes examples of my output vs. their approach. Notice how Frazetta in theirs is glossy and modern (barely Frazetta's actual style), vs. Frazetta in mine, which is way closer to his actual art.\n\n**RE: Performance:**\n\nI get about \\~30ish seconds per image with my workflow on a 3090 with an older CPU from 2016. But that's *AFTER* the first time I run an image. The models take for F\\*CKING EVER to load on first run. Like 8+ minutes! But once you finish 1 image run, then it loads Flux+SDXL in about 30s per image. I don't know how to speed up the first run. I've tried many things and nothing speeds it up. It seems loading Flux and the controlnets the first time is what's taking so long. Plz help. I am a comfy noob.\n\n**Compatibility and features:**\n\nI could only get Nunchaku to run without errors if I am on Python 3.1.1 and using Nunchaku 1.0.0. So my environment has a 311 version that I run under. The workflow supports SDXL loras and lets you split your prompt (which is parsed for wildcards like \\_\\_haircolor\\_\\_; if present, it will look for a file named \"haircolor.txt\" in \\\\comfyui\\\\wildcards\\\\) into 1) pure composition (fed to Flux) and 2) pure composition + style (fed to SDXL). I write the prompt as SDXL comma-separated tokens for convenience, but in an ideal world, you'd write a normal language prompt for Flux. But I think Flux is smart enough to interpret an SDXL prompt, based on my minimal tests. The custom nodes in the workflow you'd need:\n\n* Nunchaku Flux DiT Loader\n* DW Pose Estimator\n* Depth Anything V2 - Relative\n* [**comfyui\\_controlnet\\_aux**](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux)\n* [**ComfyUI\\_essentials**](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_essentials)\n* QuenWildcards (below)\n\nI also created a custom node for my wildcards. You can download it here: [https://pastebin.com/t5LYyyPC](https://pastebin.com/t5LYyyPC)\n\n(You can adjust where it looks for the wildcard folder in the script or in the node. Put the node your \\\\custom\\_nodes\\\\ folder as \"QuenWildcards\".)\n\n**Current issues:**\n\n* Initial render takes 8 minutes! Insane. I don't know if it's just my PC being shit. After that, images render in about 30s on a 3090. It's because of all the models loading on first run as far as I can tell, and I can't figure out how to speed that up. It may be because my models don't reside on my fastest drive.\n* You can attach SDXL loras, but you need to fiddle with the controlnet strengths, KSampler in SDXL, and/or the Load Lora strength/clip to let them influence the end result. (They are set to bypass right now; I have support for 2 loras in the workflow.) It's tough and I don't know the surefire trick to getting then to apply reliably besides tweaking parameters.\n* I haven't figured out the best approach to deal with Loras that change the composition of images. For example, I created Loras of fantasy races that I apply in SDXL (like Tieflings or Minotaurs), however the problem here is that the controlnets influence the composition that SDXL ends up working with, so these Loras struggle to take effect. I think I need to retrain them for Flux and apply them as part of the controlnet \"pass\", so the silhouettes carry their shapes, and then also use them on the SDXL end of the pipeline. A lot of work for my poor 3090.\n\nAll advice welcome... I just started using ComfyUI so forgive me for any stupid decisions here.",

So you're evidently comparing SD 1.5 vs SDXL and complaining that one provides better detail than the other. Doh? It is strange, too, that you are claiming to have tested my prototype when you clearly diverge from the prompting and weighting style of the reference I provided. It isn't even clear that you used Krea where I did. Given the way you tagged me and seem to be posturing to one-up me, it's weird that you are here critiquing my work based on what you've done with it instead of what I would've done had I been involved.\n\nYour precept was that you couldn't use modern models because they didn't recognize styles. And **your proposed solution is to fix a rigid series of controlnets for SD to use like a coloring book**?  Weak.  From a logical standpoint, it makes much more sense to use the model that understands the style as the reference source upon which the modern model can adapt (at higher resolution and in higher detail). How are you going to do crazy styles that have unusual geometrical or perspective features like you might find in Dali, Bosch, Picasso, etc with your setup if Flux is willfully blind to them preventing you from generating your host of precise controlnets? It's a chicken and egg problem.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm pretty sure SDXL can already do a shirtless barbarian or a winged elf. I'm not sure you've added any value from at all... if all you're getting from the SDXL refine is low-detail color and brush strokes/pen lines then you might as well instead use it as a reference image... and then you're all of a sudden doing what I suggested all along.",

      "text": "After 9 months fighting architectural violations in AI-generated code, I stopped treating AI coding assistants like junior devs who read docs. Custom instructions and documentation get buried after 15-20 conversation turns. Path-based pattern injection with runtime feedback loops fixed it. If you are working on a large mono-repo, this fits well as we already used it for our 50+ packages repo.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n82aleea1wf1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83fee2fb8a6a9f5265bad185ed109e32cb3bad7\n\nTHE CORE PROBLEM: AI Forgets Your Rules After Long Conversations \n\nYou write architectural rules in custom instructions. AI reads them at the start. But after 20 minutes of back-and-forth, it forgets them. The rules are still in the conversation history, but AI stops paying attention to them. \n\nWorse: when you write \"follow clean architecture\" for your entire codebase, AI doesn't know which specific rules matter for which files. A database repository file needs different patterns than a React component. Giving the same generic advice to both doesn't help.\n\n\n\nTHE SOLUTION: Give AI Rules Right Before It Writes Code \n\nDifferent file types get different rules. Instead of giving AI all the rules upfront, we give it the specific rules it needs right before it generates each file. Pattern Definition (architect.yaml):\n\n    patterns:\n      - path: \"src/routes/**/handlers.ts\"\n        must_do:\n          - Use IoC container for dependency resolution\n          - Implement OpenAPI route definitions\n          - Use Zod for request validation\n          - Return structured error responses\n    \n      - path: \"src/repositories/**/*.ts\"\n        must_do:\n          - Implement IRepository<T> interface\n          - Use injected database connection\n          - No direct database imports\n          - Include comprehensive error handling\n    \n      - path: \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"\n        must_do:\n          - Use design system components from @agimonai/web-ui\n          - Ensure dark mode compatibility\n          - Use Tailwind CSS classes only\n          - No inline styles or CSS-in-JS\n\n\n\nWHY THIS WORKS: Fresh Rules = AI Remembers\n\nWhen you give AI the rules 1-2 messages before it writes code, those rules are fresh in its \"memory.\" Then we immediately check if it followed them. This creates a quick feedback loop. Think of it like human learning: you don't memorize the entire style guide. You look up specific rules when you need them, get feedback, and learn.\n\nTradeoff: Takes 1-2 extra seconds per file. For a 50-file feature, that's 50-100 seconds total. But we're trading seconds for quality that would take hours of manual code review.\n\n\n\nTHE 2 MCP TOOLS\n\nTool 1: get-file-design-pattern (called BEFORE code generation)\n\n    Input:\n    get-file-design-pattern(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\")\n    \n    Output:\n    {\n      \"template\": \"backend/hono-api\",\n      \"patterns\": [\n        \"Implement IRepository<User> interface\",\n        \"Use injected database connection\",\n        \"Named exports only\",\n        \"Include comprehensive TypeScript types\"\n      ],\n      \"reference\": \"src/repositories/baseRepository.ts\"\n    }\n\nGives AI the rules right before it writes code. Rules are fresh, specific, and actionable.\n\nTool 2: review-code-change (called AFTER code generation)\n\n    Input:\n    review-code-change(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\", generatedCode)\n    \n    Output:\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"LOW\",\n      \"violations\": [],\n      \"compliance\": \"100%\",\n      \"patterns_followed\": [\n        \"✅ Implements IRepository<User>\",\n        \"✅ Uses dependency injection\",\n        \"✅ Named export used\",\n        \"✅ TypeScript types present\"\n      ]\n    }\n\nSeverity levels drive automation:\n\n* LOW → Auto-submit for human review (95% of cases)\n* MEDIUM → Flag for developer attention, proceed with warning (4%)\n* HIGH → Block submission, auto-fix and re-validate (1%)\n\nTook us 2 weeks to figure out severity levels. We analyzed 500+ violations and categorized by impact: breaks the code (HIGH), violates architecture (MEDIUM), style preferences (LOW). This reduced AI blocking good code by 73%.\n\n\n\nWORKFLOW EXAMPLE\n\nDeveloper: \"Add a user repository with CRUD methods\"\n\nStep 1: Pattern Discovery\n\n    // AI assistant calls MCP tool\n    get-file-design-pattern(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\")\n    \n    // Receives guidance immediately before generating code\n    {\n      \"patterns\": [\n        \"Implement IRepository<User> interface\",\n        \"Use dependency injection\",\n        \"No direct database imports\"\n      ]\n    }\n\nStep 2: Code Generation AI writes code following the rules it just received (still fresh in its \"memory\").\n\nStep 3: Validation\n\n    review-code-change(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\", generatedCode)\n    \n    // Receives validation\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"LOW\",\n      \"violations\": [],\n      \"compliance\": \"100%\"\n    }\n\nStep 4: Submission Low severity → AI submits code for human review. High severity → AI tries to fix the problems and checks again (up to 3 attempts).\n\n\n\nLAYERED VALIDATION STRATEGY\n\nWe use 4 layers of checking. Each catches different problems:\n\n1. TypeScript → Type errors, syntax mistakes\n2. ESLint → Code style, unused variables\n3. CodeRabbit → General code quality, bugs\n4. Architect MCP → Architecture rules (our tool)\n\nTypeScript won't catch \"you used the wrong export style.\" ESLint won't catch \"you broke our architecture by importing database directly.\" CodeRabbit might notice but won't stop it. Our tool enforces architecture rules the other tools can't check.\n\n\n\nWHAT WE LEARNED THE HARD WAY\n\n1. Start with real problems, not theoretical rules\n\nDon't write perfect rules from scratch. We spent 3 months looking at our actual code to find what went wrong (messy dependencies, inconsistent patterns, error handling). Then we made rules to prevent those specific problems.\n\nWriting rules: 2 days. Finding real problems: 1 week. But the real problems showed us which rules actually mattered.\n\n2. Severity levels are critical for adoption\n\nInitially everything was HIGH. AI refused to submit constantly. Developers bypassed the system by disabling MCP validation.\n\nWe categorized rules by impact:\n\n* HIGH: Breaks compilation, violates security, breaks API contracts (1% of rules)\n* MEDIUM: Violates architecture, creates technical debt (15% of rules)\n* LOW: Style preferences, micro-optimizations, documentation (84% of rules)\n\nReduced false positives by 70%. Adoption went from 40% to 92%.\n\n3. Rule priority matters\n\nWe have 3 levels of rules:\n\n* Global rules (apply to 95% of files): Export style, TypeScript settings, error handling\n* Template rules (framework-specific): React rules, API rules\n* File-specific rules: Database file rules, component rules, route rules\n\nWhen rules conflict, most specific wins: File-specific beats template beats global.\n\n4. Using AI to check AI code actually works\n\nSounds weird to have AI check its own code, but it works. The checking AI only sees the code and rules—it doesn't know about your conversation. It's like a fresh second opinion.\n\nIt catches 73% of violations before human review. The other 27% get caught by humans or automated tests. Catching 73% automatically saves massive time.\n\n\n\nTECH STACK DECISIONS\n\nWhy MCP (Model Context Protocol):\n\nWe needed a way to give AI information right when it's writing code, not just at the start. MCP lets us do this: give rules before code generation, check code after generation.\n\nWhat we tried:\n\n* Custom wrapper around AI → Breaks when AI updates\n* Only static code analysis → Can't catch architecture violations\n* Git hooks → Too late, code already written\n* IDE plugins → Only works in one IDE\n\nMCP won because it works with any tool that supports it (Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.).\n\nWhy YAML for rules:\n\nWe tried TypeScript, JSON, and YAML. YAML won because it's easy to read and edit. Non-technical people (product managers, architects) can write rules without learning code.\n\nYAML is easy to review in pull requests and supports comments. Downside: no automatic validation. So we built a validator.\n\nWhy use AI instead of traditional code analysis:\n\nWe tried using traditional code analysis tools first. Hit problems:\n\n* Can't detect architecture violations like \"you broke the dependency injection pattern\"\n* Analyzing type relationships across files is super complex\n* Need framework-specific knowledge for each framework\n* Breaks every time TypeScript updates\n\nAI can understand \"intent\" not just syntax. Example: AI can detect \"this component mixes business logic with UI presentation\" which traditional tools can't catch.\n\nTradeoff: Takes 1-2 extra seconds vs catching 100% of architecture issues. We chose catching everything.\n\n\n\nLIMITATIONS & EDGE CASES\n\n1. Takes time for large changes Checking 50-100 files adds 2-3 minutes. Noticeable on big refactors. Working on caching and batch checking (check 10 files at once).\n2. Rules can conflict Sometimes global rules conflict with framework rules. Example: \"always use named exports\" vs Next.js \"pages need default export.\" Need better tools to show conflicts.\n3. Sometimes flags good code (3-5%) AI occasionally marks valid code as wrong. Happens when code uses advanced patterns AI doesn't recognize. Building a way for developers to mark these false alarms.\n4. New rules need testing Adding a rule requires testing on existing projects to avoid breaking things. We version our rules (v1, v2) but haven't automated migration yet.\n5. Doesn't replace humans Catches architecture violations. Won't catch:\n\n* Business logic bugs\n* Performance issues\n* Security vulnerabilities\n* User experience problems\n* API design issues\n\nThis is layer 4 of 7 in our quality process. We still do human code review, testing, security scanning, and performance checks.\n\n6. Takes time to set up First set of rules takes 2-3 days. You need to know what architecture matters to your team. If your architecture is still changing, wait to set this up.\n\nWe shared some of the tools we used internally to help our team here [https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit](https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit) . Check tools/architect-mcp/ for MCP server implementation and templates/ for pattern examples.\n\nBottom line: putting rules in documentation doesn't scale well. AI forgets them after a long conversation. Giving AI specific rules right before it writes each file works.",

I immediately got slammed with upload limit size restrictions. I couldn’t paste the code anymore. I tried to drag the txt file into the chat box. It uploaded, but Claude insisted it wasn’t there. I had to upload to the project folder. That seemed to work. \n\nHowever, when asking for the change to be made and the code to be sent back to me, it would constantly stop half way and make me press continue.

      "text": "**Data Used**: All comments from both the Performance Megathread and the Usage Limits Megathread from October 8 to October 19\n\nFull list of Past Megathreads and Reports: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/megathreads/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/megathreads/)\n\nDisclaimer: This was entirely built by AI. Please report any hallucinations or errors.\n\n---\n\n# 🚨 Weekly Claude Performance and Usage Reports Megathreads Deep-Dive (Oct 8–19) — **Unified Topics + Workarounds **\n\n## TL;DR (top-priority takeaways)\n\n* **Sentiment:** Mostly **negative**. People hit **weekly caps** way faster than expected; **timeouts/retries**, **early context compaction**, and **artifacts/export** flakiness made it worse.\n* **Incidents matched the pain:** Outages/“elevated errors” on Oct 8/10/17 line up with the rough days.\n* **Model feel:** Perceived **Sonnet 4.5 regression** (instruction-following/verbosity/vision). No public confirmation of a “nerf.”\n* **Workarounds:** Default **Sonnet 4.5** for long coding/agents; **reserve Opus**; **turn off Web/Search** unless necessary; **hard cap verbosity**; **trim projects/servers**; **check Statuspage** before big runs; **manual/Markdown exports** and **use web client** if Desktop/export is glitchy.\n\n---\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nAcross both Megathreads (Oct 8–19), users report three big issues: (1) **weekly usage limits** depleting much faster than expected with **accounting oddities** (e.g., Opus debits while Sonnet is selected; odd “session reset” windows); (2) **performance instability** (timeouts, “taking longer than usual,” early compaction/Retrieval Mode, intermittent artifacts/export); and (3) **perceived Sonnet 4.5 quality drop** (instruction-following, verbosity even on “Concise,” brittle long runs, underwhelming vision). These map closely to **status incidents** around Oct 8/10/17. Anthropic is steering towards **Sonnet 4.5** for coding/agents and recently launched **Haiku 4.5**, which likely shifted traffic/capacity. There’s **no public confirmation** of a deliberate Sonnet 4.5 downgrade or an official **Projects→Retrieval threshold change** this week; infra/UI/plugin instability plausibly drove the perceived regressions.\n\n---\n\n## **Unified Topics: Key Observations + Recurring Themes (from both Megathreads, impact-ranked)**\n\n### 1) **Usage limits feel broken/opaque & burn far too fast**  *(highest impact)*\n\n* **Fast depletion examples:** 79% in ~2 days on Sonnet-only; 55–60% in 2–3 hours; 26% in a few hours.\n* **Accounting anomalies:** Opus pool advancing even with Sonnet selected; session bar low while weekly bar jumps high; inconsistent “session resets” (reports of ~8 hours).\n* **Search/Web burn:** single runs can chew a large chunk of the session.\n* **Near-cap volatility:** “unknown error,” lockouts, failed sign-ins close to the limit.\n\n### 2) **Context compaction & Retrieval Mode kick in early**\n\n* Reports of **abrupt compaction** and **Projects flipping to Retrieval** sooner; user-claimed threshold shifts 6%→5%→4% (no official confirmation).\n* **Max chat length** *feels* shorter.\n* Trimming Projects/servers (MCP) and clearing caches only **partially** mitigates it.\n\n### 3) **Performance instability: timeouts, retries, overload**\n\n* “Taking longer than usual… Trying again (4/10→10/10),” timeouts/500s, server overload; some reports specific to **Opus 4.1**.\n* **Sign-in/chats inaccessible** reports, often around limits windows and incident days.\n* Status incidents on **Oct 8/10/17** align with the spike in pain.\n\n### 4) **Artifacts & export regressions (features flaking out)**\n\n* **Artifacts fail to render**; **Export to PDF/Save to Project** options vanish; some report **lost access to older artifacts**; support feels slow.\n* In rare cases, risk of **meaningful data loss** if you relied on Project artifacts only.\n\n### 5) **Perceived Sonnet 4.5 regression (instruction-following, verbosity, vision)**\n\n* **Ignores straightforward instructions**, feels “**lobotomized**” vs early-days; **verbosity spikes** even on “Concise”; **Stop** spinner continues while burning quota.\n* **Vision** results disappoint; for some niche image tasks, earlier models/competitors are preferred.\n\n### 6) **UI telemetry confusion & minor quality-of-life notes**\n\n* **Usage monitors/status line** appear misleading during compaction or heavy runs.\n* **Styles** help steer tone/format; **Markdown export** is a solid fallback when PDF/Save disappears.\n\n---\n\n## Overall User Sentiment (comments-only)\n\n* **Balance:** Mostly **negative**—frustration/anger, talk of cancelling; a few neutral tips sprinkled in.\n* **Nature:** “Used to be great; now slow/opaque.” Anxiety about burning caps; disappointment in **context collapse** and **artifacts/export**; credibility wobble.\n* **Week pattern:** Mid-week saw more **compaction/RAG threshold** complaints; Oct 14–17 clustered **timeouts/overload** and **feature loss**, matching incidents.\n\n---\n\n## Possible Workarounds (complete, impact-ranked; **all promising items included**)\n\n### 🔴 High-impact (do these first)\n\n1. **Pick the right model for the job (cut burn + retries).**\n\n   * Default to **Sonnet 4.5** for most coding/agentic work.\n   * **Reserve Opus** for genuinely hard prompts (Opus nukes caps fast).\n   * Use **Haiku 4.5** for simple/cheap steps to stretch weekly usage.\n\n2. **Turn off Web/Search unless it’s essential.**\n\n   * Several users saw a single Search/Web run consume a large chunk of the session.\n\n3. **Enforce strict brevity.**\n\n   * Use **Concise** *and* add a hard cap in your system/preamble (e.g., “≤5 bullets, ≤120 words”).\n   * This counters verbosity creep and reduces limit burn.\n\n4. **Check the Statuspage before expensive runs.**\n\n   * If there’s any ongoing incident (“elevated errors”), postpone heavy/long tasks so you don’t waste quota on retries.\n\n5. **Manage context to delay compaction/Retrieval Mode.**\n\n   * **Trim Projects** (remove bulky attachments), **disable extra MCP servers**, clear caches.\n   * **Split long tasks** into phases with short runs; avoid mega-threads that balloon.\n\n6. **Checkpoint and rotate threads.**\n\n   * Every few heavy exchanges, **summarize state**, then **start a fresh thread**.\n   * This reduces the chance of sudden compaction ruining continuity.\n\n---\n\n### 🟠 Medium-impact (stability + burn control)\n\n7. **Avoid peak hours & “quality-over-speed” if it increases burn.**\n\n   * Users observed faster depletion and more retries during peaks and with some toggles.\n\n8. **Keep sessions short; restart after long tool use.**\n\n   * Long-lived/idle agent runs correlate with timeouts and tool_result loops.\n   * Prefer **shorter runs** and **explicit restarts** after major steps.\n\n9. **If Desktop/VS Code is flaky, switch to the web app (claude.ai) and keep extensions updated.**\n\n   * Desktop had a documented outage; web/iOS/Android were unaffected.\n   * Some extension-level instability is version-specific.\n\n10. **Kill stray/background processes that burn tokens.**\n\n    * Watch for orphaned **Claude Code/shell** processes (they can silently consume large token counts).\n    * Restart the IDE/CLI after intensive sessions.\n\n---\n\n### 🟡 Situational (usage planning + data safety + task-specific)\n\n11. **Plan around limits.**\n\n    * Schedule heavy work **near weekly resets**.\n    * If eligible, consider **API overage on Max** during crunch weeks.\n    * Offload routine steps to **lower-cost models** (Haiku) to preserve Sonnet/Opus headroom.\n\n12. **Artifact/export survival kit.**\n\n    * If artifacts don’t render or **Export/Save to Project** vanishes:\n\n      * **Manual copy** outputs immediately;\n      * **Export to Markdown** as a fallback;\n      * Keep **local backups** (rare reports of losing access to older artifacts).\n    * If Desktop export is unreliable, **use the web client**.\n    * Where helpful, leverage community **artifact-downloader utilities** as a temporary bridge.\n\n13. **Vision prompts: tighten and sequence.**\n\n    * Ask **specific, region-anchored** questions; use **step-checks**.\n    * For critical image tasks, compare against **alternative models** if results lag expectations.\n\n---\n\n## Potential Emerging Issues (from comments)\n\n* **Telemetry weirdness** (session vs weekly bars; “resets in ~8 hours?”) and **weekly jumps** appear more common.\n* **Artifact access loss** + slow support—edge-case risk of genuine data loss if relying solely on Projects.\n* **Verbosity creep** that ignores “Concise,” inflating token burn.\n\n---\n\n## 🧵 Conclusion: State of Claude This Week\n\n**State of play (what it *feels* like):**\nThe community’s impression is that Claude had a **rocky, resource-hungry week**. People hit **weekly limits** far earlier than expected, saw **timeouts/retries** exactly when they needed reliability, and ran into **early context compaction** that broke momentum. The **feature layer** didn’t help—**artifacts/export** went missing or misbehaved for some, and **telemetry** (session vs weekly bars) felt misleading. Net result: a once-smooth workflow felt **fragile and costly**, and that *looks* like a quality regression to end users—even if much of it traces back to incidents and client/plugin fragility rather than a deliberate model change.\n\n**The good news:** when runs are clean, **Sonnet 4.5** still produces strong work—especially for coding/agentic tasks. Users who managed model mix, trimmed context, and avoided incident windows reported more predictable outcomes. The overall vibe isn’t “Claude is bad now,” it’s: **“Claude is inconsistent, and the meters make me anxious.”**\n\n---\n\n**Most significant sources used (priority order)**\n\n* Anthropic Statuspage incident logs (Oct 8: elevated Sonnet 4.5 errors; Oct 10: elevated claude.ai/Claude Code errors; Oct 17: Claude Desktop outage).\n* Anthropic’s “Introducing Claude Sonnet 4.5” announcement (positioned as best coding/computer-use model).\n* Credible press on Haiku 4.5 launch (Reuters, TechRepublic, Tom’s Guide, TheTechPortal) for context on model/capacity churn.\n\n---\n\n\n",

      "text": "Hey folks,\n\nSo, I'm in VS Code all day and have been trying to get these new LLM agent plugins (like Cline, Roo Code, etc.) to help me write my code. They're awesome for spitting out boilerplate or a quick function. But the moment I ask the agent to refactor something, it becomes a total nightmare.\n\nI'm honestly wondering if I'm doing something wrong, or if this is just how it is right now. Here's what's been driving me up the wall:\n\n1. **It just copy-pastes stuff.** I'll say \"move this function,\" and it just... doesn't. It copies the code to the new file but leaves the old one there. So my first step is always cleaning up its mess.\n2. **It breaks all the paths.** This is the worst part. The agent has no clue how to update imports or any other references. It just leaves a trail of broken code, and I have to go on a scavenger hunt to fix every little thing. It's a huge pain to even tell if the refactor worked.\n3. **My tests make it worse.** I always write a ton of tests before a refactor, thinking it would help the AI. Nope. It just gives the agent more stuff to break. It tries to update the tests, fails miserably at the paths, and doubles the number of errors I have to fix.\n\nThe whole thing is just a massive churn. What should be a simple task turns into this long, drawn-out process of telling the AI what to do, fixing its mistakes, and then cleaning up the duplicates.\n\nSo, what's the deal? Has anyone actually figured out a good workflow for this? Are there some magic prompts I'm missing? Or are these tools just not ready for real refactoring yet?\n\n**TL;DR:** Trying to use LLM agents in VS Code to refactor my code is a mess of copy-pasting, broken imports, and busted tests. If you've figured out how to make it not suck, please share your secrets.",

The gurus and fake success stories come later in this post, trust me... but back to it for now.\n\nI had SaaS founders, ecom guys, even agency owners showing up on my calendar. For the first time in months, it felt like I could actually breathe a little. Not a lot, but enough to think this was the turning point. I felt ready, nervous, excited all at once. Because hey, getting on calls felt like the big win.\n\nI had slides, Looms, workflows ready to show. I thought I was about to join that big online crowd of people flashing numbers like 50k, 100k, 300k per month from their AI agencies. They made it look like all you had to do was build something, pitch it, close the deal. I believed it too. Which now feels kinda dumb, but back then I bought into it.\n\nThen I actually got on those first calls. And I completely destroyed every single one.\n\nNot because my offer sucked. Not because of price. But because I just could not shut up. I went into full tech nerd mode. Explaining every detail, from GPT prompts to n8n flows to data cleanup before sending to the CRM. I thought they’d be impressed. Instead, I literally watched their energy drop. Nods, polite smiles, the classic “interesting” and then… nothing.\n\nAt first I blamed them. Said to myself, they just don’t get it. But deep down I knew it was me. I was teaching instead of selling. Trying to prove I was smart instead of proving I understood their pain.\n\nThen came one call I’ll never forget. A SaaS founder from Berlin cut me off mid-ramble and asked, So what does this actually make us in money? I froze. I had no answer. I knew the tools but not the business value. That question haunted me that night and it made me realize I was still hiding behind the tech, same as when I used to waste time making fake portfolios. It felt safe, but it didn’t bring cash.\n\nNext call, I changed everything. No screen share, no tech talk. I just asked questions. What slows you down right now? What feels messy in your process? What are you paying staff to do that eats time? They answered, I took notes, then I asked what it costs them in hours or lost revenue. Once they said the number out loud, half the job was done.\n\nAnd when I finally pitched, I kept it simple. One clear outcome. Not a deck with ten points. Just one. Example: every new lead gets a reply in under a minute. Or your sales team only talks to qualified leads. When they asked how, I just said we use a tested GPT setup running in the background. You’ll see the results. Then I went right back to ROI. That changed everything.\n\nCalls felt calm. Prospects leaned in. They started buying. Because I wasn’t performing anymore, I was diagnosing. And that’s when I finally started closing.\n\nFast forward, I’m writing this tired as hell after a long trip through Romania, now in Budapest instead of out clubbing tonight. So this is more of a brain dump.\n\nHere’s the real part nobody tells you. The internet is flooded with fake gurus. Scroll YouTube or TikTok and you’ll see 18 year olds claiming 300k a month from their AI agency, showing cut-off Stripe screenshots. It’s garbage. I’ve been doing this long enough to know what real work looks like. I’ve delivered systems, consulted, built stuff that runs daily, and the best month I’ve had was around 30k. Most months are 10–15k. That’s real. Not viral flex money, but real.\n\nThose guru kids sell a dream, not a business. They make beginners feel like failures if they’re not millionaires by month two. They make clients skeptical because they’ve been burned by promises. I’ve literally had clients tell me straight up, You guys all promise the world. That’s the damage.\n\nIf someone really makes 300k per month, they’re not wasting time filming YouTube vids asking you to join their Skool group. Come on.\n\nSo if you’re new and feel stuck because your first sale is taking forever, ignore the noise. Forget the fake 300k promises. What you don’t see are the real nights fixing broken workflows at 2am while a client is pinging your phone. That’s the actual journey. That’s where you grow.\n\nIf there’s one takeaway: stop trying to sound like a genius. Be clear, calm, ask the right questions, do the math, and show one result. That’s sales. And ignore the kids pushing “make 100k a month with AI automation” because no, they’re just monetizing you. You are the product.\n\nAnd when you finally close some deals, that’s when the next battle starts, delivery. Making sure what you promised actually works, scales, and keeps clients happy. That’s the real game. But for now, I need some sleep.\n\nP.S. Always ask yourself, how is this internet guru really making money? If the numbers get too wild, you already know the answer. Nobody doing 100k plus months is on TikTok chasing views.\n\nThanks for reading this long rant. I know it’s not a TikTok clip or YouTube monologue with perfect lighting. Just raw thoughts. \n\nSee you on the next one.\n\nGG",

Everyone outside our studio tried to sell tech or ideas. We did things differently and had way better customer deal closing rates, satisfaction, adoption, and repeats than anyone else in our division. We were a mystery to our peers because we didn’t show up polished and glitzy. \n\nWe talked with customers, got to know them, their goals, process, needs, wants, pain, priorities, requirements, budgets, and readiness. ONLY once we had that conversation, could we actually begin to help. \n\nOur team was awesome so we could practically solve anything, but you have to solve the right thing at the right time.

But if you just need a local pair programmer, there are a few good open source code models you can run locally (another example is the ibm granite 8b code instruct).",

Then you need to pay for electricity, cooling, racks, etc. You can also use quantized versions which may work on smaller GPUs but you still need massive amounts of RAM for offloading and quality and speed will degrade.

Will this ‘core infra’ support that, or at least plan so transitioning years later isn’t a scrap and rebuilt scenario.\n\nI think we’re inside of a 24 month stretch where vibe coding/pair coding becomes an actual discipline. I don’t think the LLMs are the problem, we’re still building the tooling around them and still making huge improvements on how they manage context.\n\nSo yea, inside 24 months and $10,000, you’ll be vibe coding in Mama’s basement like it’s 1986. I’d also argue the tools aren’t the issue, it’s the users. People who put time, energy, and thought into their work, even with lesser models, generally see better results.

It starts reading files or doing index searches and then it seems to rabit trail when researching for a topic: it will read a file, then find some tidbit it needed to research from that file, read that new file and so on and so on. Then after researching way too many files (and bloating the context) it would find it's way back to one of the initial files and the loop would start over. Sometimes I could stop it by adding something like \"You have researched enough, now use the analysis to complete the task\", but other times it would continue for a bit and then fall into the same pattern.  \n\nHas anyone else noticed this behavior or is this just an issue with local models not being smart enough to use the tricks Kilocode now leverages in its context gathering?\n\nIs there a new setting I am not seeing that might be contributing to this behavior?\n\nI switched to RooCode to see if I experienced the same thing and it works fine.

Right now, I have to manually navigate through multiple folders to find it, which becomes quite tedious.\n\nAlso, I don’t need an AI that does everything for me with simple instructions. If I aimed for perfection that way, I’d end up fighting with the AI 24/7.

Renting a GPU for video generation is quite common until you build your own PC.\n​Runpod is a very good option because they have pre-configured ComfyUI templates, which makes the setup very easy. Another option is Vast.ai, sometimes you can find cheaper deals there than on Runpod.\n​One pro-tip: Always remember to 'Stop' your machine after you finish your work, otherwise the bill will keep running. When the machine is 'stopped', you are only charged for storage. What is your main use-case? Based on that, it will be easier to decide on the VRAM (16GB vs 24GB)",

You need an api key.\n\nOther local model enhancements:\n\n* `/promptmode set <full/concise/auto>`\n   * full: full, long system prompt with verbose instructions and lots of examples\n   * concise: short, abbreviated prompt for conserving context space and decreasing latency, particularly for local models. Dynamically constructed to only include instructions/examples for tools from the currently activated /toolset.\n   * auto: automatically uses concise prompt when using LM Studio endpoint and full prompt when using OpenRouter endpoint\n* `/toolset (list, show, activate/use, create, add, remove)` \\- use custom tool collections to exclude tools from being used and saving context space and decreasing latency, particularly with local models. Using the shell tool is often more efficient than using file tools.\n   * list: list available preset tool collections\n   * show : shows which tools are in a collection\n   * activate/use: Use a selected tool collection\n   * create: Create a new tool collection`/toolset create <name> [tool1, tool2, ...]` (Use tool names from /tools)\n   * add/remove: add/remove tool to/from a tool collection `/toolset add[remove] <name> tool`\n* `/promptinfo` \\- Show the current system prompt in a /view window (↑↓ to scroll, 'q' to quit viewer).\n\nIt's made to run efficiently and autonomously with local models, gpt-oss-120, 20, Qwen3-coder-30b, glm-45-air, and others work really well!  Honestly I don't see a huge difference in effectiveness between the concise prompt and the huge full system prompt, and often using just the shell tool, or in combination with WebSearch or Edit can be much faster and more effective than many of the other tools.\n\nI developed it to use on my 128gb Strix Halo system on Ubuntu, so I'm not sure it won't be buggy on other platforms (especially Windows).\n\nLet me know what you think!
