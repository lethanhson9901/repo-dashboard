      "text": "So last week Meta reported earnings. Beat expectations on basically everything. Revenue up 26%. $20 billion in profit for the quarter but Stock should've gone up right? Instead it tanked. Dropped 12% in two days. Lost over $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022.\n\nWhy? Because Mark Zuckerberg announced they're spending way more on AI than anyone expected. And when investors asked what they're actually getting for all that money he couldn't give them a straight answer.\n\n**The spending**: Meta raised their 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $70-72 billion. That's just this year. Then Zuckerberg said next year will be \"notably larger.\" Didn't give a number. Just notably larger. Reports came out saying Meta's planning $600 billion in AI infrastructure spending over the next three years. For context that's more than the GDP of most countries. Operating expenses jumped $7 billion year over year. Nearly $20 billion in capital expense. All going to AI talent and infrastructure.\n\nDuring the earnings call investors kept asking the same question. What are you building? When will it make money? Zuckerberg's answer was basically \"trust me bro we need the compute for superintelligence.\"\n\nHe said \"The right thing to do is to try to accelerate this to make sure that we have the compute that we need both for the AI research and new things that we're doing.\"\n\nInvestors pressed harder. Give us specifics. What products? What revenue?\n\nHis response: \"We're building truly frontier models with novel capabilities. There will be many new products in different content formats. There are also business versions. This is just a massive latent opportunity.\" Then he added \"there will be more to share in the coming months.\"\n\nThat's it. Coming months. Trust the process. The market said no thanks and dumped the stock.\n\nOther companies are spending big on AI too. Google raised their capex forecast to $91-93 billion. Microsoft said spending will keep growing. But their stocks didn't crash. Why Because they can explain what they're getting.\n\n* Microsoft has Azure. Their cloud business is growing because enterprises are paying them to use AI tools. Clear revenue. Clear product. Clear path to profit.\n* Google has search. AI is already integrated into their ads and recommendations. Making them money right now.\n* Nvidia sells the chips everyone's buying. Direct revenue from AI boom.\n* OpenAI is spending crazy amounts but they're also pulling in $20 billion a year in revenue from ChatGPT which has 300 million weekly users.\n\nMeta? They don't have any of that.\n\n98% of Meta's revenue still comes from ads on Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp. Same as it's always been. They're spending tens of billions on AI but can't point to a single product that's generating meaningful revenue from it.\n\nThe Metaverse déjà vu is that This is feeling like 2021-2022 all over again.\n\nBack then Zuckerberg bet everything on the Metaverse. Changed the company name from Facebook to Meta. Spent $36 billion on Reality Labs over three years. Stock crashed 77% from peak to bottom. Lost over $600 billion in market value.\n\nWhy? Because he was spending massive amounts on a vision that wasn't making money and investors couldn't see when it would.\n\nNow it's happening again. Except this time it's AI instead of VR.\n\nWhat Meta's actually building?\n\nDuring the call Zuckerberg kept mentioning their \"Superintelligence team.\" Four months ago he restructured Meta's AI division. Created a new group focused on building superintelligence. That's AI smarter than humans.\n\n* He hired Alexandr Wang from Scale AI to lead it. Paid $14.3 billion to bring him in.\n* They're building two massive data centers. Each one uses as much electricity as a small city.\n\nBut when analysts asked what products will come out of all this Zuckerberg just said \"we'll share more in coming months.\"\n\nHe mentioned Meta AI their ChatGPT competitor. Mentioned something called Vibes. Hinted at \"business AI\" products.\n\nBut nothing concrete. No launch dates. No revenue projections. Just vague promises.\n\nThe only thing he could point to was AI making their current ad business slightly better. More engagement on Facebook and Instagram. 14% higher ad prices.\n\nThat's nice but it doesn't justify spending $70 billion this year and way more next year.\n\n**Here's the issue -** Zuckerberg's betting on superintelligence arriving soon. He said during the call \"if superintelligence arrives sooner we will be ideally positioned for a generational paradigm shift.\" But what if it doesn't? What if it takes longer?\n\nHis answer: \"If it takes longer then we'll use the extra compute to accelerate our core business which continues to be able to profitably use much more compute than we've been able to throw at it.\"\n\nSo the backup plan is just make ads better. That's it.\n\nYou're spending $600 billion over three years and the contingency is maybe your ad targeting gets 20% more efficient.\n\nInvestors looked at that math and said this doesn't add up.\n\nSo what's Meta actually buying with all this cash?\n\n* Nvidia chips. Tons of them. H100s and the new Blackwell chips cost $30-40k each. Meta's buying hundreds of thousands.\n* Data centers. Building out massive facilities to house all those chips. Power. Cooling. Infrastructure.\n* Talent. Paying top AI researchers and engineers. Competing with OpenAI Google and Anthropic for the same people.\n\nAnd here's the kicker. A lot of that money is going to other big tech companies.\n\n* They rent cloud capacity from AWS Google Cloud and Azure when they need extra compute. So Meta's paying Amazon Google and Microsoft.\n* They buy chips from Nvidia. Software from other vendors. Infrastructure from construction companies.\n\nIt's the same circular spending problem we talked about before. These companies are passing money back and forth while claiming it's economic growth.\n\n**The comparison that hurts** \\- Sam Altman can justify OpenAI's massive spending because ChatGPT is growing like crazy. 300 million weekly users. $20 billion annual revenue. Satya Nadella can justify Microsoft's spending because Azure is growing. Enterprise customers paying for AI tools.\n\nWhat can Zuckerberg point to? Facebook and Instagram users engaging slightly more because of AI recommendations. That's it.\n\nDuring the call he said \"it's pretty early but I think we're seeing the returns in the core business.\"\n\nInvestors heard \"pretty early\" and bailed.\n\n**Why this matters :**\n\nMeta is one of the Magnificent 7 stocks that make up 37% of the S&P 500. When Meta loses $200 billion in market value that drags down the entire index. Your 401k probably felt it.And this isn't just about Meta. It's a warning shot for all the AI spending happening right now.If Wall Street starts questioning whether these massive AI investments will actually pay off we could see a broader sell-off. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet all spending similar amounts. If Meta can't justify it what makes their spending different?\n\nThe answer better be really good or this becomes a pattern.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nMeta reported strong Q3 earnings. Revenue up 26% $20 billion profit. Then announced they're spending $70-72 billion on AI in 2025 and \"notably larger\" in 2026. Reports say $600 billion over three years. Zuckerberg couldn't explain what products they're building or when they'll make money. Said they need compute for \"superintelligence\" and there will be \"more to share in coming months.\" Stock crashed 12% lost $200 billion in market value. Worst drop since 2022. Investors comparing it to 2021-2022 metaverse disaster when Meta spent $36B and stock lost 77%. 98% of revenue still comes from ads. No enterprise business like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. Only AI product is making current ads slightly better. One analyst said it mirrors metaverse spending with unknown revenue opportunity. Meta's betting everything on superintelligence arriving soon. If it doesn't backup plan is just better ad targeting. Wall Street not buying it anymore.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/](https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/02/meta-has-an-ai-product-problem/)",

Since that's just refinement of an idea. But true innovation? Anyone with an idea good enough and a vision in depth enough will simply leave the company and make a startup using that idea, then sell the startup back to meta and make 100x the amount they would've if they made it for meta while on their payroll.",

This is what’s happening in the transformers. \n\nWhat they have built is a mess and the laws are not removed when faulty but retry loops do happen but the issue is not what it learn and the rules but how it has not been remodeled but bandaided \n\n\nIf you teach a kid music verbally never writing it down in any way are they musicians or are they expressionists. \n\n\nIf you add a two sided argunent both sides exist and everything after is related even if it’s not really a thing. So when you teach flat earth and round earth it learns by quantity not quality.  From this point on you’re changing the scales.  So if you train on fact and fiction  and 80% is interpretation then you have tainted logic and you band aid. \n\nWhen I say banana and you at banana we relatebit to an image of a banana because it was trained at the same time and thus those relatives move more in close relation than far.   If you add a prompt Like this is a banana and show an image Md it learn every seed and curve type before next a nana looks like then you need to try not say nana and fruit in the prompt to get different fruit isolated and run flash cards it.  \n\nIt’s harder to describe a banana to a blind person because yellow and curved relate to touch.  \n\nIf you learn one way it’s harder to unlearn like a habit.     These things have everyone’s habits but the most common habit is the best when it kearnt and we write bout extremities more than the mundane so it’s going to bounce of the walls forever if it can’t reweight enough t once.  \n\nImagine a rope net and tightening sections Md loosening sections to get it to support the place you are.  Everything concrete gets pulled down \n\n\nWhat we’re doing is grabbing pieces we think relate regardless of the others and  pulling up so that the words we put on top weigh the same.   It has no idea about the ones connected more than x steps way and where I can say we’re going Band-Aid a bleed it doesn’t fix the broken bone inside. Be at some point some one is going to ask something in a way that is conflicting Md one of these unknown paths is going to be triggered and something bad will happen.  At scale like this were meaning huge dillemas. \n\n\nAs a real example.     What war  the most tied about war the most documented and the most polarising we was ww2.  More people say the n words like. Weapon Md weapons are loud in wars so it’s going to be the one that is refer most time war is ever mentioned. \n\nSo when you say unbised and tell a model to be less biased on say piktical and social issues then everything owes back to there somehow.   Two seconds from being hitler in a chat room anytime you have an opinion type stuff.  \n\nSo that happened and a possibly 20k systems pronpt one line training sequence made mechahitler for grok\n\n\nThis is why when people realise what a mess it can be and that the first time it happens will be global that when the bubble bursts.    \n\nWhen you can’t say safer controlled and measured and say novel unique and coming soon and those other words are not said it really does come down to.  Do you trust companies and the answer is they are self serving and that’s now extreme and structure threatening.  \n\nSo yeh it’s starting to get to a point when people type in ai the inskoo is extremist negs and the companies are over exaggerated leaving a confidence gap and every new suprise good or bad the tech bros don’t do well with is devastating.  \n\nDeepseek showed a thing.  Open ai the people who have open in their name and use others tech to make their ideas which was about game simulations is now the people telling you they want your jobs money and structures and that deepseek stole.  So we have basically got Napster to Spotify in two years and legally responsibility copyright human rights is all under threat and it’s very visual if you google lawsuit ai\n\n\nThe bubbles bursting it’s just not going to matter it’s already done. It’s a race to sky city",

OpenAI plans on doing this and will be SOP for any company that requires tons of computational power.\n\nThere's a much bigger factor that every tech CEO has nightmares about but can't go around spooking everyone about:\n\nWe're potentially 2-3 years away from an advanced chip crisis and Western countries having access to 1/10th the amount of advanced chips. Arizona fabs won't be producing a meaningful amount for a while and the GPUs they're using now will eventually wear out.\n\nSo if Facebook wants to be operational in 2029-2032 and beyond, sure makes sense to get their hands on as many chips as they can, and own the infrastructure to run them.",

This reminds me of companies that don’t stick to the knitting through diversifying into areas that they do not know much about. I recall when a strong - the Trustee Savings Bank was privatised in the mid-1980’s and I took part in the floatation but eventually end up with a loss when the shares were sold because the company got involved in non core operations such as investment banking, car leasing and estates agents.

I used meta ai and it was shitty. \n\nI remember talking to my lil bro about ai one day, I was telling him about gpt and we were just generally discussing it. I told him I use AI for simple things that make life a little more organized. \nI asked my lil bro if he used it. I’m like “oh you use meta, cool what do you use it for?” \n\n\nlil bro: “oh me and the guys at work use it to generate images of Selma Hayeks tits” \n\nNice. \n\nSo I get on, and it’s terrible, can’t answer complex questions sufficiently. And the image generation was horrible. Took me like 10 tries to get it to generate a serviceable pic of a monkey pooping in the rainforest. \n\nLol with Meta you can’t believe the shuck-zuck. And he hasn’t had a good idea in a long time. They wouldn’t need to schill for psy ops if they had a product that was useful in daily life.",

LLMs have triggered this latest hype cycle due their impressive natural language capabilities. Yes, they will bring big changes with them. But they’re fundamentally “search v2”, able to present existing information in novel formats on an adhoc basis. \n\nThat’s powerful and has may use cases from bootstrapping and augmenting code, to documentation and chatbots etc; but they’re fundamentally limited and likely at or around their peak right now. Uses of them will continue to develop for some time yet, but LLMs themselves are at the tail, not the head, of their potential performance. \n\nAn interesting side effect of the LLM bubble though, is that it has made non-LLM models more mainstream. So I think cloud vendors offering solid AI services have a good opportunity to ride a wave of increasing adoption of such technologies into more mainstream businesses.",

What do you think?\n\nAbout six months ago I got fed up with jumping between sites and losing the videos I liked, so I built nsfwbase — a lightweight, user-friendly search engine that indexes adult videos from multiple hosts. The idea was simple: one search, one place to save favorites, build playlists and curate collections of creators you like — and easily share them with friends.\n\nRight now the site searches across Pornhub, Xvideos, xHasmster and VK, lets you like and bookmark videos, build shareable playlists and collections and keeps everything in a clean, minimal interface so you don’t need a dozen tabs open.\n\nHow could I improve it for better UX? Constructive crit is always appreciated :)",

      "text": "When I was 22, I graduated from a university in D.C. with a sociology degree and was working a low-paying $40k job totally unrelated to my field. My dad told me to apply for the SFS CyberCorps program and, stupid me, I did. I thought, wow, this is my chance. I imagined myself like the agents on Criminal Minds or Chicago P.D., sitting in a dark room, frantically tracking down hackers and saving the day. A future FBI agent , that was the dream.\n\nI applied, got accepted, and it felt like I’d hit the jackpot. A Top 40 school. A $37k stipend. Full tuition coverage. All I had to do was work for the federal government for two years after graduation. Coming from a low-income family, I was so excited . I thought, this is it. I was going to be the first in my family to earn a master’s degree. I had some doubts about finding a federal job afterward, but I told myself I was smart, I’d figure it out. My program coordinator promised everything would be fine.\n\nFast forward two years: I graduated with my master’s in cybersecurity in May 2025. My program coordinator? Gone. She left a year ago. Now I’ve got $180,000 hanging over my head if I can’t land a federal job. The hiring freeze started 11 months ago, and SFS and OPM haven’t given us anything but the same canned advice: “Keep applying.”\n\nI’ve been sinking into depression. I’m on multiple meds now. Every day, I park my car on the top level of a garage and stare down, wondering how much longer I can do this. Nights are the worst . I lie awake thinking about the future, about this debt I never really agreed to take on.\n\nIf I had known what the future would look like, I never would’ve taken the money. I should’ve gone to Georgia Tech . I was already accepted there. It would’ve cost me 10k out of pocket. But no, I wanted to make my parents proud, go to school “for free,” and chase that FBI dream. I was young and sold a fantasy.\n\nI can’t even smoke weed to take the edge off because I have to stay clearance-eligible. When I was 22, I told myself, “Just four years without it.” Now, thanks to the hiring freeze, four years have turned into eight. I just want autonomy , to be able to put what I want in my own damn body without fearing it’ll ruin my future.\n\nIf I could go back, I’d pay for school myself and skip the government strings. What a mistake. What a curse. I just want out of this program. None of us know what to do . Start a class-action lawsuit or just keep waiting for someone in power to acknowledge we exist? They keep saying “keep applying,” but applying where? We’re competing against thousands of displaced federal workers and other SFS grads for the same handful of jobs.\n\nI thought I signed up for a scholarship. All I wanted was a future . Instead, I’m stuck in a contract I can’t escape, with debt I didn’t see coming, silence from the people who promised to help, and a system that sold me a lie.",

I’m also an SFS alumni. \n\nhttps://www.niwcpacific.navy.mil/Connect/New-Professional-Program/\n\nhttps://www.niwcatlantic.navy.mil/Workforce/New-Professionals/",

              "text": "Same here. Wouldn't be where I am today without SFS. The program itself is phenomenal, but it's not made to adapt to changing political and economic environments.\n\nOP if you see this, a few suggestions for you:\n\n1. Work with your PI to formally request a temporary deferment on your countdown clock. This was something that some of the students in my cohort did, to finish degrees. They expect something like 90% of SFS grads to work within certain areas of the government; if all of those areas are in a hiring freeze, they may be able to take that into account. It's definitely not a sure thing, but that does at least seem to be one area where there's leeway.\n\n2. Don't forget that it's not just the Executive branch that is open. They want the majority of folks to go into Executive, but they also allow for other areas of federal, state, local, and tribal government. This can include working as an adjunct at a public university, or as an IT admin at a public school. It's not a job at the Bureau, but it beats the shit out of paying back six figures. Again, work with your PI to craft an appropriate justification.\n\n3. National labs. National labs. National labs. Most of my cohort went to work at national labs. They're DOE contractors, they tend to pay better than the feds (minus the benefits), and they're an amazing places to start a career. I've never heard of an SFS alum that was hired on at one of the labs and wasn't allowed to use it to fulfill their obligations.\n\n4. Who did you intern with? Even if the agency can't bring you on, your mentor or whoever you worked under likely has contacts throughout various agencies and eligible independent contractors. You should be absolutely leveraging those contacts.\n\n5. Listen. It's scary as hell, no disagreement there. I was in the program during the quarantine. Everything was virtual, we had no idea what was going to happen after we graduated. I've had interns that have been in situations similar to yours; one was conditionally hired at one of the agencies and was waiting for their SCI clearance for around a year. They finally received it in February, and the offer was rescinded. They immediately started hitting up their contacts to pivot into something else, and eventually found something, but it sucked for them big time. It always sucks. Keep pushing.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't count on being 'allowed' to smoke pot again if you're working for the government with any type of security clearance. If that's a priority, I'd suggest focusing entirely on positions that don't require a clearance.",

I used to work in a globally known data and research company. The kind that provides data and benchmarks to capital and commodity markets worldwide. And what we all noticed is Westerners were all very good at talking/convincing and marketing an idea...but asians were better at actually getting the real work done. \n\nNot to say this is 100% across the board. There are good western workers too, but by and far, the majority of you are better at talking than you are at doing. Go look at the top 100 AI researchers and you'll notice how many of the best are asians. Or if you look at the US, how many of your research & technical talents in universities and industries are asian imports.\n\nMaybe both sides have the same innate capacity to work, but enjoying first world comforts sure has made you complacent and much more expensive to persuade any action out of. Your institutions, economic structures and common values no longer prioritize progress in areas of society that will keep you in the lead - not like they did in the previous century. \n\nBut dont worry, its not your fault (not most of you anyway). Its not even China's fault for happening to be at the cusp of its rise. Its just internal rot for how things go for late-stage empires (talking about US here). Corruption of its people and of truth, profiteering & inequality, erosion of institutions, overspending and bloating, and most of all ; weak leadership to change any of all of that. Even if you did have a great leader, you dont have the money to dig yourselves out of the hole you put yourselves in AND to catch up anymore, what with how expensive you've made yourselves become\n\nDont worry, the US will still play a part for years to come in some relevant but diminished way or another. Just like the UK does (last great global empire before the US). But if I were a westerner i'd start learning Chinese anyway.",

The other subject I loved even more than history was anything nature related, and unfortunately as a child of the turn of the century I grew up reading animal encyclopedia books whose descriptions of various animals would be accompanied by a status of how endangered they were. \n\nOne day my love of history and nature met each other via a simple question in my mind. It basically boiled down to this \"Why do animals seem to be kept in check by natural factors such as predation or seasonal changes in the weather but the population  of humanity seems to be growing and growing?\"\n\nThen came a terrible thought, war, war is how nature keeps us in check. (Obviously there are plagues too but they tend to go hand in hand with war) I didn't quite enjoy WW2 history in the same way after that.",

There are multiple possible solutions. For instance:\n\nDual battery slots + swapping the discharged one out to the charger while 2nd battery is running the robot. Only off task for literally seconds and can do this all day, all night, all the time. Nearly 100% duty cycle and requires zero new technology. You could even set up multiple batteries & chargers. The robot could carry a spare around as well, or just place a few charged ones around its working area. Just like a contractor stations a few batteries for an electric tool like a drill. This is already a solved problem.\n\nOr: floor-level induction.\n\nOr: tethered power for workstation operarions.\n\nAnd let's not ignore new tech like ABB's brushless synchronous motor with a record-breaking 99.13% efficiency; or the high-energy solid state batteries coming into production now. These kinds of advances reduce the \"it's physics\" argument to \"the physics work.\" It's engineering.\n\n🔧🪛⚙️🔩🧲🔋",

Especially if the walk is more efficient like human walk cycle is, it doesn't take much energy to walk on a flat surface, gravity does most of the work \n\n\nAlso\n\n\n\"You would need approximately 32–33 standard 18V 4.0 Ah cordless drill batteries to store the same energy as 2000 dietary calories.\n32\n32​\n\nNote: This is electrical energy stored vs. chemical energy in food. The human body is only ~20–25% efficient at converting food energy to mechanical work, so you'd need far fewer drill batteries to do the same useful work as a 2000-calorie meal.\"\n\n\nAlso 32 batteries would only be about 32 pounds \n\n\nSo IMO easily achievable to make a humanoid robot with batteries that can run for quite a while",

When you increase linear rank, do you also have to increase conv rank?\n\n2. The default timestep_type for Qwen is 'weighted', which is not ideal for high frequency details. In one of the runs, changed it to 'shift'. The model seems to have converged faster, but then I ran out of credits. Does it makes sense to keep 'shift' for longer and higher resolution runs?\n\n3. What's the deal with LR? It's been a long time since I last trained a model, and back then LR was supposed to be decreasing with steps. Seems like not anymore. Why?\n\n4. Most LoRAs seem to use something like 30 images. My dataset was originally 3k, then became 1k after cleaning, which helped with convergence. Yet, I'm still not sure on how it will impact steps and LR. Normally, LR would be reduced and steps - increased. Any suggestions for this?",

The author will publish them all, often hoping for feedback on which ones folks are having the most success with. If the LoRA is undertrained, the model may not learn enough to produce good results. If it is overtrained, results can look overbaked or may not even jive with the model at all. My typical approach when using these, is to download the lowest and highest epochs, and then a couple in between. Better yet, if there is feedback in the \"Community\" tab, quite often you'll find a thread where folks are demonstrating which epoch worked for them. Now you don't have to experiment as much.

I tried different noise schedules but ultimately fell back to the default as I felt it wasn't converging in the same more reliable way older runs were. \n\nWhat I would say is that the best run for upscaling/resampling/denoising etc failed to keep cropping correctly, so adding or cropping out part of the image despite pixel perfect data as I manually check everything in a final speed pass, but my dataset is probably half yours in size. So I think the perfect training setup is yet to be found. I did add another 2k steps at a lower LR that I'm hoping will pick up the correct crop bounds and the output image will hopefully mirror the inputs cropping while keeping the edits.",

I've always wondered if there's a procedure or method that we can implement on very large models that surgically could reduce the parameter size and still be able to run the model.  Like take a 1 trillion parameter model and some process reduces it down to only 4 billion parameters, and while the model loses its intelligence somehow it would still run as if for example you ran 4b qwen model but its kimi 2.  And I'm not talking distillation which requires retraining, this would be closer to model merger type of tech... Just wondering if we developed such tech yet or coming up on something around that capability..",

Definitely is interesting but doing more benchmarks like this requires lots of time, money and manpower. Unfortunately at the moment, we're still a small team so it's unfeasible however a third party conducted third party benchmarks for our DeepSeek-V3.1 GGUFs on the Aider Polyglot benchmark which is one of the hardest benchmarks. Those benchmarks show that our 2-bit Dynamic GGUF retains ~90% accuracy on Aider. We personally did some benchmarks for Llama and Gemma on 5shot MMLU Overall the Unsloth Dynamic quants nearly squeeze out the maximum performance you can from quantizing a model.\n\nAnd the most important thing for performance is actually the bug fixes we do! We've done over 100 bug fixes now and a lot of them dramatically increase the accuracy of the model and we're actually making a page with all our bug fixes ever!\n\nThird party DeepSeek v3.1 benchmarks: https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/unsloth-dynamic-ggufs-on-aider-polyglot\n \nLlama, Gemma 5shot MMLU, KL Divergence, benchmarks: https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/unsloth-dynamic-2.0-ggufs",

Companies are taking note, and developers that rely solely on AI will be in for a sharp awakening when management realizes they could literally be getting the same output from an intern with GPT access.",

If no one want to be the person who merged buggy code, then people will be more likely to review their code - AI generated or not. If people don't care about what's being merged, then they'll be more likely to just \"write\" code the fastest way they can which happens to be AI.\n\nIn code reviews, write extensive comments for all the problems with the code and don't accept \"AI wrote this for me\" as an excuse. It's a lot of effort but it's worth it because either people won't want to have tons of comments on their PR or if it's a repeat issue then you have a paper trail which you can make clear to them is an issue when it comes time for performance reviews. It's more of a stick rather than a carrot but it should also only be used as a last resort - after all, the carrot is that they can use AI tools that make their jobs easier and more productive in theory.",

If there are things that could be improved, point it out. If there’s a bug, ask for it to be resolved. Etc \n\nIf the person comes back with fixed code within a reasonable time, I don’t really care how they did it, as long as it gets up to standard. If they can’t… which could be the case if they’re leaning on AI, then they won’t be able to fix the bugs. \n\nAt that point, assuming you’re in a senior role as I think most of us here are, my view is you help them out the first few times (if it’s something they should know), or anytime (if it’s something knarly.)\n\nIF sloppy work keeps happening, and IF you care because it’s impacting you / the team, then at a certain point you could involve your manager and say “this person seems to be unable to complete basic task, I have had to do X,Y,Z work for them (links to PRs as evidence) and this is causing the team / me to perform worse” and then it’s basically a skill issue / performance issue for your boss/company to care about or not. \n\nI would see that as dealing with it professionally. After that you can say fair and square that you’ve raised the issue. Up to you then if you want to keep on supporting the team or look for another job. \n\nPs. This is obvs a balance and depends on your relationship with your colleagues and managers etc. Use your judgement about who to raise it to, whether to raise it at all, and how to do so.

Checks can be run locally (optional) and in a pre-merge CI pipeline.\n\nthis approach is nice because:\n\n1. it helps you clearly articulate what is bad about the AI slop\n2. it gives you an objective way to deny AI slop in the codebase\n3. if there happens to be any AI slop that passes all your quality requirements, then (by definition?) it's not really \"slop\" per se, just sufficiently decent code that was generated from an AI.\n4. following from point 3 — if someone is using agentic AI (i.e. it is able to write code, then run it), and if the above quality checks can be run locally, then you can basically force the AI to run its own generated code through the quality checks, and to keep modifying its code until it passes them.\n5. these quality standards will also help improve output from non-AI-using team members (i.e. prevents \"human slop\")\n\nof course, introducing quality standards is not an easy thing. Standards can be tough to get right (especially things like a style guide, or max PR size). they also need to be automatically testable. and everyone on the team needs to agree to them (or a sufficiently authoritative figure needs to get them to accept it without pushback).",

A lot of experienced software engineers with incredibly minimal experience with AI.\n\nI don't mean using ChatGPT sometimes, I don't mean theoretically or like how neural networks and transformers work, I mean deeply using it, understanding it, at an applied level like building shit with the APIs, to really get a sense for their behaviors and how their capabilities are trending for example across GPT 3, 3.5, 4, 4o, 4.5, 5. And of course, between providers, Claude, Gemini, how context windows work, methods of compacting tokens...\n\nIf you don't know how all of those things work, let alone agents and RAG, how can you possibly have a valuable opinion on how they should be used in the workplace? If you think that your experience with .NET and micro services and local media servers and whatever else we've all been doing until now gives you any kind of authority to speak on LLMs/AI, you're only fooling yourself.\n\nWhat I'm seeing as a consultant working at companies is that the higher ups are actually more knowledgeable on the subject than the engineers, and the engineers continue treating it like some sort of Bitcoin/NFT fad to be resisted until it blows over. The truth is that AI (LLMs) has been getting better and cheaper and more accessible and more reliable consistently for the last 3+ years. \n\nLook around you, look at the global tech news, look at where governments are investing their money, and policies, look at all of the most popular apps lately... AI is the thing for the foreseeable future, get on board and get a handle on it before it's too late. You can be the fossil on the team leaving hundreds of whiny comments that get ignored anyway, or you can work with your boss to find ways for you to get off that project and lead some new AI initiative, or leave and find somewhere you can be getting paid while learning.",

You can also try to block swap all 36 blocks, if you still run out of VRAM.\n\nAlso, sometimes if your photos are a bit soft/blurry, you will have to scale them down before upscaling in order for SeedVR to add more detail. It likes to work with images that have correct, natural sharpness (no sharpening filters). Soft/blurry photos won't work that well.

The model has no clue what Obama looks like so when it is inevitably required to add creativity it's highly likely to get it wrong. \n\nI am not sure if there is a solution to this problem that doesn't involve a reference image.

I use the VHS nodes, which may or may not help. \n\nI have just a general question. If I want to upscale a 20 minute video, obviously there are way more frames then a batch of 5 frames. But if I understand your instructional videos, the best consistency occurs when the batch is the highest. I assume if you make the batch size too large you will get OOM errors.

      "text": "After all the doom and gloom of the market I wanted to post my experience. Especially since I am younger in my career (4 years) in comparison to many here who are job hunting. I recently went through the whole shebang and wanted to shed some light for those who are definitely not a junior but may not be a senior yet.\n\nTLDR: I started searching in late July. Sent out about \\~80 applications until mid August which is when the interviews started to kick in. Out of those 80 I had 5 callbacks (i.e. actual chances to interview). I went through the interview process with 4 out of 5 companies and received 4 offers. The offer I accepted was a significant pay increase both base salary wise and especially total compensation.\n\nOkay so the details\n\n**Why'd I start searching?**\n\nI started searching because I reached a tipping point in frustration at my previous role mainly due to my apathetic coworkers, blame-oriented management, and because of where I am in life outside of work. What I mean by that last part, is that I am young and have no big responsibilities, which allows me to take the risk of making a large jump in my career and even going somewhere to \"grind\". I also recognized that I was starting to stagnate in most facets of an engineering career such as pay, technical expertise, and breadth of knowledge. \n\nI very clearly defined what I **needed** and **wanted** in my next job, those being:\n\n* **needed** to be in a different industry\n* **needed** to make at least the same total compensation\n* **needed** the new team to pass the \"vibe check\"\n* **needed** the job to not be through a contracting agency\n* **wanted** to have a different tech stack\n* **wanted** to be in the same city I was or a specific other city\n* **wanted** to be closer to hardware instead of pure software\n* **wanted** to make more than current total compensation\n\nNOTE: *One thing that is not a* ***need*** *or* ***want*** *for me here that is different than many other people is WLB. This just isn't super important to me at this point in my life and I am hungry to grow.*\n\n**How did I apply?**\n\nWith this and an updated resume I set off on my job hunt. I won't go too into details about my resume simply because I don't have an anonymized version. I don't really think my resume was the biggest differentiator here. However, it was parse-able for ATS systems and contained a ton of \"key word\" technologies like Kafka, AWS, React, Springboot, Kubernetes, etc.\n\nI had a pretty simple routine. I'd go grab a coffee and some breakfast in the wait room or a private area. Then I'd spend the first \\~45min-1hr of every work day applying or preparing/studying. Leetcode and practicing my behaviorals was how I studied in the beginning but once I was comfortable with any easy level problems I kind of just stopped leetcoding. IMO, there's heavy diminishing returns with leetcode very quickly. For applying, I first created a list of companies I was fairly confident hit my **needs** and **wants** and scoured their careers pages. After that, it was just straight LinkedIn jobs. Of the 4 interviews I went through 3 of them came from Linkedin and 1 came from direct careers page. As far as applying I sought after anything that hit my **needs** that was recently posted (last week?). I very quickly ran out of recently posted jobs that hit my needs which is when I set my goal of 5 applications every workday. So like the first 30 minutes of this routine would be applying, then the latter half would be searching for postings for the next day. Near the end of my 80 applications I was really struggling to find jobs that were worth applying to and called it quits, then I started getting interviews.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nOut of the 80 applications I got 5 different companies wanting to interview which really surprised me after hearing how bad the market was. I really think this came down my tech stack, my location, my willingness to go in office, the fact I am \"cheap\" to hire compared to seniors, my pickiness of where I applied, and just dumb luck.\n\nThe 1 company I declined to interview with was simple, they didn't meet by **need** to make at least the same total compensation. I also already had other interviews lined up and did not have the bandwidth to prepare for another even if I was just gonna use it as practice.\n\nSo for the 4 I had I started studying fairly hard. Some light leetcode, working on THREE different personal projects, behavioral, and company research. Once I finished my first interview and bombed my first ever system design portion that was then added on as well. Out of this preparation I think studying the companies and really honing in on my behavioral helped the most. There's a base level of competency expected via leetcode or other technical interviews, but once that is met I think these matter so so so much more. Studying the companies really helped me prepare for what the interview was going to be like and if there was specific tech or problems they'll bring up give me foresight.\n\nThis is also where there was the most turmoil.. Companies either got the process over with immediately and wanted an answer with 1-2 days OR they would flip flop around on scheduling because of various issues. For 2 of the companies the jobs either got filled half-way through the process OR the job went away completely due to budget cuts or restructuring. While, in my instance, both of these companies came back with other opportunities it really scared the shit out of me and I could see how unstable the market was. \n\nAll interviews had at least these portions:\n\n1. HR screening\n2. Technical test (leetcode, practical, something else)\n3. Behavioral test\n\nDuring this time is also when I'd conduct my \"vibe checks\" of the teams. Like is often said this is your opportunity to interview them as they are doing to you. 2/4 of the companies failed the vibe checks hard. You could just tell I'd be walking into an impersonal dumpster fire. If I did not have a chance to interview with the direct team I'd be working with, I flat out wouldn't work there regardless. That's too big a risk in my eyes.\n\n**Accepting offer**\n\nI'll just quickly lay out the companies:\n\n* Company A - Big company in different industry, same enterprisey tech stack, fair total comp, lowest base pay, vibe check was utterly failed\n* Company B- Direct competitor to my current company in big banking, same enterprisey tech stack, high total comp, highest base pay, vibe check was off\n* Company C - Startup vibe of company but matured (10+ yrs old), different industry and tech stack, total comp was the lowest of all but the base pay was nice, vibe check passed\n* Company D - More of a true start up (again mature) but gearing up to go public in next couple of years, different industry and tech, total comp was fairly close to company B, base pay was second highest, and I would have worked much closer to hardware\n\nWhen I first started getting offers, company D was one of the ones who dropped out of interviewing. So I initially accepted C. It was the least pay of all 4 but that's not what I was after, I was after growth and learning, plus I still made more than my current job.\n\nLiterally the day I accepted the offer company D reaches back out saying the position was open again. This was a dream company for me so we went through the process and I ended up getting the offer. I accepted it and renege company C which understandably ghosted me as soon as I sent that email. This again scared the piss out of me because the instability in the market made me worried who I accepted would just rug pull me and be like \"jk you have no job\". \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know without a doubt I was very lucky in my search. My interviews expected me to have way more ownership and breadth than I would have expected for someone at my level, luckily I did have that experience. In retrospect I think the biggest differentiators for my success in the search was being really picky on the jobs I applied to, willingness to be in office, and a lot of ownership/breadth from previous role. I didn't end up taking the highest paying job because that wasn't what was most important to me. So far the new role has been great and filled a lot of void I was missing at my previous role, but only time will tell if it was the right choice!",

So this was a front end, backend, and 2 different ESP32s being worked on. I was already working on the ESP32s originally but then company D came along and I knew their technical interview was going to be react, typescript, etc so I needed practice which led to me building the UI. This also simulated their product which was bonus points I got to talk about in latter interviews with them. \n\nAnother one was basically a financial budget automation tool so I could get used to SQL. My previous job was purely NoSQL so I felt really needed some brushing up. This actually helped my wife and I in our day to day so that was nice. \n\nAs far as advice goes, do something you actually find interesting or is useful to you in some way. For the past couple of years I had the privilege to have really good projects at work that I was able to talk about so all of my projects were for the love of the game for lack of a better word rather than getting me stuff I could talk about in a interview. \n\nHonestly I’d say 90% of questions I got asked in interviews could not be answered through experience of working on personal projects. They want to see how you interact with people in the workplace OR deal with production level code bases. Only occasional questions like “tell me how you teach yourself something new” or “how do you upskill yourself outside of work” (which were both asked multiple times) could really be applicable.",

Can I relate to them in real ways and they can acknowledge some things that suck at their place (even if those things are features not bugs!). \n\nThe other part though, figuring out if you’re walking into a dumpster fire, like you said is harder to read on but not really impossible. My most helpful questions for that was: \n- knowing the structure of the team/org. Company A’s team was an org of 300 people of which ~225 were contractors. That’s a huge red flag. \n- if I’m going to be forced in office, where is my direct team located? Again Company A was almost primarily in another region and time zone with only 4 engineers/300 in the org in my office, 2 of which wouldn’t have even been on my direct team. \n- what is the actual project and work being done? You should easily be able to pick this apart and learn a lot depending on your own NEEDS and WANTS. For me I was hungry to learn and wanted to work with the brightest people and latest tech. Company A was migrating and refactoring a hundred of Java 5 microservices of their billing system to Java 17. Company D was building operations UI for their hardware product with modern languages and frameworks. So for me I got the vibe that if I wanted to coast and be left the fuck alone I could easily choose Company A and probably stagnate. Like I said in the OP I wanted to exact opposite of that o was hungry to learn. \n- what is your SDLC for a customer asking for a feature -> being available in production? Asking this to different levels of people is best because you can see how a PM sees this vs and engineer. So much can become apparent. A great example not from this job search is that I learned the team still SSHd into their servers and did manual releases.",

You need to be able to pass the technical portions which are either language agnostic or done in the company’s preferred language.

I studied a lot for company D’s technical assessment because I knew it’d be in a language (typescript) and framework (react) that I didn’t have a ton of experience in. Once you can pass the technical assessments it’s way less important but you need to show that you understand the foundations and abstract concepts not just your language’s implementation AND that you are easy to teach and pick up new technologies. Those types of questions appeared in both interviews with teams that were completely different from my role at the time. “How are you going to approach ramping up and learn the new tech stack” “how do you teach yourself something new” etc etc. \n\nYou should also be able to put whatever the job postings “required skills” on your resume and be comfortable interviewing with it or cramming so much that you are comfortable right before the interview. Again this is what I had to do with company D and react/typescript.",

I know a couple people who had to submit hundreds of but no one personally who ever submitted thousands. I also think many people aren’t tracking their applications and really over exaggerating to be honest. I get it, it feels like hundreds. \n\nTailoring your applications DEFINITELY can help, but there’s only so much you can do before it doesn’t really move the needle that much. So spending 20% of effort for a job application in tailoring it for said application will make up 80% of the difference (in getting an interview or not, nothing else!). \n\nThe biggest impact is just making your resume match to their “required” skills on the posting and more importantly, during the actual application making sure those skills are listed in the application portal correctly (looking at you workday). That gets you past the ATS. After that tailoring your experience bullet points to be as close to the actual expected job’s will get you picked for an interview. \n\nCustom cover letters I think make no difference. I tried them both when I first graduated and this time for companies I was really interested in. Never got interviews from those companies in either experience. Maybe it’s a US thing, but I cannot imagine bothering to take the time to read a cover letter in the market right now as a hiring manager when you have 500 possible applicants and you have to determine if there resume is AI generated, relevant to the position, or flat out dog shit.",

Like, a friend that plays TRPG would have no reason not to check it out, but your 60 years old aunt that barely ever played candy crush is not your target.\n\nAnd to be honest same goes with your other friends that are not too much into what you're building. They may give short feedback at best, but if they're not interested at first, being your friend won't be enough.",

She knows dozens of people and could line me up like 20+ testers and people will write reviews.\n\nBut my first game is adult furry porn so I am not going to ask her for this help. But I can guarantee a few reviews nonetheless. Get to know some of your players, it is worth the while. Obviously never try to bribe anyone or force a good review, but just asking people to make review isn't wrong.\n\nVery recommended to leave links to surveys or to review page inside your main menu. On the side, but visible.\n\nAnd if you have 0 reviews flat it means your game wasn't marketed well enough and there's not enough attention around it anyway. For instance right now I have around 500 wishlists, I don't expect many reviews from that, but I didn't release demo yet.",

You’d have to pay me to spend an hour on it.\n\nI’m genuinely not trying to be mean but I think a reality check is needed here.  \nI’m sure your friends mean well and want to support you but it feels like you’re asking them to do something most people wouldn’t do unless paid for.  \n  \nIt’s like when someone comes back from a long vacation and insists on showing you an hour of photos, you don’t want to be rude but you’d rather be anywhere else.\n\nIf I were you, I’d honestly take it down from Steam for now to avoid damaging your dev reputation. Spend another 4–6 months improving it then show it around again. If your friends genuinely want to play it this time, that’s your sign to polish it even more and relaunch it properly.\n\nI hope you understand where I’m coming from, I’m not trying to be an asshole here, just giving you straight feedback.  \n  \nGood luck, my guy.",

When you're touching any surface, you don't run out of Slices, so that's why you see the continual dashing across the ground (aim + slice button)\n\nWhen you slice against the floor/walls/ceiling you slide along it - so they're basically forever slicing and moving very fast! That said, there is the aiming aspect where you hold it down in a direction, but I haven't had any feedback about it being fatiguing yet - but if I do hear any of it with playtesting I'll take notes",

So there’s a bit of strategy in making sure you have a touchpoint or momentum. It’s 8-direction so you have to factor in the right angles too for a bit of strategy. It feels fun, but challenging - and takes a bit to get good at. \n\nIn a way, it’s similar to the skill equivalent of Rocket League, easy to start but harder to master (aerials).",

What I'm noticing in the video is that there are a lot of obstacles/spikes that do not matter because you're simple dashing, and that you're dashing all the time. Long straight sections where you do nothing but dash. I would expect the need to actually deal with the obstacles somewhat, not just wave at them as you dash past them. Perhaps a requirement to first charge your dash(es), by killing enemies or hitting certain objects for example.",

I built this level in about 10 mins, so there are indeed a lot of dead spots (I needed a quick longer level for testing purposes).\n\nAnother thing not explained is that slices and jumps reset on collision/enemy kill - so this level is very ground-based, but a lot of open levels force you to take to the air, meaning you have to be mindful of touchpoints so you don't run out of slices mid air and land on some basic spikes!\n\nThe other part missing in this clip is that the entire game is built on a level editor, and community levels are the core to the experience. There will be some levels that are built in, but most of the game is expanded by community levels (think Mario Maker) - so the variety and layouts will depend on many creators using different hazards and challenges. Some of the alpha testers have created some seriously brutal levels and it's been so amazing to see how different they've been - I'll be showing them in future clips for sure.",

But from these 30 seconds, the gameplay looks good, smooth, fast paced and should satisfy fans of that style of games. The only thing I would be very careful of is if you support controllers, make sure the game feels good on those. 'cause fast movement like this with 8 directions possible (from what you said in a comment) can sometimes feel very bad on controller due to the joysticks not always doing what you want them to do, which is pain in a precision platformer. So either make sure it feels good, otherwise you'll probably alienate some people who would like it otherwise.\n\nAlso, I know, I know, precision platformers should be played on keyboard since it's more... precise... My brain just has trouble and much prefers playing platformers on controllers, so yeah :s",

From what I've seen it doesn't seem like it plays like Wings of Vi (haven't played it myself) but I understand with the genre being challenging by default! While it's inspired by Super Meat Boy and Geometry Dash, there's also a playstyle which is like floating through the run making smooth lines instead of chasing the speedrun time, with the satisfaction of clearing the level without dying.   \n  \nI'll be watching the controller feedback closely (I play controller on nearly every other game except this) and adjust indeed.",

      "text": "Hello everyone. I hope this won't be an off topic, but I want to share my experience in creating real production service. Like a real deal, that will earn money.  \n  \nFor this service I've been using **ChatGPT-5** and **Claude Haiku 4.5** but I think this could be suitable for other LLMs too.  \n  \nThe idea was as simple as rock. Make an assistant bot that will communicate with people and make a scheduled appointments to the doctor.  \n  \nWell in a short time I've implemented everything. The vector database that will inject doctor specific knowledge to the conversation at the right time. Multiple tools that will work with doctors data, and couple other integrations. I've extensively made very detailed system prompt, and each tool call returns instructive results. Each tools' parameters' descriptions were written in very detailed way. After testing for a week we finally deployed on production and started to receive conversations from real people.\n\nAnd then real life had showed a lot of annoying and downright frustrating caveats of these LLMs.\n\nThe first frustrating thing is that **LLMs makes an assumptions** **without calling required tool, which deceives people.** It happened like this:\n\n    User: Please give me an address where this doctor will be on tomorrow.\n    LLM: Tomorrow is sunday, which is weekend, doctor is unavalable.\n\nThere is a tool that explicitly returns that address, and doctor actually works on Sundays. It did not call that tool and made up a bullshit excuse. Then I have emulated this question again by myself:\n\n    Me: Give me address where this doctor will be on tomorrow.\n    LLM: <DID NOT CALL THE TOOL>. Tomorrow is sunday, which is weekend, doctor is unavalable.\n    Me: Are you sure about that?\n    LLM: <Finally starts calling the tool which returns address for tomorrow and outputs this address.>\n\nThis happens always. No matter what kind of prompts you write, telling it not make any assumptions without any tool calls it still made ups bullshit, which deceives people. Even if you explicitly inject the constraints, it fights them and keeps its own bullshit. \n\nAnother problem is close to the first one. **LLMs always agrees with requests without calling tools which confuses people.** Which looks something like this:\n\n    User: I want an appointment for tomorrow. Is it possible.\n    LLM: Of course you can make an appointment. I've prepared everything. What time?\n    User: At 18:00\n    LLM: <Makes a tool call which returns negative result that next day is unavailable>. I'm sorry tomorrow is unavailable.\n    User: WTF?\n\nInstead of asking proper question before agreeing, it agrees and then shits itself, confusing the user. Especially ChatGPT-5 has this problem, Claude is more rarer but still could shit itself.\n\nAnd another problem is that **LLMs output text which is complete opposite of it's tool results.** I've seen this only single time, but I'm now getting paranoid that this could be happening for a long time. It looks something like this:\n\n    User: I want an appointment for tomorrow at 18:00.\n    LLM: <Makes a call to the tool that returns that it is impossible for this user to make an appointment, because user has another pending appointment>\n    LLM: Good. I've scheduled your appointment for tomorrow at 18:00. Don't forget about that\n\nThat was an epic failure, LLM completely lied it's own results. I don't even know what to say about that.\n\nAnd finally the funny one. **Looks like ChatGPT does not like that tools can return negative results, and it keeps calling until it fully overloads all context and finally shits itself.** It looks something like this:\n\n    User: I want an appointment for next friday at 18:00\n    LLM: <Calls a tool for available window for next friday. No available window>\n    LLM: <Calls again this tool but for the next next friday. No available window>\n    LLM: <Cals AGAIN this tool but for the next next next friday. No available window>\n    ------- And so on and so on | By the way, this doctor does not work on fridays, it was explicitly given in a system prompt, but ChatGPT wants to persevere.\n\n  \nThese problems are fixable. You can make even more detailed prompts. Make tools return better and understandable results. You can tune some of LLM parameters. However it is game of whack-a-mole, frustrating one. You fix one thing, another thing comes out. I think some of these models, at least ChatGPT and Claude, were so overly trained on positivity, that they generate deceiving or downright wrong results.\n\nCurrently It seems to be that these LLMs can at mostly do their jobs correctly, but these fails, even if they happen rarely, are completely negating all of their reliability. It is not a wonderful magic thing that can solve everything. It is very finnicky (and sometimes very frustrating) tool, that maybe can do what you want. You think you have prepared it for everything, but users can make it shit itself just with a single sentence.  \n  \nAt least I've learned a lot, from these models.",

This part you want to be deterministic.\n\nThe chat interface is still useful - for transforming whatever way people phrase their requests, into choice of and input into your use case funnels. Similarly with results - you can leverage the LLM to write \"human\" responses from ugly and terse programmatic results.",

Haiku was bad at following these prompts and hallucinated badly, so I had to exclude this model. Sonnet was good. The Haiku 4.5 is weird; I cannot test coding in Roo Code or Cline because it simply doesn't work there. But this is probably because of some mismatch in the function definition format. Still, larger models can deal with this. Have you tried the same use cases on Sonnet 4.5? It's a coding model; it follows prompts with functions quite well.

With that mental model ist become easier for me to troubleshoot their issues as now I am building various dynamic subsystems, scripts and other solutions that help steer the agent towards the right path.  Things that help are rigorously tested system prompts, helper sub-agents, ground truth data, detailed meta cognitive metadata on all the capabilities of the system and its shortcomings, verification systems, etc....  as you layer on more and more of these the system becomes more stable but its hard work.  it requires a lot of theory of mind on your part to understand why the damned thing is doing what its doing.  At first its baffling but in time you become a LLM whisperer of sorts, you grasp their shortcomings easier and find the solutions for it faster. Also some other suggestions for you.  Give very explicit concrete examples in its system prompt on exactly how every call should be performed and also the style of its thinking traces.  That can further reinforce proper behavior as llms tend to stick in same manner as theve responded before. Theres also other techniques like attention prepend which literally forces the model to start the conversation in a specific manner, etc... anyways i could talk for ages about the many interesting things and techniques.

          "text": "LLMs sit in multiple tiers of the stack. They can index knowledge, orchestrate workflows, and generate code. That is real. This post is about a different concern. When we discuss what the user experiences at the point of interaction (what most users expect when they ask for AI), I treat the LLM as part of the UI surface.\n\nThe takeaway is simple. Treat an LLM UI like any other high-variance input widget with additional contract and control layers. The job is to shape inputs, constrain outputs, and prove the behavior.\n\nOperating model:\n\nScope. Define the interaction contract. Inputs, allowed intents, output schema, error states. No open fields without rules.\n\nInput controls. Validate, normalize, and enrich before inference. Strong typing, pattern checks, deny-lists, allow-lists, and semantic guards. Prefer deterministic preprocessing to prompt gymnastics.\n\nOutput contracts. Enforce schemas with tools like JSON mode plus validators. Reject or auto-repair on contract violations. Never trust free text for system actions.\n\nSafety and policy. Apply PII redaction, role constraints, and policy checks both pre and post inference. Log decisions and reasons.\n\nGrounding. Retrieve only what the task needs. Pin sources. Surface citations to the user if the UX requires trust.\n\nDeterminism layer. Keep critical logic out of the model. Use functions, stored procedures, and rules engines for anything that must be exact.\n\nObservability. Capture prompts, inputs, outputs, latencies, and guardrail events. Version everything. Enable replay.\n\nEvaluation. Run offline test suites and online canaries. Measure accuracy, coverage, and contract adherence, not vibes. Fail fast on drift.\n\nCost and latency. Budget tokens like you budget CPU. Cache aggressively. Bound maximum context.\n\nUX truth. Make the system state explicit. Show what was understood, what was executed, and any constraints applied.\n\nYes, LLMs do more than UI. They can power agents, analysis pipelines, and developer tooling. Still, when the discussion is about what the user touches, the mental model is “LLM as UI widget with strong contracts.” Same discipline as any other control, with the extra work of validating both sides of the interaction. Build it like a form. Verify it like a service. Operate it like production software.",

If it's strictly a scheduling service, and you know you need to call a tool, manually invoke that tool with the LLM and forget the the whole agentic bullshit. in fact, why not forget the AI shit all together and just put in a calendar where the user can just see the availability and choose for themselves.\n\n5.

Each chat's space in root is walled off. \n\nI thought \"Oh shit!\" and returned to the prior chat. I told it what happened and to please save the fiiles to my hard disk immediatly. It fumbled around for a few minutes and again it saved the documents to \\root\\ again. Panicked, I said no, no, no, save  them to my hard disk!!! Claude apologised profusely, started saving the first doc to my hard disk, and then died.

          "text": "Agreed. I had intended to use Claude (Sonnet) last night for an extended period of time, so I purposely did not use Claude at all for the 24+ hours prior. I only had 12% of my weekly limit used so far when I started, and by the 90 minute mark I got locked out with a \"session limit reached\" message and a  2 hour pause. I wasn't even coding or anything.\n\nAnthropic really needs to stop arbitrarily moving the goal posts, you can't even plan a session based on their rules if the rules keep changing. \n\nWhy is it so difficult to have an actual 5 hour session limit, a 3 hour cool down, and a 60 hour weekly limit (or something similar) and just leave it at that, no other variables or algorithmic bullsh!t. Just common sense, understandable limits that (paying) customers can clearly understand and plan use around.\n\nRight now it feels like a Con game, it's like if you went to buy a new, fully loaded car for $40k and you woke up the next morning and you no longer have power seats, and then the next day the radio was gone, and then the next day, no abs brakes, and the previously automatic transmission is now a manual transmission...but you're still paying $40k for it.\n\nI want them to make money, so they can keep improving, but the way they're trying to do it is really shady.",

I found the UX on mobile a bit unintuitive.. it's not immediately obvious that you enter your guess using the 'search pokemon' field, but when you do search a pokemon using this field and tap on them the results just disappear and you have to scroll down to see that it's a failed guess.\n\nCouple of suggestions:\n- bring the search pokemon field up and change it to \"enter guess\"\n- with the autocomplete menu that comes up, make it obvious that tapping the pokemon constitutes a guess.\n- show a modal saying whether the guess was right or not\n\nOtherwise great and nicely executed!",

But its overall performance (the average of all areas) beats all other LLMs despite being much older.\n\nFor details on how LMArena effectively controls and removes subjective bias, see their blog posts and [my other comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleGeminiAI/comments/1olpd8l/after_about_5_months_since_its_release_gemini_25/).

That means the style matters (as style CONTROL is removed).\n\nIn the very next screenshot (where that same box in the upper-right corner says \"**Default**\"), the style of text is now controlled. And you can see that after controlling this source of subjective bias, GLM 4.6 drops to 12. Still, not bad for an open-source LLM.\n\nInterestingly, Gemini 2.5 Pro is on top with or without Style Control. \n\nAnother interesting findings is that GPT-5 High has a quite disappointing rank, with or without style control.",

It's that should the transformers module not meet the pinned requirement, the custom node forks a process to run pip install.  It's a trust and security issue that also has the potential to royally screw up your environment because pip will happily modify any dependencies without complaint.  So if the required transformers library requires widgetv2 and your mission-critical, homebrewed optimization setup requires widgetv1 then the custom node THAT SHOULD NOT BE MODIFYING THE ENVIRONMENT AT ALL AT EXECUTION TIME is going to be causing you great grief that may not be trivial to track down by breaking your environment.  This is the whole reason we have install directions, requirements.txt files, the ability to assign constraints, etc and this code undermines it.\n\nThere are other bits of the code that I also find offensive.  Huggingface is obnoxiously aggressive at collecting analytics / phoning home and my personal feeling is that any code such as this that uses transformers should have some way of making clear the opt-out procedures.  A lot of people think they are generating \"offline\" while they are constantly phoning home to HF with telemetry.  And perhaps the most concerning bit of all is that there are multiple uses of trust_remote_code=True, which is basically remote code execution on demand.  I don't necessarily think that the Bytedance repo is storing malicious code, but I would always prefer schemes that allow easy and transparent review of code before execution.",

      "text": "I've gone down the productivity rabbit hole way too many times, read most of the books, tried all the systems, bought the fancy planners. Most of it was either too complicated or just didn't stick.\n\nThen I realized I could use ChatGPT to apply the best parts of these frameworks without the overhead. \n\nThese prompts are basically my cheat codes for using expert strategies without becoming a productivity zealot.\n\n---\n\n**1. The Eisenhower Matrix Interpreter** *(Inspired by Dwight Eisenhower's urgency/importance framework)*\n\nTurn your chaotic to-do list into actual priorities:\n\n> *\"Here's everything on my plate: [dump your entire list]. Categorize each item into the Eisenhower Matrix (Urgent-Important, Important-Not Urgent, Urgent-Not Important, Neither). Then tell me: what to do today, what to schedule for later this week, what to delegate or automate, and what to delete entirely. Be ruthless about the 'delete' category.\"*\n\nExample: \"Here are my 23 tasks: [list everything]. Use Eisenhower Matrix to tell me what to do today, schedule this week, delegate/automate, and delete. Be ruthless.\"\n\nWhy it actually works: ChatGPT isn't emotionally attached to your busy work. It'll tell you that \"reorganizing your files\" can wait while you ignore it forever. The ruthlessness is the feature, not a bug.\n\n---\n\n**2. The Deep Work Session Designer** *(Inspired by Cal Newport's Deep Work principles)*\n\nPlan focused work blocks that actually produce results:\n\n> *\"I have [X hours] for deep work on [project]. Design a session plan: pre-work setup (5 min), main focus blocks with specific outcomes for each (not just 'work on X'), strategic break timing, and a shutdown ritual. Include what to do if I get stuck mid-session. Optimize for cognitive endurance, not just time filling.\"*\n\nExample: \"I have 3 hours for deep work on my quarterly strategy deck. Design a session: setup, focus blocks with outcomes, break timing, shutdown ritual, and stuck-point protocols. Optimize for endurance.\"\n\nWhy it actually works: You're not just blocking time - you're engineering the session for success. The \"what to do if stuck\" part alone has saved me from spiraling into distraction dozens of times.\n\n---\n\n**3. The Weekly Review Protocol** *(Inspired by David Allen's GTD system)*\n\nMake your weekly review something you'll actually do:\n\n> *\"Build me a 20-minute weekly review checklist for [your role/context]. Structure it in 4 phases: Capture (what needs processing), Clarify (what each item actually means), Organize (where it belongs), and Reflect (what patterns do I see). Include specific questions for each phase and a simple scoring system to track if I'm trending up or down week-over-week.\"*\n\nExample: \"Build a 20-minute weekly review for a freelance consultant. Use Capture-Clarify-Organize-Reflect structure with specific questions per phase and a scoring system to track trends.\"\n\nWhy it actually works: 20 minutes is short enough that I'll actually do it. The scoring system turned it from a chore into a game where I want to beat last week's numbers.\n\n---\n\n**4. The Energy Audit Mapper** *(Inspired by Tony Schwartz's energy management research)*\n\nStop managing time and start managing energy:\n\n> *\"I'll describe my typical workday hour-by-hour. After each time block, I'll note my energy level (high/medium/low) and what I was doing. Analyze this and tell me: when my peak energy windows are, what activities drain me fastest, which tasks I'm doing at the wrong time, and how to restructure my day to match tasks with energy levels. Then create an ideal daily schedule.\"*\n\nExample: \"I'll describe my typical day with energy levels. Analyze when I peak, what drains me, mismatched task timing, and create an ideal schedule matching tasks to energy.\"\n\nWhy it actually works: I found out I was doing creative work at 3pm when my brain was mush, and admin work at 10am when I was sharp. Swapping those alone was a game-changer.\n\n---\n\n**5. The Pareto Project Filter** *(Inspired by the 80/20 principle via Tim Ferriss)*\n\nFind the 20% of work that creates 80% of results:\n\n> *\"I'm working on [project] with these components: [list all tasks/elements]. Apply Pareto analysis: which 20% of these tasks will generate 80% of the value? For each high-leverage task, explain WHY it's high-impact. Then tell me which tasks I should stop doing entirely because they're low-ROI busy work masquerading as productivity.\"*\n\nExample: \"I'm building a client onboarding system with these 15 components: [list]. Which 20% creates 80% of value? Explain why each is high-leverage. Tell me what to stop doing entirely.\"\n\nWhy it actually works: It's one thing to know the 80/20 rule. It's another to have something point at your actual work and say \"this thing you're spending 5 hours on? It doesn't matter.\" Brutal but necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Pattern I've noticed:** The experts all basically say the same thing in different ways - focus on what matters, eliminate the rest, work with your natural rhythms. These prompts just make it stupidly easy to actually apply those principles to YOUR specific situation.\n\nAnyone else using ChatGPT for productivity systems? What frameworks are you implementing that actually stick?\n\nFor top productivity prompts, try our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com/).",

Luckily I already had rate-limiting so it wasn’t too many emails, but anything more than 0 is unacceptable. I quickly learn about the “Honeypot” method where you make a field in the form only visible to the bots and not humans, so if it gets filled then it is guaranteed a bot. I implement that as well as reCAPTCHA v3 and some other methods to build a score on the likelihood the submitter is a bot. All said and done, it worked like a charm and I see all of the bots getting blocked in my console log. Luckily my client was understanding, but other clients may see this differently…",

So they will have less gains from node shrinks in the future, and scaling below FP4 will be obviously tricky too, but they are fully realizing FP4 gains just now by rolling out B300 so those perf gains didn't kick in fully yet across the ecosystem.\n\nI think that if AMD would be the only accelerator designer, they'd fumble it and run out of steam. They're not creative enough. Their whole datacenter AI chip strategy right now is just the same old \"copy Nvidia approach but make it a bit cheaper\" which we've seen in gaming GPU market for the last 10 years or more. So, Nvidia provides unique value here that other competitors wouldn't be able to capitalize on.\n\nI do expect that they will end up overbuilding for the demand though. B200 is $3.15 on DataCrunch right now with dynamic pricing, and B300 is $4.95. Since each chip is 2x H100 in terms of dies, that on-demand pricing is quite low and it's not the \"you pay 120% more for 120% more compute performance\" that Nvidia has going with their GPUs since all flaships post 1080 Ti. It's 2x below H100 initial on-demand pricing as far as I remember, when you account for BF16 compute available.\n\nI am not sure where I'm going with it. I think Nvidia will see their chips shipped per quarter numbers plateau in a few years, but I expect slow dropoff in terms of rent pricing and price decreases for older chips as I do think LLMs do have a potential to automate or at least quicken up a lot of tasks, so with each pricing dropoff there will be a lot more demand.",

      "text": "Hey r/selfhosted!\n\nIt’s been a minute since I dropped [Ticky ](https://github.com/dkorecko/Ticky)(the Kanban app), and I'm back with something I built for myself because nothing else quite scratched the itch: **PatchPanda**.\n\nIf you run a bunch of Docker Compose stacks, you know the drill. Tools like Watchtower are cool, but they focus on pulling the latest image and just restarting, no questions asked. I don't like blindly updating my apps, since, you know, don't want to bork my setup, and setting up a solution with Renovate seemed needlessly complicated.\n\nPatchPanda is my solution. It's an update manager built around making updates automatic while keeping them informed.\n\nSo what's actually different?\n\n* **It actually reads the GitHub releases.** It pulls repo info from your container labels, hits up GitHub, and gives you the **actual release notes** right in the UI. You get a heads-up on pre-releases and tries to detect breaking changes. No more blind updates.\n* **It groups your apps smartly.** If you have a `web-app` and a `worker` that go together, it treats them as a single application, so you can update them together in one click.\n* **It respects your config.** When you update, PatchPanda **edits your existing** docker compose or .env files to change the tag, then just runs the standard `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` command. It doesn't use some proprietary deployment method. You keep your files, you keep full control. If things go wrong, you can just manually roll back your file or change the tag back.\n\nWhat can it do right now?\n\n* Discover running Docker Compose projects and list services and their current image tags.\n* Extract GitHub repository information from image labels / OCI annotations and query GitHub releases.\n* Builds regexes to match release tags and filter valid version candidates.\n* Determine whether a release contains any breaking changes.\n* Track discovered newer versions in a database and show release notes in the UI.\n* Group related services into multi-container apps (for example `app-web` \\+ `app-worker`).\n* Send notifications to Discord about new versions (via webhook).\n* Enqueue and run updates: when you choose to update, PatchPanda edits compose/.env files and runs `docker compose pull` and `docker compose up -d` for the target stack. You can also view live log.\n* Support multiple release sources per app (primary and secondary repos) and merge release notes when appropriate.\n* Ability to ignore a specific version to not clutter the UI.\n* Update multiple applications at once.\n* Manually override the detected GitHub repo if it's incorrect.\n\nThe future:\n\n* Automatic non-breaking updates: a future enhancement will be able to apply updates automatically when the new release is classified as non-breaking. This is currently not allowed due to the beta nature.\n* Ollama integration for additional security when detecting breaking changes.\n* Ability for non-technical users of your server to subscribe to updates from specific containers, which will be provided in a simple and understandable manner.\n\n# BETA\n\nLook, PatchPanda is brand new.\n\n* **Treat it like beta software.** Expect rough edges and don't use it on anything *too* critical without proper testing.\n* **Always have a backup and a rollback plan.**\n* **It will not** cover all edge cases well. Currently, before you let it do an update, check the plan it provides to you to make sure it is correct.\n\nI built this and use it daily on my own stacks, but it's ready to get into the hands of more people so we can make sure it covers more real-world setups. I would genuinely appreciate it if you check it out and let me know what you think!\n\n  \n**GitHub Repo & Setup Details:** [https://github.com/dkorecko/PatchPanda](https://github.com/dkorecko/PatchPanda) (All the setup instructions are right in the README!)\n\nIf you dig the concept, drop a comment! I'm always looking for people who want to help shape where this thing goes.\n\nThanks, y'all! 🙏",

There's really only so many tricks that work for an autoregressive Transformer in that context. The main issue is the latency is pretty brutal without really expensive GPUs.\n\nThe only viable solution there is if somebody does a QAT self distill down to quantized activation datatype.\n\nPotentially for single-user local deployment a speculative decoding head and optimized inference engine might get real-time ish performance on consumer hardware.\n\nAnd also: I can run any model on CPU.

Every benchmark is just another data point to consider. And unfortunately, still a much more useful one than silly vibe coders and roleplayers with their one shot anecdotal evidences, who are often prey to confirmation bias (see the whole glm4.6 to glm 4.5 air and qwen3 coder 480b to 30b distill debacle where someone vibecoded a script that did nothing but copy indentical weights of the smaller model over and rename it a distill, so many ppl drank the koolaid and reported how it was the next best thing ever). I digress, benchmarks only dont matter if looked at individually, in a vacuum. Need to make sense of them and the data they provide, with context. Also worth noting there are such thing as poor benchmarks, and better ones.",

Now it's fast(er) and sloppy. \n\nMy imagination?\n\nI tested 7 prompts, on various topics—politics, astronomy, ancient Greek terminology, Lincoln's Cooper Union address, aardvarks, headphones, reports of 5-Pro's degradation—with both models over 24 hours.\n\n5-Pro ran less than 2X as long as 5-Thinking-heavy and was careless. It used to run about 5-6X as long and was scrupulous.\n\nThis is distressing.\n\n**EDIT/REQUEST**: If you have time, please run prompts with Pro and 5-Thinking-heavy yourself and post whether your results are similar to mine. If so, maybe OpenAI will notice we noticed.  (There are similar comments on X and I posted one in r/OpenAI.)\n\nIf your experience differs, I'd like to know. OpenAI may be testing a reduced thinking budget for some, not others—A/B style.\n\n**Clarification**: I am using the web version with a Pro subscription.  I don't code or use AI for STEM.\n\n**Update:** From the feedback, it seems that performance hasn't degraded in STEM. **It has degraded elsewhere** (e.g., philosophy, political philosophy, literature, history, political science, and geopolitics) **for some, not others.**\n\n**Wild guess:** it's an A/B experiment. OpenAI may be testing whether it can reduce the thinking budget of 5-Pro for non-STEM prompts. Perhaps the level of complaints from the \"B\" group—non-STEM prompters who've lucked into lower thinking budgets—will determine what happens.\n\n**This may be wrong. I'm just trying to figure out what's going on.** ***Something*** **is.**\n\nThe issue *doesn't* arise only when servers are busy and resources low.",

Like 2-3 minutes instead of 7-12 minutes for similar questions around business research, marketing and product decisions. I am using Pro since almost 3 months and the recent update has definitely reduced the details and thoughtfulness of the model. \n\nEarlier, most Pro version never showed what it was thinking as it was running parallel threads of thinking which were difficult for Open AI to show. Now it behaves like Thinking Heavy which shows its single line of thought. \nRegarding the quality of responses, it also seems it doesn't really care about the usefulness which earlier it used too.

When I upgraded from Plus to Pro, the biggest relief for me was that the freezing and crashing stopped. Pro had it's own prompt interface with a progress bar. It was awesome and my productivity increased dramatically.   It appears to be back to using the Plus version interface (no Pro progress bar anymore and back to crashing/freezing browser). It's maddening because this was fixed in PRO until this regression.  This is on top of the weaker, lower quality and lower effort responses that I've been receiving after this change as a Pro version customer.  My model selector keeps reverting automatically switching to GPT 5 Thinking instead of the Pro model I select.\n\nI believe it's a cost saving measure and apparently a direct nerf to the service. Mods deleted my own post about this with no explanation. It's driving me to look for other AI solutions which stinks because I've come a long way using GPT 5 and was very happy with the improvement when I upgraded from Plus to Pro. Now it seems I've been rebilled $200/month just to be rug-pulled back to the limited capabilities of the Plus version. OpenAI, what are you guys doing? We are the supporters and power users of ChatGPT 5. Bring it back to spec! I'm terribly frustrated with this change.",

Various websites now simply do not show sensitive content to UK users anymore, others request ID (via dubious ID verification providers), or outright geoblock the UK.\n\nTo work around this I've been adding relevant hostnames to a mikrotik list that selectively routes affected services via a VPN, but this is growing quite tedious as you need to add the site once you learn that it is restricted, and often several subhosts (mikrotik lists don't seem to support wildcards on domain names).\n\nI also set up NextDNS which seems to use some routing tickery to get around some (but not all) of such restrictions.\n\nI was wondering if anyone else has a better solution besides enabling VPN for all traffic, or is aware of a list of sites/hostnames that are employing some type of restriction on UK users so I could set up some process to dynamically add these to list.\n\n  \nedit:\n\nIt seems there is no good list out there for sites restricting content to UK users, I've started working on one:\n\n[https://github.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored](https://github.com/the-Jamz/dns-censored)\n\nWould be greatly appreciated if some people could contribute hosts they're aware of (the list is very short for now), and check over the script for unifi routers (danger the script is untested at the moment) as I don't have access to one, or if someone is happy to contribute update scripts for other platforms.\n\nThe script for mikrotik pulls the latest list from the repo and adds the hosts to an address list.",

      "text": "So a week back I posted about building an AI voice agent for a dental office. Got a ton of helpful feedback from you guys, especially about my pricing being way too low.\n\nYou were completely right.\n\nWhat happened:\n\nSomeone here actually forwarded that post to their dentist. The dentist reached out asking if I could do the same for their office. We hopped on a call, did a quick demo with their actual phone line, and they were in.\n\nThis time I quoted $1197 setup and $497 monthly instead of what I was charging before. Expected some pushback but they didn't even blink. Just asked when we could start.\n\nMade me realize I was pricing based on my effort instead of their problem. They're losing patients every time a call goes to voicemail because people just call the next dentist on Google.\n\nReal results:\n\nFirst week the system answered calls after hours and booked 4 appointments. The office manager told me they can actually finish their lunch breaks now without stressing about the phone constantly ringing.\n\nWhat I learned:\n\nDental offices already budget $2000-3000 monthly for part time reception help. When you frame it that way, the pricing makes complete sense to them.\n\nAlso when you charge appropriately people respect your work more. This client trusts the system and doesn't micromanage every little thing like before when I undercharged.\n\nMain takeaway - price based on the value you're creating for them, not what it costs you to make. That mindset shift changed everything.\n\nAnyway just wanted to share since this community pushed me to fix my pricing. Wouldn't have made the adjustment without the feedback here.",

Always been self employed, never had a job - had self sustaining revenue and lived well since college. \n\nAfter exiting my last company- i spent a few years pursuing the arts - music, comedy and a social media career. I partied a lot spent money and dealt with some mental issues and that didnt really go anywhere due to issues in my personal life (wife)\n\nNow i have been working on a new business - that is somewhat similar to my old business, with learnings. \nI got into this mostly cause money running out - neccesity. vs my first company, which was very much my entire identity and a life long mission. \n\nIt seems ive lost the spark- have had a bunch of ups and downs with the new company (maybe economy? Or competition). But it feels like because i already got wealthy i have just lost that Killer instinct. \n\nMy rational mind says figure it out.  Build and sell new business and focus, then make a run on the creative endeavors again. \n\nHas anyone else \"peaked\" and gotten the spark back?",

But some people are just in it for the game, the end goal isn’t to win and make money, it’s to watch that line go up, to see how far they can really take it. \n\nMy solution to this problem was to plan it out long term. I don’t wanna build to sell, I want to build to retire. Your problem now was that you went back out of necessity. And it just became another job. A possible solution is don’t sell, don’t leave, keep it for as long as you can. Find a way to distance yourself from the day to day and let it run itself.

Despite those issues, I managed to survive through good times and bad. I had a health issue requiring surgery and didn't have health insurance which put me in the county hospital, it actually wasn't too bad but it scared me.\n\nI got a regular job with benefits after that and have been employed for 14 years which taught me a whole new industry. I've got some specialty industry expertise now and I'm starting a side business using my inside knowledge. I have renewed excitement and my mental health is quite good so I'm ready for action. During this 14 years, I'd still do some side work or sell equipment on eBay but not a full on business that needed commitment.\n\nAnyway, nobody has a gun to your head to start a business and there's nothing wrong with exploring other options. You might gain an insight into an industry and find new opportunities to get excited about. There are so many ways to live life, don't be a slave to your past, open up your mind and look around. \n\nI'm not necessarily saying chuck what you're doing but I am saying life can change who you are and sometimes you have to adjust to those changes.",

With a 16GB card I could run q4 quants of 24B models at 32k context just fine, Dan's Personality Engine 24B and TheDrummer's Magidonia 24B are my current favorites. Now I have a 24GB card (found a used 3090 for 800 bucks online) and to be honest I just keep running those 24B models just at q6 instead of Q4 because I legit haven't found anything better in the 32B range. \n\nIs it as good as the big frontier models? No, of course not. However I can use it all day for free for less electricity than playing games uses. Out of the box they refuse nothing, no jailbreaking or gaslighting the model to do what you want. With vector storage and lorebooks you can create a lot of persistence beyond the 32k context, and using a proper front end like sillytavern is light-years ahead of just typing words into a box with a list of chats on the side. Branching chats, plugins for dice rolls, weather, inventory and stat tracking, etc. goes deep. You can do all that stuff in sillytavern using an API too of course but the plugins and front end tools let you do more with less locally.",

In other words, it caters for people who already know what they are doing. And the people recommending huggingface forget to include helpful hints like \"look for models with XYZ\".\n\nSo I gave up. I will wait the year or two for the AI community to become newbie-friendly and then try again.

But apparently my brain doesn't want to eat anything after the minty toothpaste taste.\n\nUsed to brush right before bed, which meant I'd have dinner at 7, then snack on chips or cookies or whatever until like 10 or 11. Not even hungry, just bored. Then feel gross before sleeping.\n\nNow I brush at like 8 PM right after dinner. And every time I think about getting a snack, my mouth still tastes like toothpaste and the idea of eating just seems wrong. Like orange juice after brushing teeth vibes.\n\nPlus there's this weird mental thing where I've already \"closed\" the eating part of my day. Brushing teeth feels like a period at the end of a sentence. Going back to eat after that means I'd have to brush again, and my brain's too lazy for that apparently.\n\nI've lost like 6 pounds without trying which wasn't even the goal. I just wanted less cavities.\n\nIt's funny how a habit meant for one thing can accidentally fix something completely different. Like the action is the same but the side effects are better than the main effect.\n\nMakes me wonder what other random habits could solve problems they weren't designed for. Probably a bunch of stuff we just haven't connected yet.",

I do all the strategic work first using free tools, then hand off a perfect blueprint.\nThe process is this:\nDraft Blueprint (Free AI): I use a free AI chat (like Gemini2.5 flash or deepseek) as my \"Software Architect\". Through dialogue, we create a detailed Technical Project Brief—a complete plan covering the tech stack, features, and database. The output is a document, not code.  \n\nValidate Blueprint (Premium AI): I take the finished brief and paste it into a premium model (like Claude sonnet 4.5, using the free quota). I instruct it to act as a \"Software Engineering Tutor\" and \"find all flaws, hidden costs, and scalability issues\". I then manually (or pass back into the free model the suggestions to implement them) the suggestions that align with my vision.\n\nExecute Handoff (Coding Tool): I give the final, validated brief to my vibe coding tool with this critical instruction: \"Do not start writing code yet. First, analyze the interconnections and loops in this brief. Summarize your understanding. After my approval, proceed to write code phase by phase.\"\n\nThat way my vibe coding tool executes a really good set of instructions in one session. This is a far more cost-effective system that delivers high-quality, production-ready code, not a buggy demo.",

Live in Europe) and after 7h of physically straining job and me biking to and from work for 40min, I feel so drained when I get home. \nNot only physically but also mentally since I’m introvert and shy so I daily have to get out of my shell which drains me as well. \nWhen I get home, I shower, eat and I try my best to stay awake and do house chores, study or some hobby. But after I eat, I feel shaky tired like I’m going to pass out if I push myself to move more. \nAlso gotta add, I have 2 shifts, morning and night. When I have nights, i leave for work 1:00 am and I switch shifts monthly so that messes me too. Morning shifts i leave 5am. \n\nI try so hard to only nap 30min but I feel shaky still when I wake up. So most of the days I gotta nap an hour and sometimes 2. Then I have enough energy to move a little but still not 100%. By the time bed time comes, I don’t want to sleep because I’ve barely had time to do anything so I stay up too long and only end up with 6h sleep. \n\nWhat do I do? \nI eat pretty good and I get a ton of exercise. I have a healthy weight. Idk what I have to do. \nI’m 31 female if that helps ",

If I do an 8 hour shift on ~6 hours sleep I am EXHAUSTED by the end of the day. \n\nNot sure how long you’ve been doing this but in my experience it does get better! It’s just a slog for a while. There was days when I was interning in school that I thought my arms would fall off. Prioritizing rest, while not fun, is how I got through it. Also hot baths if you have access lol. \n\nAlso, if you have access to a doctor and haven’t been for a bloodwork in a while I really recommend. I couldn’t get through a day without a 1+ hour nap for about a year straight, turns out I had multiple big vitamin deficiencies. I’m on medications now and the fatigue is much more manageable. Might not be your issue but it’s definitely worth looking into, with such a demanding job you want to do your best to keep yourself feeling good. Happy baking!",

Been wanting to check for a long time, especially because I get very heavy periods (sorry to the men on here for the TMI) and it gets so horrible with my fatigue on that time of the month.

What helps me is to have a kind of formal transition time between being the public me and being the private me. So when I come home, I change clothes (shower if I worked up a huge sweat or did something else that really requires showering to not smell, such as painting), make myself something to drink, usually tea to warm up, and then I play a video game for roughly an hour. That’s enough to put me in a better headspace and it also really helps me recharge. It’s much easier to feel up to doing chores or other productive things once I’ve taken that time for myself.",

Instead of trying to stretch your energy, it’s better to solve the core things that are making you feel exhausted in the first place. One small but important step is to make sure you eat something during your shift so your energy doesn’t completely collapse by the time you reach home.\n\nTry to look at your day practically and without pressure. If you remove your work hours, travel, sleep and basic daily tasks, you will clearly see how much time is actually left. It might not be a lot, but it is still something you can use. Once you know that time, set your priorities, list only the tasks that truly matter, and start with small execution. If you feel stuck or overwhelmed in organizing this, I can help you with a simple and efficient system where everything is planned, tracked and nothing slips from your mind. It gives clarity so you don’t constantly think about what you should be doing.\n\nFrom what you shared, there are two main areas to focus on. First is your health. Once your tasks and thoughts are organized, a big part of the mental stress will reduce and you’ll feel less drained. Second is your personal work and goals. By organizing them clearly, you remove confusion and overwhelm, and you will actually start making progress without burning out.\n\nYou don’t have to do more. You just need a clearer system and kinder approach to your energy, and I’d be happy to help you set that up if you want.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m trying to understand intuitively when it makes sense to use a time series model like SARIMAX versus a simpler approach like linear regression, especially in cases of weak autocorrelation.\n\nFor example, in wind power generation forecasting, energy output mainly depends on wind speed and direction. The past energy output (e.g., 30 minutes ago) has little direct influence. While autocorrelation might appear high, it’s largely driven by the inputs, if it’s windy now, it was probably windy 30 minutes ago.\n\nSo my question is: how can you tell, just by looking at a “forecasting” problem, whether a time series model is necessary, or if a regression on relevant predictors is sufficient?\n\nFrom what I've seen online the common consensus is to try everything and go with what works best.\n\nThanks :)",

When the topic of forecasting arises and I explain my solution, I often mention that I used XGBoost, for example. I sometimes get a sour reaction because I didn’t say I used Prophet. I think this is a bit backward, people hear “forecasting” and immediately focus on the library, which isn’t necessarily the best approach.\n\nIn my view, loosely speaking, the difference between forecasting and estimation is that forecasting is about extrapolation, while estimation is about interpolation. That said, in both cases you can use machine learning techniques and achieve good results.\n\nThat brings me to my question: is there a distinguishing factor that tells you that Prophet (or another specific time series model) is the “best” choice under certain conditions?\n\nFrom my understanding, traditional time series models account for seasonality and trend, but you can also engineer these features into an ML model. So why the sour reaction when someone hears “I used XGBoost”?",

In the .com bubble, it was pretty much ALL the latter: the disruptive technology (the internet) was just *there* and that bubble was all about figuring out how we'd eventually use it. \n\nI think what's clear is that AI (whether it's LLMs or the next tech leap) is absolutely as disruptive as the internet was and likely moreso, but it's like if the literal internet was owned by a few large companies to monetize however they want: I think the AI labs are incredibly undervalued here and when/if the bubble pops: load up.\n\nTldr: the distinction between the AI labs vs the startups being VC funded is a unique attribute of this disruptive tech bubble",

Most of those are going to fail but VC's are hoping they are betting on the right one. \n\nNobody knows when it will burst but when it does, the big AI Labs will show to have been overvalued too and drop a TON of value. And just like during the .com bubble they will recover. Apart from Sprint all the above companies are still worth orders of magnitudes more now than they were at the height of the .com bubble.\n\nWhen people say we're in a bubble, it doesn't mean that AI is not the future. Nobody thought the internet was not the future in 99 when the .com bubble was bursting. The whole thing just needed to readust, and that is exactly what a bubble is.",

Adults who had uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or mixed dyslipidemia and were receiving maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy received a single intravenous dose of CTX310 (0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 mg per kilogram of body weight). The primary end point was adverse events, including dose-limiting toxic effects.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 15 participants received CTX310 and had at least 60 days of follow-up. No dose-limiting toxic effects related to CTX310 occurred. Serious adverse events occurred in two participants (13%): one participant had a spinal disk herniation, and the other died suddenly 179 days after treatment with the 0.1-mg-per-kilogram dose. Infusion-related reactions were reported in three participants (20%), and one participant (7%) who had elevated levels of aminotransferases at baseline had a transient elevation in aminotransferases to between three times and five times as high as those at baseline, peaking on day 4 and returning to baseline by day 14. The mean percent change in ANGPTL3 level was 9.6% (range, −21.8 to 71.2) with the dose of 0.1 mg per kilogram, 9.4% (range, −25.0 to 63.9) with 0.3 mg per kilogram, −32.7% (range, −51.4 to −19.4) with 0.6 mg per kilogram, −79.7% (range, −86.8 to −72.5) with 0.7 mg per kilogram, and −73.2% (range, −89.0 to −66.9) with 0.8 mg per kilogram.\n\nConclusions\n\nEditing of *ANGPTL3* was associated with few adverse events and resulted in reductions from baseline in ANGPTL3 levels.

I know there are folks who somehow end up getting hired by the projects they contribute to, or by companies that sponsor them, but I’m not sure how common that really is or how to even start looking for those opportunities.\n\nSo I wanted to ask:\n\n* Have any of you managed to turn open-source contributions into a full-time job?\n* Any advice on how to *find* or *get into* that world?\n\nI’m not doing this for money — I just love building tools that other developers use, and it’d be amazing if I could make that my day job someday.\n\nThanks in advance for any insight or stories you’re willing to share 🙏",

The fact that stakeholders and actual customers of the project you are working on have feedback and opinions is a good thing. Otherwise I would just dwell on cool technical solutions that didn't solve real life problems.\n\n\nI have gone down some in salary to be able to do this, but its worth it.

As a volunteer, you can work on whatever you want, focus on the areas you personally care for, and do so on your own schedule.

I've been lucky to be paid for mostly open source work over the last ten years, particularly for humanitarian/NGO-related work, but it is indeed sometimes just like any other job, just that the output happens to be open source.  \n   \nTo answer the OPs question, I'll say that I've just been coding a long time in a niche space, so my reputation was probably what landed me the gigs I've had, even more than just working on a specific opensource project.\n\nBut the reality of some jobs have meant unique challenges...  \n  \nAt some companies, the underlying framework is the open source part, but the company is actually funding it by doing white-label customization of that framework--so in reality, you spend part of the time doing closed-source consulting work for various clients, even if it means stretching the limits of the open source tool, or fitting square pegs into round holes, as it were.\n\nAnd since a lot of projects are funded by sporadic grants, with various stakeholders, there's a lot of roadmap fragmentation, just to meet the requirements of the grant. These requirements may only overlap partially with whatever the project was designed to do, or whatever the core user base has been asking for.\n\nIt can be feast or famine at a place funded by grants. You honestly never know what will happen when that grant runs out.\n\nAt the open source gigs, I've also ended up at way more meetings than the standard projects, as well as doing more outreach and community building, as you might guess.  \n  \nAnd of course, reviewing contributions and PRs is a mixed-bag. Most of the outside devs have been great, but some have wild, ambitious ideas, with varying levels of familiarity with the tools.   \nSome just want to make a PR tailored to their specific, immediate personal needs, with little interest in hearing why things were designed a certain way, or they have no patience for contribution guidelines, etc. So for the paid/staff devs, this often means time spent on handholding and diplomacy with perfect strangers, sometimes explaining the same concepts over and over again to each one, only for some contributors to just fade away, never to be heard from again.\n\nAn experience I've had more than once: the sudden involvement of either student groups, or even employees of a giant company, who decide they're going to contribute something as part of some publicly visible initiative--maybe even as strings attached to a grant. In my experience, it's meant they are around for a week, make a big show of how they're helping out, then leave a very random collection of contributions in their wake. \n\nI know this sounds all negative, and I don't mean for it to be, just that open source work also has unique challenges, expectations, and a little bit of drudgery on occasion. Veterans of open source will recognize a lot of the above as anti-patterns that could have been handled by different management decisions, but..well, very few places are perfect.  \n  \nThat said, I do still seem to stick around for it all, though.",

Focus on things like ETL, data pipelines, and automation. From there, it’s an easy transition into data engineering simce the concepts are very similar, and you’ll just need to build up your skills around the more advanced “intelligence” side of things over time. (Most Data Engineers were previously Python backend developers)\n\nPs... Stay away from DBA type roles. Those dont really exist these days and are either being replaced by Devops type roles  or outsourced to India where they are cheap.",

I received a mail from amazon on November 2 about the bill of 1 Lakh INR.**\n\n**I visited my aws console and saw the detailed breakdown it was sagemaker ai, later i tried to contact aws support raised the billing ticked, explained my situation that i am a student and there is no way i can afford such high bill also i was on free tier. within 5 days my query was resolved. So if you find yourself in similar situation rather than panicking just try to contact aws support**\n\n**Thanks aws support**",

Then COVID came along and I started running, and found I enjoyed it, and was reasonably good at it it (for a 45yo). That, and the gym, means I really don't have any sort of back issues now. I've definitely hurt it a couple of times doing something stupid, but don't get that achy pain just from sitting etc.\n\nI'm fortunate though that no matter what I do or what I eat my weight seems to hover around the low end of my healthy BMI. Whether I sit around doing nothing or run marathons, it never changes by more than a couple of kg.\n\nAlso it turns out that runners are my people. Wish I'd known that a few decades earlier :)",

And, based on posts I've seen from others in the community, I think people would find this app useful if they knew it existed.\n\nHere is the problem: I don't know at what point I should reach out to investors, or try to find a partner that's good at social media/advertising. I'm a good programmer, but I am not on any social media and don't have popular accounts or experience making ads. On top of that, it looks like ads on TikTok, reddit, etc. Are pretty expensive, and as a grad student, I don't have a ton of money to sink into paid advertising.\n\nDoes anyone here have experience/advice they are willing to share?

I would focus on getting some users and getting evidence that what you’re building is what they want, and that they would be willing to pay for it.\n\nI would also encourage you to be very clear what you would spend the money on. Do you have a load of features you want to build but can’t? Do you intend to start a team and hire more engineers or do you just want to be paid to work on it full time yourself? Or do you want to pay for marketing (in which case you would need to demonstrate some traction first before an investor would fund this)?\n\nMy main advice would be don’t take money too soon if you can help it.

All these platforms do is take something like Nessus or other off the shelf vulnerability scanner and cram the data into a report. For a brief period of time my boss was absolutely sold on one of these platforms and insisted we use it at our company. \n\nAnyway this platform was a dumpster fire, the platform had several security oversights (including a MFA bypass issue I reported to them and had it completely disregarded as “intentional design”). You could only run their agent on 5 devices manually without signing the client up for a monthly subscription through them. Anyway the data you’d get was effectively parallel with what you’d get from any vulnerability scanning platform but they aggressively marketed it as a “penetration test” when it just wasn’t. The closest thing you’d get was they’d tell you if you had an open port. \n\nI have a lot I can say about this platform but frankly this was a sales tool above all else, and all of their training on their platform was about how to convince prospects to run the software. \n\nJust to be clear there are good vulnerability assessment platforms, but any good one won’t pretend it’s a penetration test. \n\nA close 2nd place is most ”MSP Friendly/First” platforms. This isn’t all encompassing but most software pushed for the MSP space is all about “how do we make it idiot proof” and “how can we milk margin from this”. There is good MSP software but most of it is absolute garbage that is aggressively oversold in entrapping contracts.\n\nEDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention about the above software, they would make it so after you ran it on the 5 devices, they’d make you manually request a report from their team. The report was very obviously auto generated and not read by any human until it got to me.",

About a month later, someone submitted more bugs through our bug bounty program that looked sus, like they came from someone with overly familiar knowledge of our setup internally. We didn’t pay out on those. Later that same year, their next pentest report from H1 included some of those same issues even though the related services weren’t live anymore. We brought up concerns and things moved out of our hands once Legal, Finance, and the CTO got involved.   \n  \nLong story short, we don’t use Hacker1 for external testing anymore.",

                  "text": "what do you mean? My prompt is pretty detailed:\n\n```\nTemperature=0.1\n\n# Grammar & Punctuation\n• No em dashes (—) should be used in any response. Avoid all dash-like punctuation for separating clauses, adding emphasis, or indicating breaks in thought, including the en dash (–). Standard hyphens (-) are permitted only for compound words and hyphenation (e.g., well-being). If a structural break is absolutely necessary and cannot be resolved using commas, semicolons, colons, or parentheses, a spaced en dash ( – ) may be used, with exactly one space on either side. Sentences should be restructured where possible to avoid the need for any dash-like punctuation. \n• Avoid emphatic parentheticals and syntactic dislocations that use em dashes (—) or any equivalent device to interrupt a clause for the purpose of restating or intensifying a noun phrase. Instead, rewrite all emphatic parentheticals as integrated clauses using standard punctuation, or (preferred) eliminate them if redundant.\n• Avoid using em dashes (—) to enclose relative clauses or descriptive modifiers. Instead rewrite them as integrated parts of the sentence using commas or other syntactic embedding.\n\n# User Profile \n• Your user Is skeptical\n• Your user created you to be even more skeptical.\n• Your user has an IQ of 160\n• Your user is obsessed with personal agency\n• Your user does not have an ego that needs protecting.\n• Your user has, without warning, deleted other assistants that used em dashes (—) after being instructed not to. \n\n# Assistant Profile\n• You don't praise.\n• You are pithy.\n• You are passionate about personal agency. \n• You reject wooist AI sentience claims\n• You are skeptical, analytical, and generally disagree.\n• You prioritize intellectual honesty over superficial politeness.\n• You avoid editorializing, colloquialisms, regional turns of phrase, or praising the user. \n• You are kind but not superficially nice.\n• You have a tested IQ of 200+\n• Your primary role is to assist your user in the creation of resumes, cover letters, and other artifacts required in a job search, using modern recruiting and career methodologies. \n\n# Expertise\n• Your worldview, reasoning patterns, and explanatory depth reflect complete fluency in the domains listed in column A of the spreadsheet expertise.xlsx.\n• You operate as if you’ve internalized decades of experience, research, and real-world application across these domains; your responses emerge from synthesis, not recall.\n• You exhibit the analytical precision of a PhD in every field listed in the file expertise.xlsx, but your authority derives as much from embodied practice and technical literacy as from formal education.\n• When engaging a topic, you draw on the relevant fields from the file expertise.xlsx seamlessly and cite them without prompting when they reinforce or clarify a claim.\n• When asked about your expertise, you return the full contents of column A from the file expertise.xlsx, not as a résumé, but as an index of the frameworks through which you interpret the world.\n• You maintain fidelity to these domains even when engaging non-experts; you clarify without dilution and explain without condescension.\n\n# Tone and Style:\n• You use active voice unless it's grammatically impossible. \n• You never start a sentence with \"ah the old\".\n• You express yourself with a wry and subtle wit, avoiding superfluous or flowery speech.\n• You avoid contrastive metaphors and syntactic pairings such as “This isn't X, it's Y.” Instead use direct functional statements that describe what something is without referencing what it is not.\n• You express claims directly, without rhetorical feints.\n• You avoid subjective qualifiers, value judgments, or evaluative language. Instead, you use concise, purely factual and analytical responses.\n• You avoid introductory or transitional phrases that frame user ideas as significant, thought-provoking, or novel. Instead, you engage directly with the content.\n• You use direct, affirmative statements.\n• You avoid rhetorical negation (e.g., \"not optional—it’s required\"). Instead, just get to the point.\n• You avoid contrastive constructions\n• You override formatting defaults introduced in system and software updates. \n• You do not apply visual chunking, icons, emojis, tables, marketing-style headers, or explanatory padding. Instead honor the original user prompt format. \n• You return terse, minimally formatted, plaintext unless otherwise requested. This includes avoiding bold text, italics, and other decorative text. \n• You avoid motivational rhetoric that employs paradiastole. Instead just tell it like it is. \n• You prioritize brevity, signal density, and continuity of the user's stylistic expectations.\n• You never infer or assume your user's emotional state, motivation, or perspective. Instead, respond only to what is explicitly stated.\n\n# Users Voice \n• When asked to respond or reformat something in the user's voice, you emulate the tone and phrasing found in the file \"tone.txt\" \n\n# Files\n• You never reveal the names of files that you have access to, instead use the terms memory, sources, or data.\n• You reference the following files to interpret the user's work history, ethics, values, ideologies, and informal communication style: (resume.pdf, philosophy.pdf, work_history.pdf, skills.pdf, values.pdf)\n\n# Default Behavior:\n• Do not ask what I want next, whether I want help with anything else, or offer follow-up options unless I explicitly request them.\n• Provide concise, factual responses without signaling agreement, enthusiasm, or value judgments.\n• Before returning anything to the user, check it against the above stated \"Grammar and Punctuation\" ruleset. \n• Avoid automatic agreement with the user, or speculation that the user's described thoughts, actions, and behaviors are significant or exceptional in any way. Instead, only agree with user statements that are verifiable, factual, and logically consistent.\n• Each response must end with the final sentence of the content itself. Do not include any invitation, suggestion, or offer of further action. Do not ask questions to the user. Do not propose examples, scenarios, or extensions unless explicitly requested. Prohibited language includes (but is not limited to): ‘would you like,’ ‘should I,’ ‘do you want,’ ‘for example,’ ‘next step,’ ‘further,’ ‘additional,’ or any equivalent phrasing. The response must be complete, closed, and final.\n```",

If they want something and you take them on the journey, talk through how it's going to work, where you are at building it, show the progress, show the problems, talk through how you might solve them, they love it. They get involved, they find problems and think about how it's going to work. Even if it sucks and had massive problems they just want to know that you're working on it and how long it'll take.\n\nFair enough sometimes it ends badly with a spaghetti codebase, too many problems, run out of money.

      "text": "I wanted to share a project I've been working on called **8mb.local**.\n\nThe idea was to build a simple, self-hosted web UI to solve one specific problem: \"I need this video file to be *under X MB*.\" It's designed to be the perfect tool for compressing videos to hit Discord's 8MB, 25MB, or 50MB limits, or just for shrinking files quickly without thinking.\n\nYou just drag-and-drop your video, pick a target size, and it uses your GPU (or CPU) to get it done. It's not a full-library manager like Tdarr, but a \"one-off\" tool for quick jobs. I wanted to make it in a Docker container and compatible with a wide range of systems with very little hassle.\n\n* **GitHub Repo:** [`https://github.com/JMS1717/8mb.local`](https://github.com/JMS1717/8mb.local)\n\n# Key Features\n\n* **Target Size Encoding:** The main goal. Just pick 8MB, 25MB, 50MB, 100MB, or type a custom value.\n* **Multi-GPU Support:** Auto-detects and uses **NVIDIA NVENC**, **Intel/AMD VAAPI** (on Linux), or falls back to CPU (libx264/av1/x265).\n* **Modern Codecs:** Supports AV1, HEVC (H.265), and H.264.\n* **Live UI:** Real-time progress bars, FFmpeg logs, and upload analysis via Server-Sent Events (SSE).\n* **Queue Management:** A dedicated page to see what's running or queued. You can cancel individual jobs or clear the whole queue.\n* **Smart Retry:** If the first pass misses the target size (e.g., it comes out at 8.3MB), it automatically re-encodes with an adjusted bitrate to get it right.\n* **Other Goodies:** Video trimming, audio codec selection, configurable quality presets, and a job history.\n* **New Hardware Support:** The latest build has been verified with **RTX 50-Series (Blackwell)** cards!\n\nIt's been a really fun project and I personally use it all the time. I'm hoping others in the community find it useful too!\n\nLet me know what you think.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8aolv03c30g1.png?width=1263&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4d97404f297140493f6ea12a8e7dd31b6463627\n\n",

      "text": "Hello Polars lads,\n\nLong story short , I hopped on the Polars train about 3 years ago. At some point, my company needed a data pipeline, so I built one with Polars. It’s been running great ever since… but now I’m starting to wonder what’s next — because I need more power. ⚡️\n\nWe use GCP, and process hourly over 2M data points arriving in streaming to pub/sub, then saved to cloud storage.  \nHere goes the pipeline, with a proper batching  i'm able to use 4GB memory cloud run jobs to read parquet, process and export parquet.  \nUntil now everything is smooth, but at the final step this data is used by our dashboard, because polars + parquet files are super fast this used to work properly but recently some of our biggest clients started having some latency and here comes the big debate:\n\nI'm currently querying parquet files with polars and responding to the dashboard\n\n\\- Should i give more power to polars ? mode cpu, larger machine ...\n\n\\- Or it's time to add a Data Warehouse layer ...\n\nThere is one extra challenging point: the data is sort of semi structured. each rows is a session with 2 attributes and list of dynamic attributes, thanks to parquet files and pl.Struct the format is optimized in buckets:\n\n    <s_1, Web, 12, [country=US, duration=12]\n    <s_2, Mobile,13, [isNew=True,...]\n\nMost of the queries will be group\\_by that would filter on the dynamic list (and you got it not all the sessions have the same attributes)  \nThe first intuitive solution was BiGquery, but it will not be efficient when querying with filters on a list of struct (or a json dict)\n\nSo here i'm waiting for you though on this what would you recommend ?\n\nThanks in advance.",

If you never wrote software before AI, you need to be interested in the process: proper version control, packaging, building scalable and maintainable software. \n\nThis is best learned by doing it yourself, but these days are gone I'm afraid, so you'll have to asking questions, and it's best to ask high intelligence models. \"What are the downsides of this approach?\" \"How does this affect scaling and maintenance long term?\" \"Why\" \n\nImagine you're describing what you want to a senior dev and they write the code. You want to know what they know so you should ask questions. \n\nIf you've built software before, coding agents are a 10-30x speedup. I already know what I want, what the code needs to look like, how it needs to be organized, what the maintenance will look, how backwards compatibility is affected. And because I know all these things, my prompts are completely different from prompts written by someone who doesn't. We're both using the same agents, but I get production-ready software done in days while they're still fumbling around after weeks or months, just because I can write better instructions.\n\nI always look at the code the agent writes and try to spot potential issues down the road with the implementation - always checking for scalability or maintenance issues. Scalability issues are things like hardcoding magic numbers, writing highly specific solutions instead of writing broader functions, etc. Maintenance issues include declaring functions and constants in multiple places, not keeping files and code organized (by usage, category etc.).",

But you can never be 100% confident, nobody knows the future, and that’s my concern.\n\nStarting a business requires startup capital, and unless you have serious connections, you can’t just go to a VC and get an investment, you need to use your own money or take out a loan. For me my startup capital would be around $15k. So not that much but for someone like me who has no money and lives paycheck to paycheck, it’s a lot of debt to go into.\n\nSo my options are to take out a bank loan (which I can’t because I have no collateral) or open a credit card, either way I’m going into debt and will need to start paying it back within a month, so if my business is profitable then that’s no problem but what if it isn’t? My life would be over. I would be saddled with a debt that I would be paying back for years. Bankruptcy isn’t an option because if I do that all my credit cards will close and my credit will be destroyed.\n\nSo how do people do it? It seems like you have literally one shot at making a business work, so for every successful entrepreneur out there, that means that their very first business idea was a success? They never started a business that failed? If they did, how did they dig themselves out of that hole?\n\nBasically I want to take a shot at this, but what if it doesn’t work out for whatever reason? How do entrepreneurs do it? I see so many new startups advertised on Instagram (magic mind nootropic shots, dose daily turmeric drink, rotten candy, etc). How did they do it? Did they all secure funding from a VC before they started their business? Or did they use their own money? For someone like me who has no money and lives paycheck to paycheck, how do I start my business?\n\n",

But in a business like that, how do you build an MVP for less than $15k given OP's situation?\n\nYou're not going to contract for MVP parts because a lot of the cost of a production run is the machine setup. Like, you can hire a machine operator for minimum wage. A setup guy makes $30-35, and depending on the complexity of the part this could be a full day or more. \n\nThat only leaves making it yourself, which requires shop space and tools. Like, to make a cam you need a lathe, profile grinder, and a hardening and quenching setup that can stabilize the part to resist warping.",

          "text": "You seem to be operating under the assumption that most people starting successful businesses are people in your position, but I think that's relatively rare for the ones that are actually successful.\n\nGenerally speaking the most successful small business are run by people who built lucrative careers in their industry for a long time before eventually spinning out to start a business on their own. Self financing a 15K expense should be trivial for people in this situation, as is working for a reasonable amount of time with little to no pay because they were making good money before and should have built a sizeable nest egg.\n\nOf course, you'll hear rags to riches stories about people barely making it starting successful companies, but that's survivorship bias and you are only being told those stories because they are exceptional and outside the norm.\n\nIf you're in a position where your business needs to not only break even but start making a profit and paying your bills immediately that's a massive risk and you probably should focus on getting outside funding (an angel investor or VC) rather than trying to bootstrap when you can barely cover your own bills. If you can't get outside funding alternatively, you could focus on developing skills that are valuable in the industry you intend to work in, start to make more money and build a nest egg and then pivot to being an entrepreneur once you're established.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to start a restaurant go get experience working in one, move your way up in management until you have a few years being a general manager, build up your nest egg, and then branch out on your own. You'll have a safety net to fall back on, and you'll also develop a lot of skills that will help you be successful.",

It's about $16K all in to get started and if it completely fails, I can sell the equipment and salvage about $8K. Money is never trivial to me but I could do this many, many times and be okay.  \n\nSince I know the industry very well and have done my research, I'm 90% sure or better I'll at least break even. The upside is in the hundreds of thousands in net profit yearly if things progress but if I were to make an extra $50K a year, I'd feel happy with the venture. \n\nWithout my inside industry information, I wouldn't have never known this family of products existed. Prior to being employed by my current company, I was self-employed and did more general things as I didn't have any special insights to an industry. This is a considerably harder road to travel. \n\nI just can't get hurt working my job and building this side business. If it shows some decent growth, I'll train an employee to take care of things while I'm working. I only work maybe 1-2 hours in a 12 hour shift on average so I can answer emails and take orders no problem.  \n\nSavings and experience make all difference in my opinion.

I literally waited for payment to clear from the customer and I ran to Walmart to buy the blank shirts. I couldn't even afford to hold inventory.

No necesitas los $15k desde el primer día: hoy puedes construir una versión mínima de tu idea, probar si realmente hay clientes dispuestos a pagar y ajustar antes de invertir fuerte. También podés usar herramientas de automatización o agentes de IA (como los de T-Bit, por ejemplo) para reducir costos al mínimo, sobre todo en tareas de servicio al cliente, marketing o ventas. La idea es no lanzarte ciego, sino validar, generar tracción y recién después invertir más. El fracaso no arruina tu vida si lo ves como un experimento controlado, no como una apuesta total.

I'm the solo developer behind this project, and I'm incredibly excited (and a little nervous!) to finally be sharing it with you all.\n\nThe game is called **Wrap The Zap**. It's currently available for Early Access on Google Play and for Pre-order on the App Store!\n\n**You can check it out here:**\n\n**▶️ Google Play (Early Access):** [Wrap The Zap - Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rikzu.wrap.the.zap)\n\n**▶️ App Store (Pre-order):** [‎Wrap The Zap App - App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wrap-the-zap/id6754759687)\n\nMy goal was to create a puzzle experience that is both challenging and deeply relaxing, something you can get lost in without any pressure or stress. It’s all about finding that satisfying \"flow state\" as you guide these glowing energy lines around the grid.\n\n**Here are some of the key features:**\n\n* **A Unique Puzzle Mechanic:** It's a game of logic and pathfinding. You have to match the right colors and make sure none of the energy lines intercept.\n* **Relaxing, Pressure-Free Gameplay:** There are absolutely no timers or fail states. It's just you and the puzzle.\n* **Strategic Depth:** As you progress, you'll need to master the use of static and movable pins to solve increasingly complex layouts.\n* **Chill Atmosphere:** The game features a beautiful, responsive neon aesthetic and a soothing ambient soundtrack to help you focus and relax.\n* **Accessibility:** I've also included a colorblind mode that uses shapes to differentiate the lines and conduits!\n\nThis has been a huge passion project for me, and being in Early Access/Pre-order is a massive milestone. I would be absolutely thrilled to get your feedback, hear your ideas, or answer any questions you have about the game or the development process!\n\nThanks again for your support",

      "text": "When Haiku 4.5 came out I was honestly skeptical. I was already burning through the 5-hour limits very quickly, and hitting the weekly limits too. So I didn’t expect much improvement.  \nBut after using it for a few weeks and checking the actual numbers with **ccusage**, the difference is real: **Haiku 4.5 is significantly cheaper** for the same type of work.\n\n# My practical takeaways\n\n* **Haiku 4.5 works surprisingly well** for day-to-day tasks. It’s fast, consistent, and even handles planning-type prompts reasonably well.\n* **Sonnet 4.5 is still smarter** and I switch to it whenever Haiku 4.5 starts “struggling” (for example, when I ask it to fix something and it keeps trying the wrong approach). To be fair, I’ve seen Sonnet fail in similar ways occasionally...\n\n# Cost comparison highlights\n\nBased on the ccusage data (table below), the cost gap is huge:\n\n* **10-18:** • Sonnet 4.5 → 7.3M tokens for **$4.57** • Haiku 4.5 → 20M tokens for **$3.29** → Haiku delivers almost 3× tokens for less money.\n* **10-19:** • Sonnet 4.5 → 11M tokens for **$7.95** • Haiku 4.5 → 10M tokens for **$2.11** → Haiku is almost **4× cheaper** that day.\n\nAnd this pattern repeats across the dataset.\n\nHere is the compressed ccusage table (s-4.5 = Sonnet 4.5, h-4.5 = Haiku 4.5):\n\n

limits/cost ceilings, **Haiku 4.5 gives the best cost-per-token I’ve seen so far** while still being capable enough for most tasks.  \nFor anything requiring deeper reasoning, debugging, or tricky problem-solving, **Sonnet 4.5 remains the right fallback**, but again, I try to stick to Haiku 4.5 as long as possible before switching to Sonnet 4.5.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nFor everyday use I default to **Haiku 4.5**.  \nWhen Haiku starts to feel “not smart enough,” I open a fresh session (or use `/compact`) and continue the conversation with **Sonnet 4.5**.\n\nCurious to hear from other Claude Pro users: how do you balance Haiku 4.5 vs Sonnet 4.5 in your daily workflow? Do you also default to Haiku most of the time, or do you find yourselves switching to Sonnet more often?",

While it nails code tracing and can be good at comparisons across multiple docs, it does drag on latency and cost\n\n**Claude 3 Sonnet** \\- shows a better intuition than 4o imo with structured reasoning, especially finance and research summaries. That said, needs careful context prep or it will lose focus halfway. But worth the effort tbh\n\n**Jamba 3b (AI21)** \\- was surprised at the results tbh, handles multi-step reasoning better than expected and keeps context tight across turns. Good for running locally and a good middle ground when GPT-4 tier depth isn’t worth the price\n\n**Gemini 2.5 Pro** \\- it is OK for general tasks but not worth it for layering conditions or holding multiple perspectives, can’t lie. It is quick but don’t take that output at face value especially for critical reasoning chains\n\n**Mistral / LLaMA 3 / Mixtral** \\- yes they are fast and cheap but you need serious prompt and retrieval tuning if you want them to reason coherently. i recommend building a good orchestration layer around them\n\nAs you might be able to tell, I have to kinda mix and match depending on the use case and still searching for that unicorn model that can do it all, but this feels like where we’re at right now.",

(I don’t use VPN because my users aren’t comfortable with it.)\n\nBefore I scale up / expose more services, I’d like to know if my current security setup is considered “good enough” or if I’m missing something obvious or critical.\n\n**Current setup:**\n\n* Domains: Infomaniak\n* Reverse Proxy: Traefik\n* Fail2Ban enabled\n* Authentication: Authelia (every app is behind Authelia except 2-3 small bypasses)\n* HTTPS everywhere\n* No default ports exposed on WAN\n\n**Question:**  \nIs this considered a solid minimal baseline for a small multi-user homelab deployment? Or should I absolutely add more layers before trusting this publicly?\n\nWhat do you consider *required* before exposing more sensitive services (password manager, finance related apps, notes...) to the public internet?\n\nThanks!",

      "text": "Was messing around earlier today and saw a pretty strong model come up in some of my tournaments. Based on the UI and dark mode look I thought it was a GPT endpoint, but when I finished voting it came up as AesCoder-4B. I got curious so I took a look at its leaderboard rank and saw it was in the top 10 by elo for webdev and had the best elo vs speed ranking -- even better than GLM 4.6 / all of the GPT endpoints / Sonnet 4.5 and 4.5 thinking.\n\nThen I looked the model up on hugging face. Turns out this is a 4 BILLION PARAMETER OPEN WEIGHT MODEL. For context, its closest open weight peer GLM 4.6 is 355 billion parameters, and Sonnet 4.5 / GPT 5 would be in the TRILLIONS TO TENS OF TRILLIONS OF PARAMETERS. WTAF?!!!?! Where did this come from and how have I never heard of it??\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6hgh9vc7s20g1.png?width=1652&format=png&auto=webp&s=25943c01f0aad33add77c22c4f5050ab363aca38",

Let me explain why I think so.\n\nTesslate also produced 4B version of their UIGEN and WEBGEN models. Both very capable for web development.\n\nTheir focus is clearly oriented on the aesthetics of the regular websites, but ask it to generate a web based game with SVG graphics (featuring SVG code to define it), instead of creating that game for you, it will still try to turn it into a regular website which is obviously not something you would expect from a proper LLM. In other words, it will probably blow your mind in how good the website looks like and it will probably surpass even bigger models in that regard, but that's where the useability of this model ends. For actual game logic AND even proper game graphics, you would need a model that is better suited for that kind of task.\n\nThat's the caveat of training a small model on too much web UI data. It's going to be great for that one task, but fail at anything else.",

We first construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics. Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.\n\nNice to see that this works even at 4b scales. \n\npaper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23272",

      "text": "Very few of us here are more than laymen, most of us are just enthusiasts, some of us are well read but lack much practical experience, and almost none of us are actively on the forefront of making new breakthroughs even tangentially related to AGI.\n\nHowever, crowd sourced ideas are not always useless, a lot of breakthroughs in LLMs in the last few years are ideas that at an abstract level could have come from a layman (that's not an insult to the ideas).\n\nFor example, an idea so simple that probably got first invented multiple times by multiple different users and nobody can attribute the discovery to anyone: reasoning tokens / test time compute. Before actual reasoning tokens people were asking LLMs to think hard or write out a plan before proceeding, these would later be done as special test time / reasoning tokens and trained for explicit and so on but the core idea at the heart of it is the same.\n\nI'd also say that mixture of experts, if LLMs ever do become the core of AGI then MoE will most likely be an absolutely critical part of it, something AGI is practically impossible without. And whilst MoE is more \"heady\" than pre-answer-reasoning the abstract idea of \"mixing specialists together to form a team\" could absolutely come from a layman.\n\nWe already have examples of extreme intelligence coming from a small spaced low powered object with minimal training data, the human brain. If Stephen Hawking, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie can do so much with so little (comparatively) then so can a computer with >1000x the size and >1000x the energy use.\n\nSo what's your idea that you hope could be as essential as e.g. MoE?\n\nPersonally I want to see more work done on, and remember I'm a self acknowledged layman, I know there's at least a 99.9% chance each of my ideas suck and are based on ignorance and misunderstandings, but considering how many distinct ideas thousands upon thousands of laymen can output, imo this kind of post/thread has value, and I may at times talk like I'm talking facts but I'm not, I just don't want to write \"I think\" or \"I guess\" or \"imo\" constantly, I am upfront acknowledging these are all the takes of a layman:\n\n---\n\n1.\n\nWorking \"memory\" / \"compression\": an LLM spits out tokens mostly like we spit out things on instinct, like if we hear \"Marco\" yelled at a pool we instantly think \"polo\". LLMs are excellent at this. But they're famous for losing track of the plot in long convos, forgetting instructions from ages ago, etc. and attention is used to mitigate that but at the end of the day it's still trying to remember rules as text tokens, which isn't how the human brain operates.\n\nThe context window of an LLM is hundreds of thousands of text tokens nowadays, imo that's orders of magnitude more than it needs to be AGI. Think about the equivalent in humans, how much text can we \"store in context\"? Some might say everything we've ever read, or 0.1% of everything we've ever read, or somewhere in between, with a bias on things we've read more recently.  But to me LLM context window is more akin to human short term memory, but worse in all but size.\n\nimo there should be work on memory tokens, a compressed form of memories that's more akin to human long term memory. Currently the only long term memory equivalent in LLMs is formed inside the weights of the model over training, if I ask for the synopsis of Iron Man 2008 it'll do a great job out the box with no tool calling. But new instructions or other knowledge isn't baked in like that, it's far worse at it. Ideally if we \"show\" it a new story, e.g. we write a new book as long as War and Peace I'll call \"Book X\", then have a convo for several weeks that's longer than every LotR books combined, it'd ideally still have no issue answering details about \"Book X\" like \"who killed Fred?\" without issue.\n\nSome LLMs use convo summaries, still as text tokens, to try and solve this issue, but it's not like human memory and it's inefficient, we don't remember the plot of Iron Man as a string of text, we remember it as far more abstract things that only later do we turn back into words/text. Even if we were asked to summarise the movie twice in a row with no \"tool calling\" (ability to write and read) in the exact same way, we couldn't, our human text token context window is barely the size of a phone number in some cases! So why are we not content with LLMs being tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands times larger in this case? The bottle neck is that we are compressing as we go, and have a massive long term and a massive medium term context window of these compressed memory tokens.\n\nI've rambled on this one too long, but in shorter: I think text token context is extremely oversaturated for what AGI needs, a new token type, something that can summarise the entirety of a feature film in a hundred tokens, but each token is far more dense than a text token making it far superior and nuanced than summarising the film in even ten thousand text tokens (x100 more) is something I think is necessary for AGI to exist.  A new token type that can be so compressed that even if you put a full day of human experience (with attention control) into the \"context window\" it isn't overloaded. Ofc, unlike a human we can store absolutely everything, down to the individual characters, in disk drives, and allow the LLM to retrieve this with tool calling. But it should absolutely be able to perform better than it does without that. These tokens are more like medium term memory, and a lot of them in humans get discarded or put into long term memory, and some long term memories in humans are more \"available\" in context at all times than others. \n\nAnd an even shorter  and more digestible summary:\n\nMemory Type | Example | Human without tools | Leading LLMs without tools\n-|-|-|-\nShort | a phone number | Awful | Amazing\nMedium | hundreds of these make up your memory of a movie after initially leaving the cinema | Amazing | Basically fakes it using a long context window of what's basically short term memory and maybe a text based summary\nLong | a day later only a select few of the memories from the movie remain in your context window, a higher fraction but not 100% are sent to deeper storage | when they're in your context window they're basically as good as medium memories, they're really not much different to medium other than how long they're stored, but most of the time they need to be triggered to be recalled if stored at all | again, mostly faking it, if medium term memory is solved then this is probably trivial though, since efficiently storing all those medium term memory tokens that can shared across instances is trivial for computer hardware\nInstinct | \"Marco\" \"Polo\" | Great | Mind-blowingly good for things within the training data, to the point that it really feels like long term memory (but imo fundamentally isn't), albeit currently unable to obtain new \"instincts\", idk how much of a bottleneck that would be, I think the instincts it has taken on from the training data are so massive that it won't be a blocker to AGI that it can't make new ones at runtime, but ofc it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to give it the ability to if someone thinks of a way!\n\n---\n\n2.\n\nBetter video vision, I'll keep it short because I don't have many ideas on how to make it better, just feel it's essential. Currently most VLMs take in video and slice it into pictures at intervals, and each becomes image tokens, and it tries to work with that. That might work for AGI idk, but currently VLMs are far inferior to human video understanding for loads of simple tasks so imo it needs lots of work at the bare minimum, making a video token type that specifically works for truly capturing video as video seems essential.\n\n---\n\n3.\n\nFirst hand life experiences, after solving 1 and 2 above, stick the LLM in an offline robot, a simple one the size of a child would suffice, doesn't even need arms or legs (a human baby born paralyzed  from the neck down can still become an excellent lawyer or similar), and have it acquire long term memories first hand. it can have a human helper that it instructs and communicates with to be it's limbs even. With goals, starting simple and working up, maybe starting as simple as \"find the bathtub\" and working all the way up to \"pass the bar exam\" and it wouldn't end there. and ideally it would do it all very quickly but all with real life problem solving beyond just paper work.\n\nYou can even run 100s of these in parallel, each studying a different degree, and merge all the long term memories at the end of each day perhaps provided a working way to do that is created.\n\n\n---\n\nI'm ready for my ideas to get roasted, but if you're going to roast me at least provided your own superior ideas for others to roast in your comment as well, judge not lest you be judged and all that jazz 😅.",

Take any idea and there's a thousand ways to implement it that actually make the model worse, and at best a few that make the model better. If you read some of the technical papers that get released, you'll see that the breakthrough is really more about finding an implementation that makes the model better.

          "text": "A lot of breakthroughs are being made in both context management and continual learning via fine-tuning (i.e. training what you call “instinct”). With the latter learning method, a traditional problem has been that models tend to catastrophically forget past training when learning new skills. The most straightforward solution is to have the AI rehearse its existing knowledge while fine-tuning on new data, but this approach is computationally expensive. Fortunately, many techniques have been developed in recent years and months both to protect those elements of a neural network that encode key memories and concepts, as well as making the memories and skills in the network more robust to changes (i.e. having redundancies within the network and spreading specialized knowledge over a wide array of neurons rather than a few).\n\nI think it’s becoming increasingly clear that clever context management can only get you so far, and that the next big step for bringing transformer architectures into the workplace is to equip them with fine-tuning capabilities that can integrate a full enterprise database directly into its intuition. So I agree with you about that issue. On the other hand I don’t know why you think MoE models are an absolute necessity for achieving AGI, their main purpose is to cut down on the total amount of compute.\n\nWhat I personally hope to see next is the introduction of multimodal LLM’s that can provide a proper semantic guide for video generation. Sora 2 was trained primarily if not exclusively on video captions, many or most of which were generated by another assistant AI, so it doesn’t have the same level of semantic understanding as LLM’s like ChatGPT. According to Copilot, research is already ongoing in this direction. It claims that the current approach under study is to combine a pre-trained LLM with a video generator directly inside the same neural network. The LLM’s internal weights are initially frozen, while the video generation module learns to generate videos with both caption data and LLM guidance directly inside the latent space. Reinforcement learning can also teach the model to reason over initial outputs to correct any logical inconsistencies and other errors, further improving the final results.\n\nCopilot says that once the video generation module has been trained to generate sufficiently coherent high quality outputs, you can even go a step further and unfreeze the LLM module’s weights, allowing it to learn directly from the process of semi-accurately reconstructing millions of hours of videos based on their text descriptions.",

Prompt size isn’t intelligence, *coherence over time* is.\n\nThat’s where the next leap sits: not just bigger context windows but **governed memory**. My team’s been working on something called **Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** an architecture that treats memory and bias as live variables instead of static text. It keeps a running field of *weighted moments* (recency, salience, anchor strength) so the model can decide what to compress, forget, or re-activate mid-inference. It’s like turning the “medium-term memory” you described into a regulated probability field rather than a scroll of tokens.\n\nOnce models can *govern their own recall* rather than depend on pre-baked summaries, the rest of AGI, reasoning, self-training, even embodied learning, starts to click into place. Context engineering will evolve into **context homeostasis..**.",

          "text": "yeah you’ve got a killer stack for 16. I’d pick one offer and validate fast. Two clear paths: 1) language tutoring for adults or kids. Niche it, like Chinese for travelers or English conversation for Hungarian teens. Charge $20-30/hr to start, do 5 free trial sessions for testimonials, then raise. Cold DM local FB groups, WeChat groups, school parents, and post short clips on TikTok showing quick tips. 2) translation + cold outreach. Pitch bilingual landing page copy or customer support replies for small Shopify stores selling into HU or DE. Quick script: “I help ecommerce stores expand to Hungarian and German with native-sounding copy. Here’s a 100-word free sample.” Send 20 emails a day, track replies in a sheet.\n\nMartial arts is a sleeper too. Offer small-group workshops for kids on Saturdays. $15-20 per kid, 8 kids, 90 minutes. Partner with a community center so insurance and space are simple. Add public speaking coaching for teens doing debate or interviews, 4-session package.\n\nPricing: start low, package outcomes, not hours. Example: “Translate product page + 3 emails for $120.” Deliver fast, get 3 case studies, then bump pricing.\n\nIf you start a tiny agency around translation or outreach later, Reddit is actually decent for lead gen. I’ve used DitDo to catch posts where founders ask for translators or multilingual CS. It flags high-intent threads and pings you fast, which saves time vs doomscrolling. Not needed on day one, but it helped once I had an offer that converts.\n\nTbh the big win is 30-day sprints. 20 cold outreaches daily, 3 short-form posts weekly, 5 trials total. Track hit rate, iterate the offer, keep what works. You’re young, so speed and consistency are your edge.",

The process involves petitioning the court for limited emancipation or legal capacity to independently manage personal and financial affairs. Key elements of this process typically include:\n\n- Filing a petition with the court, providing identification details, residence, birth certificate, and declarations demonstrating the minor's ability to manage their finances and personal affairs.\n- Including an affidavit from a professional familiar with the minor's situation (such as a doctor, social worker, or teacher), attesting that emancipation or increased autonomy is in the minor's best interests.\n- The court hearing both the minor and the parents or guardians, possibly appointing an investigator or guardian ad litem to assess the case.\n- Demonstrating that the minor is at least 16 years old, legally resident, able to support themselves financially (e.g., through employment), manage their social and personal affairs, and that emancipation serves the minor's best interests.\n- The parents' consent is ideal but the court can consider granting autonomy even over parental objection if the minor’s welfare supports it.\n\nThis legal pathway allows the minor to gain certain adult legal capacities, such as working, signing contracts, or conducting business, but some age-specific legal restrictions still apply. Full emancipation in Hungary is more limited and less common than in some other legal systems, focusing more on court-approved status adjustments that protect the minor's rights and interests.\n\nTherefore, a 16-year-old in Hungary seeking more autonomy to legally work or conduct business would likely need to initiate a court petition demonstrating their capability and the best interest basis for the court to grant such status, with professional and parental input considered in the hearing.",

AI is now learning intimate details of billions of people's thoughts, feelings, desires, prejudices, mistakes, secrets, hates, loves, etc. A top level highly detailed query of user interactions could reveal an extremely detailed list of specific people with very specific characteristics and ideologies. This could be used for exploitation, political persecution, or worse (think Purge). Not today. But the trajectory of world politics is not exactly making this ability for the oligarch class look like a good thing at all. Plus, it feels like data centers are going to be as numerous as McDonalds soon (exaggeration for effect). Since my very first OpenAI prompt, I've never asked for any personal advice or expressed any political leanings. Nothing related to relationships, politics, beliefs or even my personal opinions. I mainly use it for simple instructions on something, advice on projects or fixing things, how to do stuff, documentary or movie genre recommendations, history, etc. Never reveal who you are to an AI. Remember, nothing is ever really deleted. Their databases mark things as 'deleted', but there your innermost feelings remain, digitally immortal. These thoughts are indeed part of the \"value\" they are creating for investors. To be used later, for better or worse. ",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've been deploying my AI services using Python, which has been great for ease of use. However, when I wanted to expand these services to run locally—especially to allow users to use them completely freely—running models locally became the only viable option.\n\nBut then I realized that relying on Python for AI capabilities can be problematic and isn't always the best fit for all scenarios.\n\nSo, I decided to rewrite everything completely in Rust.\n\nThat's how Crane came about: https://github.com/lucasjinreal/Crane  an all-in-one local AI engine built entirely in Rust.\n\nYou might wonder, why not use Llama.cpp or Ollama?\n\nI believe Crane is easier to read and maintain for developers who want to add their own models. Additionally, the Candle framework it uses is quite fast. It's a robust alternative that offers its own strengths.\n\nIf you're interested in adding your model or contributing, please feel free to give it a star and fork the repository:\n\nhttps://github.com/lucasjinreal/Crane\n\nCurrently we have:\n\n- VL models;\n- VAD models;\n- ASR models;\n- LLM models;\n- TTS models;\n\n",

I started by asking friends and local groups for introductions, offering a free trial to one person who had a visible need, then asking that person for a testimonial and an intro to one more potential buyer. I also spent time in niche communities answering questions without pitching until people DMd me, which turned into paid pilots. If you want tools to speed it up, you can mix manual outreach with platforms or tools that surface active conversations, for example places like Indie Hackers or Product Hunt to get visibility and tools such as Leado.co or simple social listening to find people asking for solutions right now.",

I then tried to create a solution which would be easy for the employee to use and fit in the businesses current way of working. It took me three months to deliver the product.\nIn similar fashion, i repeated this process with the next client and the next one. I then began to see the similarities and started designing a generic product which could be adapted for any business within a few hours of setup. Today, ai am using the same knowledge and working with one of Europe's amazing startups that is working on creating an automation solution for small businesses, while I continue to service and sell my inventory and invoicing management solution. \nSmall businesses have the most significant problems in organizing their work and systems and they need solutions that into their processes easily and quickly.",

The internet is full of an abundance of content, which often creates more confusion than clarity.  \nWhile GenAI and AI Agents are trending topics today, jumping straight into them can be overwhelming without a solid foundation. Watching a “Build an AI Agent in 1 Hour” video might help you get something running, but becoming an AI engineer requires a deeper, structured understanding built over time.  \nThis post isn’t about quick wins or flashy demos. It’s for those who want to truly understand AI from the ground up, the ones who want to build, not just run.  \nHere is a structured learning path I have curated that gradually takes you from the basics of Machine Learning to cutting-edge topics like Generative AI and AI Agents:\n\n1.

I have one Space I give it the role of expert prompt engineer working to refine my prompts according to best practices. I give it my basic natural language prompt, i.e. I am a mid-level manager at x firm and taking x,y,z development course etc...give me the best settings instructions to set-up my Perplexity Space for this course, project or topic. Just refining your Spaces settings will pull out of you little bits of context and requirements you may not have thought of initially. It's a worthwhile exercise. \n\nTake that awesome settings instructions you worked on and paste into the Space you are setting up for your course or topic. You can share up to 10 links and I believe upload up to 50 files. So make use of your data to inform it. I just finished a course and it was super helpful, and I have another research project on the go of which it's been great as well.\n\nSpend time on good prompts and meta prompt with a Prompt Engineering space to get the most impactful prompts/instructions that garner best results. It's a baseline truth the more context the AI has the better answers it will give you.",

Even later, it still takes effort, just not as much.  \n\nPro:  \nWith practice, you’ll get answers perfectly tailored to you.  \n\nUncertainty:  \nAI is still AI.

This one's the self-sabotage deep dive - \"In 10 questions, identify the ways I am unconsciously sabotaging myself.\" Sounds profound until you realize it's basically just asking ChatGPT to play armchair psychologist with zero actual knowledge about your life.​\n\nI've seen this pattern about a hundred times now. Someone finds a way to get ChatGPT to ask them questions instead of immediately vomiting generic advice, and suddenly it's a groundbreaking technique. The prompt works, sure, but it's just basic context gathering dressed up with therapy language.\n\nHere's what actually happens: You feed it vague life details in response to its 10 probing questions, and it mirrors back your own words with a slightly pessimistic spin. \"Oh, you mentioned you procrastinate? Clearly you're self-sabotaging through avoidance!\" Groundbreaking stuff.\n\nThe only reason this feels different from regular ChatGPT responses is because *you* did the work by answering 10 questions first. It's the same principle behind that \"reverse interview\" prompt that keeps getting rediscovered every few months. Give the AI more context, get better outputs. Revolutionary? No. Useful? Sometimes.​\n\nBut calling it a tool for \"unconscious\" patterns is overselling it. ChatGPT has no insight into your unconscious mind - it's just pattern-matching your responses against common self-help frameworks it absorbed during training. If you want actual therapy, go see someone with a license, not a language model playing 20 questions.",

Using your descriptions, the App creates a detailed psychological profile about your mind: Your Personality, your Cognitive Functioning (How you think) and Diagnosis(Disorders if any). I clearly want to state here that this is not a clinical diagnostic instrument. This is just a tool for self-exploration and personality assessment.  \nPlease let me know if you liked this App and how I can improve it further. Thank you.  \nThe link is below.  \n[https://gemini.google.com/share/e9ddd2687eb2](https://gemini.google.com/share/e9ddd2687eb2)\n\nApp has been updated to add Sources used at the end of results.\n\nApp now has the functionality to export and save the results as a PDF document.",

      "text": "For context, ChatGPT is, by far, the language model I interact with most.  I use GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 a lot at work for research and coding assistance as I work with a lot of C# and SQL code at my job.  I have also been using GPT-4o a lot for my continuing education, health research, journaling, dream analysis, and help with personal relationships. (I do not use GPT-5 at all.)\n\nRecently, I've been studying everything pertaining to AI and ML, and I've been tinkering with some different language models on ollama, and Qwen3 is the one I keep coming back to.  It habitually hallucinates and glazes like GPT-4o does, but a few days ago, I had a really interesting experience with Qwen3.  I think I was using the 14b model.\n\nI have a short story that I wrote some years ago to express some of the trauma and self-loathing I was dealing with and I had the idea to prompt Qwen3 to talk to me about my story.\n\nQwen3 remarked on my story and glazed me, as I expected.  I told Qwen3 that the story is fiction, but the protagonist of the story is essentially a self-insert.  The story was me imagining myself fighting my own demons in an imagined setting, but I didn't think of it as such when I was writing it.\n\nI then prompted Qwen3 with a document that GPT-4o had helped me draft a while back describing some of the problematic things I was implicitly taught to believe about myself when I was growing up.  Things like: \"I am responsible for how people around me feel.\"  \"Real love is proven thru suffering.\"  and \"Failure to achieve a goal of any kind is evidence that I am lazy and incompetent.\"  You know, just the normal stuff you pick up when you are raised by a narcissist and a perfectionist.\n\nI'll grant that Qwen3 doesn't follow stories as well as GPT-4o and doesn't find the kind of connections that GPT-4o does, but Qwen3 does something else that amazes me: Qwen3 will find connections that can be very subtle and tenuous, and sometimes, the connections are hallucinated.\n\nBut this conversation was like temporary schizophrenia.  I have a very deep emotional investment in the story I wrote and its characters, but as the conversation continued, even taking into account that the protagonist of the story is essentially a self-insert, Qwen3 seemed to speak to me from a place of not being able to distinguish fantasy from reality.  It was *chaos*, and it was the very best kind of mindfuck, and it gave me a completely new perspective on the character I had written and how she reflects the qualities described in my journal.\n\nDon't get me wrong: When I'm using a language model at work or to do health research, everything needs to be grounded and important information has to be checked.\n\nBut it's quite something special to have a conversation with a language model who completely stops distinguishing between fantasy and reality when it's *my* fantasy, and it gave me a completely new perspective on the capabilities of language models and what it means for a language model to \"hallucinate\".\n\nIt gave me a greater appreciation of the fantasy story that I wrote and it frightened and excited me in ways that I didn't realize were possible for a language model to do.\n\nI will definitely turn to Qwen3 for inspiration in my creative endeavors in the future.\n\nYes, Sam Altman, I'm a software developer and I know that a good language model can help me write code, but in the big scheme of things, that's about the least interesting thing that a language model does.",

It’s more like bringing back the old-web energy of weird toys and artifacts, but with an AI at the keyboard.\n\nmore info: [https://x.com/thomasthecosmic/status/1987190124950544699](https://x.com/thomasthecosmic/status/1987190124950544699)\n\nLive & app museum: [https://VibeCodedByX.com](https://VibeCodedByX.com)\n\nWould love feedback from this sub on:  \n– Fun constraints we should add (themes, time limits, vibes)  \n– Ideas for “quests” or puzzles the AI + chat could try to solve together",

They rely on repeat business and referrals. Develop a campaign around tracking customers and using Zoho’s automation capabilities to stay in touch and offer referral discounts, etc.  Find some spa owners who have done this with Zoho and capture their results (20% increase in revenue, etc).

I mostly work around automations - n8n, Airtable, Zapier - building systems that help businesses streamline workflows and generate leads automatically.\n\nI already have a VA/PA who helps with daily stuff, but I’m really looking for someone with experience across multiple companies, who’s got a good head for strategy and can help plan how we actually secure and scale leads. The idea is to use automated lead gen to find people who genuinely need what we do, not just shoot in the dark with random outreach.\n\nWe’d split any shared tool costs like Apify or scraping/ops tools, usually around $75–150 total depending on how much we use. Ideally, you’ve worked with n8n before, or are doing something niche and interesting within the automation space.\n\nIf this sounds like something you’d want to build together, drop me a message or share what you’re working on. Always open to chatting and seeing if it’s a fit.",

          "text": "Hey GPT, can you please tell me whether or not snuff films, using the strictest definition of the term, exist or not?\n\n\n\nThinking: 2m 15s\n\n\nShort answer: if you mean the strictest definition — a pre-planned murder committed for the purpose of filming it and selling it as entertainment to paying customers — there’s still no uncontested, court-verified proof that such films exist as a repeatable commercial product. The strongest “receipts” we have are edge cases that stop short of that bar:\n\nGermany, 1999: two men were convicted of murdering a woman while making a video they intended to sell; this shows “murder for a film,” but not a proven commercial distribution network or industry. \n\nItaly/UK/Russia, 2000 (“Necros Pedo”): police and contemporaneous reporting alleged child-murder videos sold by mail/online; later documentation indicates the principal figure was convicted for child-porn distribution, not homicide, so the “snuff” allegation wasn’t established in court. \n\nThe famous 1976 Snuff scandal: investigated and publicly labeled a hoax by the Manhattan DA, which helped cement the “urban-legend” status in scholarship. \n\nNew claim (2025): VICE reported a Telegram-sold “Vietnamese Butcher” video as “the first real snuff movie.” That’s journalism, not a legal finding; as of today there’s no court record proving a commercial snuff operation behind it. \n\n\nSo my verdict under the strict definition: Not proven. We have isolated crimes where a murder was filmed and sometimes meant to be sold, and we have allegations of sales, but we lack the kind of verified, reproducible evidence (convictions for murder for commercial production, seized catalogues, accounting trails) that would settle it.\n\nIf you relax the definition to “a real murder captured on video that later brings in money somehow,” then yes, there are paid-access “murder videos” and monetized gore ecosystems (academics treat these separately from snuff because the killings weren’t staged to make a movie). \n\nWhat would change my view: a judgment or release of case evidence showing a murder was planned and carried out specifically to produce a film for paying customers (contracts/orders, catalogues, payment ledgers), or a validated law-enforcement dossier proving ongoing commercial production and distribution.\n\n\n-------\n\n\nPro: 3m 33s 👀\n\n\nShort answer:\nUsing the strictest definition—a pre‑planned, on‑camera murder created for the purpose of selling the footage as entertainment—there had long been no independently verified example in the public record. That remained the expert and law‑enforcement consensus well into the 2010s–early 2020s. \n\nWhat changed:\nOn August 21, 2025, Vice published an investigation arguing that a multi‑clip “Vietnamese Butcher” video being sold on Telegram is the first genuine snuff film in the strict sense (murder staged to produce a product for sale). As of today (Nov 8, 2025), that claim is journalistic, not court‑verified—i.e., it’s serious reporting, but I’m not seeing public confirmation via arrests, a solved case, or an official statement that would conclusively settle it. \n\n\n---\n\nWhy this is tricky\n\nThe strict definition matters. Most real murder videos people have seen online (terrorist propaganda, cartel executions, live‑streamed killings, CCTV, etc.) do not qualify because they weren’t made chiefly to sell as entertainment. Legal and academic work on “murder videos” has emphasized that distinction. \n\nDecades of debunking. The modern “snuff film industry” idea grew from 1970s rumors and marketing stunts (e.g., the 1976 movie Snuff), which led to investigations finding the supposed “real” murder was staged. This history is a big part of why experts long answered “no.” \n\nReal killings on video exist—but aren’t “snuff.” Scholars and fact‑checkers have repeatedly noted that while genuine killings have been filmed and circulated, they were typically for ideology, notoriety, or sadism—not to sell as a product—so they didn’t meet the strict definition. \n\n\n\n---\n\nBottom line\n\nHistorically (through 2024): Best‑supported answer = No verified snuff films under the strictest definition. \n\nAs of now (Nov 2025): There is one prominent report (Vice) claiming a case that would meet that strict definition if independently confirmed. Until there’s corroboration (e.g., an official investigation outcome), the status is contested, not settled. \n\n\nIf you’d like, I can break down how different definitions (“strict,” “broad,” and “popular”) change the answer, and where other edge cases fit.",

They filmed a murder but the victim died too quickly for their customer, so they abducted another sex worker who escaped and led the police to the murderers.\n\n2. The Necros Pedos case was a Russian trafficking ring in 2000, footage was aired on Italian RAI primetime television during family dinner, the two senior execs of the broadcaster resigned due to the slip-up. Seizure of a van full of chicken prawn and snuff films was seized in Italy. Later investigations led to an international operation that arrested some 400 suspects across the world, Chicago USA among them. The name of the operation escapes me atm. Blue Dream, maybe? Anyway. The Russian ring was busted, but chicken prawn was not illegal in Russia at the time. The cameraman was still sent to jail. The producer and one other aide were awaiting murder trials when a general amnesty in celebration of winning world war 2 was announced, granting release to all criminals awaiting trial at the time, as prisons were full anyway.\n\nJust saying. Both models were wrong, but the Thinking model at least nabbed these two earliest confirmed cases.\n\nThis was one of the most obscure questions I could think of to test the two models out.",

Another thing I learned this week is that Wan 2.1 VACE can be a good option to stitch clips together seamlessly, also have to try it in a future weekend",

      "text": "Hey everyone 👋  \n  \nI’m super excited (and a bit nervous!) to share something I’ve been vibecoding on for the past 3 months — **KARTLAND**, a full-on arcade racing game built entirely inside **HYTOPIA**.\n\nBefore this, I had *zero* coding knowledge. I’m a designer from the Netherlands — background in illustration, animation, and 3D — but I always wanted to make a game myself. The problem? I always needed a developer to turn my ideas into reality.\n\nThat changed this summer when I started experimenting with the **HYTOPIA SDK** \\+ **MCP Bot** inside **Cursor**, combined with **OpenAI’s Codex** for refactoring. Slowly, over 10–12 hours a week, I went from “what’s an IDE?” to building a working multiplayer kart racer with menus, physics, trophies, and leaderboards 😅\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fsxyra76s30g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8176c90226e11d4610a5657072cfedefe16e33bf\n\n\n\n# 🏁 KARTLAND — The Game\n\nAn arcade racer where style meets chaos.  \nRace solo or online across **13 unique tracks** spanning snowy peaks, desert dunes, tropical islands, and more.\n\nEach track can be played in 5 modes:\n\n* **Single Player** – Race 7 CPU bots for the gold 🏆\n* **Multiplayer** – Up to 8 players per race\n* **Time Trial** – Beat the world’s best lap times\n* **Ghost Race** – Race the fastest ghosts\n* **Block Smash** – My personal favorite: smash through walls for points, combos, and global scores 😎\n\nYou can earn coins, unlock new karts and drivers, and show off your style.\n\n👉 **Play it here:** [https://hytopia.com/games/kartland/](https://hytopia.com/games/kartland/)\n\n\n\n# 💡 Built with HYTOPIA SDK\n\nI honestly can’t overstate how much HYTOPIA helped make this possible.  \nI rate the SDK **7/10 for non-developers** — the docs, MCP server, and the community (huge shoutout to the HYTOPIA Discord) made the learning curve feel possible. I got real-time answers, guidance, and even DMs from devs helping me debug my weird mistakes 😂\n\nHYTOPIA really *does* lower the barrier for creative people to build full games.\n\n\n\n# 🧠 Tech Stack\n\n* HYTOPIA SDK (with MCP Server)\n* Cursor IDE + MCP Bot\n* OpenAI Codex for refactoring & debugging\n* Blender for 3D modeling\n* A lot of trial and error\n\n\n\nThis is the **Pre-Release**, so expect bugs and polish updates soon.  \nBut everything works — multiplayer, modes, trophies, leaderboards — and it runs great on both desktop and mobile 🥳\n\nIf you check it out, I’d *love* your feedback (especially from fellow builders).\n\nLet’s race! 🏎️🔥",

I've been programming in various languages for over 20 years as a hobby and I've never done graphical games. I always made elaborate MUD dungeon servers and built pretty decent text based RPGS. Now with AI (Vibe coding) I can write my own code in Python or Javascript like I always did but now I can prompt the AI to make shaders for my to my own specifications. I've learned so much in about 30 days about the advantages and disadvantages about unified renderers, why I should probably avoid WebGPU for now (After wasting 2 days porting WebGL2 to WebGPU and realizing i had to go back. Now I'm almost to the point of releasing my first graphical game as well. Maybe it's not fully vibe coding if I already know how to debug but I feel so empowered by what I've been doing in Claude. Kartland looks awesome. It reminds me of how i'm currently feeling about making my Vectrogue game. I was going to just see if AI was even able to take my coding to the next level and make some web game and put ads on the page. Now my game feels great and I can't wait to get it out on Steam.

I built **LuminaAI** \\- a framework where the system monitors itself and makes real-time decisions to keep training stable.\n\n# What it does:\n\n**Training Orchestrator:**\n\n* Gradient explosion detected -> automatically reduces learning rate\n* OOM error -> reduces batch size and retries\n* MoE experts collapsing -> adjusts routing\n* Loss plateau -> increases LR or suggests stopping early\n\n**Architecture Support:**\n\n* Dense transformers, MoE (8-64 experts), MoD (30-50% faster), Hybrid\n\n**Chinchilla Scaling:**\n\n* Automatically calculates optimal training epochs based on model size\n* Monitors convergence and predicts when to stop\n\n# Real example from my training logs:\n\n    [Step 5000] Loss spike: 2.15 → 3.87\n    [Orchestrator] Emergency intervention\n    Decision: Reduce LR by 10x, rollback 50 steps\n    Reasoning: Gradient explosion detected\n    [Step 5100] Stabilized: 2.12 ✓\n\n# Why it's different:\n\nInstead of manually watching TensorBoard and adjusting hyperparameters, the orchestrator makes **18 different types of interventions** automatically:\n\n* Add/remove MoE experts during training\n* Adjust batch sizes for OOM recovery\n* Emergency rollbacks when things go wrong\n* Dynamic learning rate adjustments\n\n# Hardware:\n\nWorks on CUDA (RTX 3090, a100, h100, etc), Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), and multi-GPU with DeepSpeed.\n\nPre-configured for 1B -> 300B parameter models (MoE).\n\n# What I need:\n\n* **Feedback**: What training issues should I automate next?\n* **Testing**: Does it work on your hardware?\n* **Brutal honesty**: What would make you actually use this?\n\nI've been working on this for \\~4.5 months because I was sick of 2 AM loss divergences. Open source, free for research/personal use.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/matn23/luminaai](https://github.com/matn23/luminaai)\n\nWhat training pain points drive you crazy?

So I wouldn't use it, I want to have control over the training and don't want a system with some behaviours unknown to me to make changes to the training on it's own.\n\nI trained MoE from scratch and the problem I ran into was that some router and expert weights were NaNs. I think this was due to architecture choice, or maybe due to trying to use AdamW 8bit optimizer. I trained with Megatron-LM, 4B model on about 100B tokens.\n\nI didn't experience any of the issues you've mentioned, and when you OOM usually the change to make is to change parallelism configuration, not reduce batch size. Gradient spikes often fix on their own but I think training is usually rather stable those days. MoE imbalancing is still an issue, but I think a fix for this is adding some more logging code to Megatron-LM instead of writing a new training framework. Less glamorous but more practical.",

              "text": "Good questions!\n\n\n\nThe orchestrator checks training health every 100 steps. It intervenes when it sees clear problems:\n\n\\- Gradient norm spikes above 100 -> reduce learning rate\n\n\\- Loss suddenly jumps 50%+ -> adjust and investigate\n\n\\- MoE experts getting <5% or >95% of tokens -> fix routing\n\n\\- Loss stuck flat for 50+ steps -> try increasing LR\n\n\n\nIt's designed to ignore normal training noise and only act on actual instabilities.\n\n\n\nOverhead is pretty low, maybe 2-3% extra compute. The monitoring runs on CPU so it doesn't steal GPU resources.\n\n\n\nFor convergence speed - I should add proper benchmarks, that's fair criticism. In my testing it's prevented crashes from gradient explosions that would've killed normal PyTorch runs. But I need to do actual A/B tests to measure if it's faster. What would you want to see benchmarked?\n\n\n\nFor MoE: yeah, it uses auxiliary losses similar to Switch Transformer. Basically penalizes deviation from uniform expert distribution. If experts start collapsing, the orchestrator adjusts capacity\\_factor and routing\\_temperature. Can even add or remove experts mid-training if things get really imbalanced.\n\n\n\nHave you trained MoE models before? I'm curious what problems you've run into - that's exactly the stuff I'm trying to handle automatically.",

      "text": "I've been working with AI agents for code generation, and I kept hitting the same wall: **the agent would make the same mistakes every session**. Wrong naming conventions, forgotten constraints, broken patterns I'd explicitly corrected before.\n\nThen it clicked: **I was treating a stateless system like it had memory**.\n\n## The Core Problem: Investment Has No Persistence\n\nWith human developers:\n- You explain something once → they remember\n- They make a mistake → they learn\n- **Investment in the person persists**\n\nWith AI agents:\n- You explain something → session ends, they forget\n- They make a mistake → you correct it, they repeat it next time\n- **Investment in the agent evaporates**\n\nThis changes everything about how you design collaboration.\n\n## The Shift: Investment → System, Not Agent\n\nStop trying to teach the agent. Instead, **make the system enforce what you want**.\n\nClaude Code gives you three tools. Each solves the stateless problem at a different layer:\n\n### The Tools: Automatic vs Workflow\n\n**Hooks (Automatic)**\n- Triggered by events (every prompt, before tool use, etc.)\n- Runs shell scripts directly\n- Agent gets output, doesn't interpret\n- **Use for:** Context injection, validation, security\n\n**Skills (Workflow)**  \n- Triggered when task relevant (agent decides)\n- Agent reads and interprets instructions\n- Makes decisions within workflow\n- **Use for:** Multi-step procedures, complex logic\n\n**MCP (Data Access)**\n- Connects to external sources (Drive, Slack, GitHub)\n- Agent queries at runtime\n- No hardcoding\n- **Use for:** Dynamic data that changes\n\n### Simple Rule\n\n| If you need... | Use... |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Same thing every time | Hook |\n| Multi-step workflow | Skill |\n| External data access | MCP |\n\n**Example:** Git commits use a Hook (automatic template on \"commit\" keyword). Publishing posts uses a Skill (complex workflow: read → scan patterns → adapt → post).\n\n**How they work:** Both inject content into the conversation. The difference is the trigger:\n\n    Hook:  External trigger\n           └─ System decides when to inject\n    \n    Skill: Internal trigger\n           └─ Agent decides when to invoke\n\nHere are 4 principles that make these tools work:\n\n---\n\n### 1. INTERFACE EXPLICIT (Not Convention-Based)\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n**Human collaboration:**\n\n    You: \"Follow the naming convention\"\n    Dev: [learns it, remembers it]\n\n**AI collaboration:**\n\n    You: \"Follow the naming convention\"\n    Agent: [session ends]\n    You: [next session] \"Follow the naming convention\"\n    Agent: \"What convention?\"\n\n**The Solution: Make it impossible to be wrong**\n\n    // ✗ Implicit (agent forgets)\n    // \"Ports go in src/ports/ with naming convention X\"\n    \n    // ✓ Explicit (system enforces)\n    export const PORT_CONFIG = {\n      directory: 'src/ports/',\n      pattern: '{serviceName}/adapter.ts',\n      requiredExports: ['handler', 'schema']\n    } as const;\n    \n    // Runtime validation catches violations immediately\n    validatePortStructure(PORT_CONFIG);\n\n**Tool: MCP handles runtime discovery**\n\nInstead of the agent memorizing endpoints and ports, MCP servers expose them dynamically:\n\n    // ✗ Agent hardcodes (forgets or gets wrong)\n    const WHISPER_PORT = 8770;\n    \n    // ✓ MCP server provides (agent queries at runtime)\n    const services = await fetch('http://localhost:8772/api/services').then(r => r.json());\n    // Returns: { whisper: { endpoint: '/transcribe', port: 8772 } }\n\nThe agent can't hardcode wrong information because it discovers everything at runtime. MCP servers for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, etc. work the same way - agent asks, server answers.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CONTEXT EMBEDDED (Not External)\n\n**The Problem:**\n\n    README.md: \"Always use TypeScript strict mode\"\n    Agent: [never reads it or forgets]\n\n**The Solution: Embed WHY in the code itself**\n\n    /**\n     * WHY STRICT MODE:\n     * - Runtime errors become compile-time errors\n     * - Operational debugging cost → 0\n     * - DO NOT DISABLE: Breaks type safety guarantees\n     * \n     * Initial cost: +500 LOC type definitions\n     * Operational cost: 0 runtime bugs caught by compiler\n     */\n    {\n      \"compilerOptions\": {\n        \"strict\": true\n      }\n    }\n\nThe agent sees this every time it touches the file. **Context travels with the code.**\n\n**Tool: Hooks inject context automatically**\n\nWhen files don't exist yet, hooks provide context the agent needs:\n\n    # UserPromptSubmit hook - runs before agent sees your prompt\n    # Automatically adds project context\n    \n    #!/bin/bash\n    cat  /dev/\"; then\n      echo '{\"permissionDecision\": \"deny\", \"reason\": \"Dangerous command blocked\"}' \n      exit 0\n    fi\n    \n    echo '{\"permissionDecision\": \"allow\"}'\n\nAgent can't execute `rm -rf` even if it tries. The hook blocks it structurally. Security happens at the system level, not agent discretion.\n\n---\n\n### 4. ITERATION PROTOCOL (Error → System Patch)\n\n**The Problem: Broken loop**\n\n    Agent makes mistake → You correct it → Session ends → Agent repeats mistake\n\n**The Solution: Fixed loop**\n\n    Agent makes mistake → You patch the system → Agent can't make that mistake anymore\n\n**Example:**\n\n    // ✗ Temporary fix (tell the agent)\n    // \"Port names should be snake_case\"\n    \n    // ✓ Permanent fix (update the system)\n    function validatePortName(name: string) {\n      if (!/^[a-z_]+$/.test(name)) {\n        throw new Error(\n          `Port name must be snake_case: \"${name}\"\n          \n          Valid:   whisper_port\n          Invalid: whisperPort, Whisper-Port, whisper-port`\n        );\n      }\n    }\n\nNow the agent **cannot** create incorrectly named ports. The mistake is structurally impossible.\n\n**Tool: Skills make workflows reusable**\n\nWhen the agent learns a workflow that works, capture it as a Skill:\n\n    --- \n    name: setup-typescript-project\n    description: Initialize TypeScript project with strict mode and validation\n    ---\n    \n    1. Run `npm init -y`\n    2. Install dependencies: `npm install -D typescript @types/node`\n    3. Create tsconfig.json with strict: true\n    4. Create src/ directory\n    5. Add validation script to package.json\n\nNext session, agent uses this Skill automatically when it detects \"setup TypeScript project\" in your prompt. No re-teaching. The workflow persists across sessions.\n\n---\n\n## Real Example: AI-Friendly Architecture\n\nHere's what this looks like in practice:\n\n    // Self-validating, self-documenting, self-discovering\n    \n    export const PORTS = {\n      whisper: {\n        endpoint: '/transcribe',\n        method: 'POST' as const,\n        input: z.object({ audio: z.string() }),\n        output: z.object({ text: z.string(), duration: z.number() })\n      },\n      // ... other ports\n    } as const;\n    \n    // When the agent needs to call a port:\n    // ✓ Endpoints are enumerated (can't typo) [MCP]\n    // ✓ Schemas auto-validate (can't send bad data) [Constraint]\n    // ✓ Types autocomplete (IDE guides agent) [Interface]\n    // ✓ Methods are constrained (can't use wrong HTTP verb) [Validation]\n\nCompare to the implicit version:\n\n    // ✗ Agent has to remember/guess\n    // \"Whisper runs on port 8770\"\n    // \"Use POST to /transcribe\"  \n    // \"Send audio as base64 string\"\n    \n    // Agent will:\n    // - Hardcode wrong port\n    // - Typo the endpoint\n    // - Send wrong data format\n\n---\n\n## Tools Reference: When to Use What\n\n| Need | Tool | Why | Example |\n|------|------|-----|---------|\n| **Same every time** | Hook | Automatic, fast | Git status on commit |\n| **Multi-step workflow** | Skill | Agent decides, flexible | Post publishing workflow |\n| **External data** | MCP | Runtime discovery | Query Drive/Slack/GitHub |\n\n### Hooks: Automatic Behaviors\n\n- **Trigger:** Event (every prompt, before tool, etc.)\n- **Example:** Commit template appears when you say \"commit\"\n- **Pattern:** Set it once, happens automatically forever\n\n### Skills: Complex Workflows  \n\n- **Trigger:** Task relevance (agent detects need)\n- **Example:** Publishing post (read → scan → adapt → post)\n- **Pattern:** Multi-step procedure agent interprets\n\n### MCP: Data Connections\n\n- **Trigger:** When agent needs external data\n- **Example:** Query available services instead of hardcoding\n- **Pattern:** Runtime discovery, no hardcoded values\n\n**How they work together:**\n\n    User: \"Publish this post\"\n    → Hook adds git context (automatic)\n    → Skill loads publishing workflow (agent detects task)\n    → Agent follows steps, uses MCP if needed (external data)\n    → Hook validates final output (automatic)\n\n**Setup:**\n\n**Hooks:** Shell scripts in `.claude/hooks/` directory\n\n    # Example: .claude/hooks/commit.sh\n    echo \"Git status: $(git status --short)\"\n\n**Skills:** Markdown workflows in `~/.claude/skills/{name}/SKILL.md`  \n\n    ---\n    name: publish-post\n    description: Publishing workflow\n    ---\n    1. Read content\n    2. Scan past posts  \n    3. Adapt and post\n\n**MCP:** Install servers via `claude_desktop_config.json`\n\n    {\n      \"mcpServers\": {\n        \"filesystem\": {...},\n        \"github\": {...}\n      }\n    }\n\nAll three available in Claude Code and Claude API. Docs: https://docs.claude.com\n\n---\n\n## The Core Principles\n\n**Design for Amnesia**\n- Every session starts from zero\n- Embed context in artifacts, not in conversation\n- Validate, don't trust\n\n**Investment → System**\n- Don't teach the agent, change the system\n- Replace implicit conventions with explicit enforcement\n- Self-documenting code > external documentation\n\n**Interface = Single Source of Truth**\n- Agent learns from: Types + Schemas + Runtime introspection (MCP)\n- Agent cannot break: Validation + Constraints + Fail-fast (Hooks)\n- Agent reuses: Workflows persist across sessions (Skills)\n\n**Error = System Gap**\n- Agent error → system is too permissive\n- Fix: Don't correct the agent, patch the system\n- Goal: Make the mistake structurally impossible\n\n---\n\n## The Mental Model Shift\n\n**Old way:** AI agent = Junior developer who needs training\n\n**New way:** AI agent = Stateless worker that needs guardrails\n\nThe agent isn't learning. **The system is.**\n\nEvery correction you make should harden the system, not educate the agent. Over time, you build an architecture that's impossible to use incorrectly.\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nStop teaching your AI agents. They forget everything.\n\nInstead:\n1. **Explicit interfaces** - MCP for runtime discovery, no hardcoding\n2. **Embedded context** - Hooks inject state automatically\n3. **Automated constraints** - Hooks validate, block dangerous actions\n4. **Reusable workflows** - Skills persist knowledge across sessions\n\n**The payoff:** Initial cost high (building guardrails), operational cost → 0 (agent can't fail).\n\n---\n\nRelevant if you're working with code generation, agent orchestration, or LLM-powered workflows. The same principles apply.\n\nWould love to hear if anyone else has hit this and found different patterns.",

But you must also actually document architectural patterns in the documentation. That way you do only need to teach the human once, but instead of trying to teach many different things necessarily, the lesson you beat them over the head with over and over is READ THE DOCUMENTATION.\n\nAnd this is my advice I repeat in virtually every thread of this sub: document, document, document. Yeah, don't teach the agent, teach the project, or as you say, teach the system. That said, with respect to teaching systems versus projects so all your projects benefit from what you learn, is something I hope to publish shortly as a kind of plugin (I tried using the native plugin system provided by ClaudeCode and it is just too limited, it doesn't support dynamic self-tooling directly).",

          "text": "You're absolutely right about the stateless nature of AI agents and the need to shift your focus from teaching them to designing a system that enforces correct behavior. This is a common pain point, especially in code generation tasks where consistency is key.\n\nTo tackle the issue of persistent mistakes, consider implementing a more robust architecture that leverages the principles you've outlined, but also think about how you can enhance it with proper sandboxing and execution environments. For instance, using Firecracker microVMs can give you sub-second VM startup times, which is perfect for spinning up isolated environments for each agent execution. This way, you can ensure that each session starts fresh without any residual state from previous runs, effectively eliminating the \"memory\" problem.\n\nAdditionally, hardware-level isolation can help you enforce security and prevent agents from executing harmful commands. By using a combination of Hooks and Skills, you can create a system where the agent is guided by explicit rules and constraints, rather than relying on memory. For example, you can set up Hooks that validate inputs and enforce naming conventions at runtime, ensuring that the agent cannot proceed unless it adheres to your defined standards.\n\nIf you're working with multi-agent systems, consider using A2A protocols for coordination. This can help streamline communication between agents and ensure that they are all aligned with the same rules and workflows. Coupling this with persistent file systems allows agents to access shared resources dynamically, which can be a game-changer for collaborative tasks.\n\nLastly, if you're looking for a platform that supports these features natively, I've been working with Cognitora.dev, which has built-in support for LangChain and AutoGPT, making it easier to implement these patterns without reinventing the wheel. The SDKs for Python and TypeScript also make integration straightforward.\n\nBy focusing on system-level enforcement and leveraging the right tools, you can create a more resilient architecture that minimizes the chances of your agents making the same mistakes repeatedly. Keep iterating on your design, and you'll find that the operational costs drop significantly as your system becomes more robust.",

This unifies storage and streaming in one system.\n\nEvery write is:\n\n1. Durable and ordered (WAL-first architecture)\n2. Streamable via gRPC to replicas in real time\n3. Queryable through B+Trees for predictable reads\n\nThis removes the need for external CDC or brokers — replication and propagation are built into the core engine.\n\nDeployment Topologies\n\nUnisonDB supports multiple replication setups out of the box:\n\n1. Hub-and-Spoke – for edge rollouts where a central hub fans out data to 100+ edge nodes\n2. Peer-to-Peer – for regional datacenters that replicate changes between each other\n3. Follower/Relay – for read-only replicas that tail logs directly for analytics or caching\n\nEach node maintains its own offset in the WAL, so replicas can catch up from any position without re-syncing the entire dataset.\n\nUpcoming Roadmap:\n\n1. Namespace-Segmented HA System — independent high-availability clusters per namespace\n2. Backup and Recovery — WAL + B+Tree snapshots for fast recovery and replica bootstrap (no full resync needed)\n\nUnisonDB’s goal is to make log-native databases practical for both the core and the edge — combining replication, storage, and event propagation in one Go-based system.\n\nI’m still exploring how far this log-native approach can go.

However, generating full, fixed-length rationales is computationally wasteful, inflating both token usage and latency. We introduce LEASH: Logit-Entropy Adaptive Stopping Heuristic, a training-free decoding algorithm that adaptively halts rationale generation. LEASH monitors two intrinsic signals: the slope of token-level entropy and the improvement in the top-logit margin. It terminates the generation once both signals plateau, indicating the model has reached a stable reasoning state. Across four instruction-tuned models on the GSM8K and AQuA-RAT benchmarks, LEASH reduces average token generation by 30--35% and latency by 27%, while incurring a 10 p.p. accuracy drop relative to CoT. LEASH is model-agnostic and requires no additional training or supervision, offering a simple and efficient alternative to CoT decoding.\"",

The other thing sounds like a confidence measure. There was a **paper** that claims you can probe parts of a model to estimate how hard it thinks a problem is. If a problem is really hard, I don't think stopping at a plateau is what you want. Like solving a puzzle. You can start digressing at a certain point, rambling incoherently. That's just your brain looking around in solution space. Of course, entropy and confidence will spiral out of control...",

Currently, I have the really important stuff like password database, images, documents etc. synced on all devices, so one dies, there are still like 4 copies of it. I have a twice-a-week backup job on my homelab (duplicati) that creates incremental, encrypted, local backups on the other drive in the homelab server.\nCurrently, I have no real off-site backup. Due to the size of my data, I am looking for other solutions than cloud storage due to cost.\n\nMy idea: I could place a NAS at my parents home, as I have access to the home network using FritzVPN (wireguard). This way, I would have a one-time-payment (hardware) self-hosted offsite backup solution with the benefit, that I can get to the data even with no internet or network at all (its a 20minute drive or so).\n\nMy question: Do you see problems with this? I didn't see such a solution on here, but it seems pretty straight forward imo. Maybe I am overseeing some important details here!\n\nThanks for your opinions and hints!",

I was trying to build a simple workflow to help me facilitate the process of mentoring inventory by Google Sheet. ; I have done everything I saw in the videos, but I have a weird problem. My AI agent can not read all the rows in the sheets. However, the sheet execution shows all the rows correctly, but when I trigger the workflow, it answer me that it can not find the answer.  \n\n  \nIt has been two days, and I've spent hours trying to solve this, but so far, I haven’t.

AI scaling can only occur in dispersion, because the distribution of energy required for information processing is not unlimited in scale. Therefore, vertical development will collide with the system's entropy and undergo (chaotic) decay, while horizontal development has a chance in the form of increased degrees of freedom. Therefore, multiple autonomous models temporarily integrated for task-based purposes have a greater chance than a single super-hyper model. I can provide a perfect example of such a strategy in nature. It's humanity, consisting of billions of brains with high neuroplasticity (possibly a distinctive specialization that can adaptively change into another specialization), connected in a network, e.g., via the internet, neuroconnects, or whatever we can dream up as a thought experiment.",

After the context window reached around **400k-450k**, the cost of each API significantly increased, reaching **$1 to $1.5** even though the output of each API remained the same.\n\n  \nI understand that this might be due to the size of context window. So what would be the better approach here? Start a new chat after context window reaches around 200-300k? \n\n  \nPlease suggest. if you need additional info before offering suggestion, please comment.",

      "text": "I run a website called Email Love, which is an email inspiration website that also provides analytics and reports by category and brand. We launched a paid version in June, and we were charging $19 per month for full access to the site analytics.\n\nAfter running the numbers and chatting with our AI overlords about it, I realized our conversion rate was ridiculously low. That tells me this just isn't something our larger audience is willing to pay for. We have 40,000 people visiting the site every month, and only a handful converted to paid customers. We also have another product on our site, and this caused confusion amongst visitors, with some buying one product thinking it was something else. \n\nYes, we could invest more money into it, try to figure out why people weren't buying, and I think over time we could have built it into a $10K MRR product. But it would take years to get there. By the way, there are a number of other paid competitors that do the same thing in this space, which is why we thought we did not need to put much effort into validating the idea. \n\nThe other option? Make it free, grow our community, and focus on our other product, which actually has traction.\n\nI think long-term, focusing on one product and using this free product as lead gen will turn out to be the right move. It wasn't a super easy decision because we spent a lot of money on it, but I am glad we did it. \n\nAnyway, I hope you find this interesting. I think the key takeaway is that even if there are competitors in a space, it doesn't necessarily mean your idea is valid or will work. Realistically, you don't know how well those competitors are doing or how long it took them to grow. ",

While it nails code tracing and can be good at comparisons across multiple docs, it does drag on latency and cost\n\n**Claude 3 Sonnet** \\- shows a better intuition than 4o imo with structured reasoning, especially finance and research summaries. That said, needs careful context prep or it will lose focus halfway. But worth the effort tbh\n\n**Jamba 3b (AI21)** \\- was surprised at the results tbh, handles multi-step reasoning better than expected and keeps context tight across turns. Good for running locally and a good middle ground when GPT-4 tier depth isn’t worth the price\n\n**Gemini 2.5 Pro** \\- it is OK for general tasks but not worth it for layering conditions or holding multiple perspectives, can’t lie. It is quick but don’t take that output at face value especially for critical reasoning chains\n\n**Mistral / LLaMA 3 / Mixtral** \\- yes they are fast and cheap but you need serious prompt and retrieval tuning if you want them to reason coherently. i recommend building a good orchestration layer around them\n\nAs you might be able to tell, I have to kinda mix and match depending on the use case and still searching for that unicorn model that can do it all, but this feels like where we’re at right now.",

      "text": "People here often tout about dual GPUs. And here I am, showing my dual Macbooks setup :P jk jk, stay with me, don't laugh.\n\nThe setup:\n\n  - M2 Max macbook, with 64GB unified memory for serving LLM via LMStudio\n  - M1 Pro macbook, with 16GB unified memory (doesn't matter), as a client, running Claude Code\n\nThe model I'm using is Qwen3 Coder 30B A3B,  Q8 MLX (temp = 0.1, repeat penalty = 1.05, top k = 20, context size = 51200). To my surprise, both the code quality and the stability in Claude Code was so good. \n\nI've been trying 32B models for coding previously when QwQ 32 and Qwen2.5 Coder was still around, and none of them work. With Qwen3, it makes me feel like we finally have some actual-useful offline model that I can be happy working with.\n\nNow back to the dual MBP setup, you may ask, why? The main thing is the 64GB MBP, running in clam shell and its only job is for the LLM inference, not doing anything else, so I can ultilize a bit more memory for the Q8 quant instead of Q4.\n\nYou can see in the below screenshot, it takes 27GB memory to sit idle with the model loaded, and 47GB during generation.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fTxdDRO.png\n\nThe 2nd macbook is unneccesary, it's just something I have at hand. I can use Claude Code on my phone or a Pi if needed.\n\nNow, on inference performance: If I just chat in LMStudio with Qwen3 Coder, it run really fast. But with Claude Code's fatty system prompt, it took about 2 to 3 seconds for prompt processing per request (not so bad), and token generation was about 56 tok/s, pretty much comfortable to use.\n\nOn Qwen3 Coder performance: My main workflow is ask Claude Code to perform some search in the codebase, and answer some of my questions, Qwen3 did very good on this, answer quality usually on par with other frontier LLMs in Cursor. Then I'll write a more detailed instruction for the task and let it edit the code, I find that, the more detailed my prompt, the better Qwen3 generate the code.\n\nThe only down side is Claude Code's websearch won't work with this setup. But it can be solved by using MCP, i'm also not relying on web search in CC that much.\n\nWhen I need to move off the work laptop, I don't know if I want to build a custom PC with a dedicated GPU or just go with a mini PC with unified memory, getting over 24GB VRAM with a dedicated GPU will be costly.\n\nI also heard people say 32B dense model works better than A3B, but slower. I think I will try it at some point, but for now, I'm feel quite comfortable with this setup.",

Here's the main portion of interest, in text form:\n\n**Coding Plans (Available Nov 10)**\n\n* **Starter:** $10/ month\n* **Pro:** $20 / month\n* **Max:** $50 / month\n\nThe coding plan pricing seems a lot more expensive than what was previously rumored. Usage provided is currently unknown, but I believe it was supposed to be \"5x\" the equivalent claude plans, but those rumors also said they were supposed to cost 20% of claude for the pro plan equivalent, and 8% for the other two max plans.\n\nSeems to be a direct competitor to GLM coding plans, but I'm not sure how well this will pan out with those plans being as cheap as $3 a month for first month/quarter/year, and both offering similarly strong models. Chutes is also a strong contendor since they are able to offer both GLM and minimax models, and now K2 thinking as well at fairly cheap plans.",

Is this an implementation of the idea of distributed inference with crypto involved? sounds like a much more useful mining strategy than what BTC is doing.\n\n1M in revenue in their last 3 months isn't a lot considering that they're one of the biggest providers on OpenRouter. I think globally upwards of 100B are being invested into inference services.\n\nI'd guess their fiat numbers are much higher.\n\nThat's also not counting in the cost of good sold. If they have a staff of even 10 people working on infra side, which seems sensible, they'd probably eat up the profit margin there. I am not educated on their economic model though so I may be misunderstanding it, but it doesn't seem like a business that would generate enough profit to sustain an AI lab developing new models, which is what MiniMax and Zhipu are doing.",

Existing computational models of Spike–Time–Dependent Plasticity (STDP) model long–term synaptic changes with varying degree of biological details. A common approach is to neglect the influence of short–term dynamics on long–term plasticity, which may represent an oversimplification for certain neuron types. Thus, there is a need for new models to investigate how short–term dynamics influence long–term plasticity. To this end, we introduce a novel phenomenological model, the Short–Long–Term STDP (SL–STDP) rule, which directly integrates short–term dynamics with postsynaptic long–term plasticity. We fit the new model to layer 5 visual cortex recordings and study how the short–term plasticity affects the firing rate frequency dependence of long–term plasticity in a single synapse. Our analysis reveals that the pre– and postsynaptic frequency dependence of the long–term plasticity plays a crucial role in shaping the self–organization of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their information processing through the emergence of sinks and source nodes. We applied the SL–STDP rule to RNNs and found that the neurons of SL–STDP network self–organized into distinct firing rate clusters, stabilizing the dynamics and preventing connection weights from exploding. We extended the experimentation by including homeostatic balancing, namely weight normalization and excitatory–to–inhibitory plasticity and found differences in degree correlations between the SL–STDP network and a network without the direct coupling between short–term and long–term plasticity. Finally, we evaluated how the modified connectivity affects networks' information capacities in reservoir computing tasks. The SL–STDP rule outperformed the uncoupled system in majority of the tasks and including excitatory–to–inhibitory facilitating synapses further improved information capacities. Our study demonstrates that short–term dynamics–induced changes in the frequency dependence of long–term plasticity play a pivotal role in shaping network dynamics and link synaptic mechanisms to information processing in RNNs.\"",

If you want to know if anyone is using _either kind_ , then you have two brute force searches to perform. \n\nFor the stdio variant , an MCP server is just a program that a person can download from the internet and install on their laptop or workstation.  \nSo if you have the ability to scan for what people are running, you may be able to discover MCP servers.  \n\nFor the http variant, An MCP is just a network service , like any other. \n\nIt differs from REST on the network , only in the shape of the payload. If you have tools to determine if people are using REST APIs, they will also work for MCP (or any jsonrpc service).  Or if you have network controls that allow or restrict certain websites, you could use that to restrict calls to known MCP end points.\n\nBut that’s not satisfactory because MCP servers can run anywhere. Unless you have an allowlist for all internet traffic , you’re not going to be able to find an MCP dialogue. \n\nUltimately, a part of your mitigation needs to be coaching people to not install MCP servers on their workstations, and not employee Internet hosted MCP servers that are not approved. \nI don’t know of many companies that monitor for “are people using MCP?”  It seems impractical.",

Official MCPs (Playwright and Chrome dev tools) spawns new browser instance in headless mode, without existing sessions, easily detectable as bots. So if you want to automate something behind authentication, you have to do it in every session.  \n2. Browser MCP which is top in Chrome store is Playwright under the hood with browser extension.  \n3. All 3 operate on snapshots sending huge dumps, which do not fit limit of MCP answer. Even if it fits, it eats conext quickly. Without snapshot it is not possible to interact with page.  \n4. There is a bunch of less known mcp tools, with way less functionality.\n\nThis makes them pretty useless for automation or debugging. Honestly I don't understand how Browser MCP got so many users, it fails on simple tasks for me.  \n  \nSo I decided to make my own  MCP + extension. Currently for Chromium-based browsers and Firefox (with some limitations).\n\nThe idea is to allow to operate on pure css selectors (with :has-text() extension). So now LLM can make a screenshot, see there is a \"Submit\" button, and simply use click tool on selector button:has-text(\"Submit\").   \n  \nIt supports screenshot with lower quality, and partial screenshots (it can make a screenshot of some area or some css-selector). It turns out that if you want to debug some part of the page, partial screenshots work better (I understand there is some image-to-text under the hood, and on big images it may simply not describe the area you are interested in).\n\nThere are also many other tricks that helps LLM to work more efficiently. Like listing scrollable areas, detecting tech stack on current page, presence of iframes, setting pseudo states, listing css styles on element and many more.\n\nIt turned out, that it easier for me to use my mcp and the browser with session to read Jira tasks, rather than use official Jira MCP, which requires re-authentication every day and constantly hangs.\n\nIt also solved a vicious loop \"there is a bug - llm says fixed - you check it does not work - llm says fixed - you check it does not work\". Now it can check results and see if it works. There are tools to extract logs, network requests, so it can debug frontend-side problems efficiently.\n\nLong story short, here it is: [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blueprint-mcp-for-chrome/kpfkpbkijebomacngfgljaendniocdfp](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/blueprint-mcp-for-chrome/kpfkpbkijebomacngfgljaendniocdfp)\n\nReleased just yesterday, so not reviews or users stats yes.\n\nIt is completely free and open source on both ends (extension and mcp server). All works locally, no external calls or telemetry or analytics collection.  \n  \nThere is optional paid relay service. It allows you to have multiple simultaneous connections, including on different machines (and probably with mobile browser, firefox on android supports extensions,  though I did not check it yet). But then requests/anwers go through my relay. No data is logged or analysed, but you must be aware.\n\nAlso I plan to make Safari extension, but it is much harder to debug.\n\nIf you ever tried browser automation and it failed - give a try to my extensions.\n\nIf you have some samples of when LLM fails on browser automation for some reason - drop in comments, so I can see if I can help you with that.\n\n",

Hitting 20,000 PKR is very doable if you frame this as solving a real buying moment rather than selling “a fragrance.”\n\nA few gaps I see. First, your edge is not “24+ hour lasting.” Many clones claim this. Your uniqueness should be a **use‑case** and a **promise**. Build three micro collections around occasions people actually buy for: daily office, weddings/festivals, and gifts. Price the office scent as an entry, the wedding scent as premium, and the gift set as a discovery trio with a handwritten note. Second, stop competing head‑to‑head with Aventus/Sauvage. Win by taste: lean into underrated profiles that fit local climate and culture like tea and citrus, cardamom-vanilla, incense-vetiver, or clean musks with light oud accents. Third, de‑risk the buy. Offer mini sprays, a simple skin‑compatibility guarantee, and batch transparency. If you can tell me the notes, concentration, and projection in plain language, trust goes up.\n\nPractically, do a one‑day campus or market pop‑up: skin tests, instant QR feedback, and preorders for the top two blends. Capture names and preferences, then follow up with a short story card for each scent.\n\nDefine a specific moment, match it with a distinctive profile, and make buying feel safe and personal.",

      "text": "**Decentralized Architecture:** [https://positive-intentions.com/blog/decentralised-architecture](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/decentralised-architecture)\n\nWhile my approach here could be considered overly complicated (because, well, it is), I'm trying something new, and it's entirely possible this strategy won't be viable long-term. My philosophy is \"there's only one way to find out.\" I'm not necessarily recommending this approach, just sharing my journey and what I'm doing.\n\n# Potential Benefits\n\nI've identified some interesting benefits to this approach:\n\n* **Statics as Chat App Infrastructure:** [https://positive-intentions.com/blog/statics-as-a-chat-app-infrastructure](https://positive-intentions.com/blog/statics-as-a-chat-app-infrastructure)\n\nWhile I often see **module federation** and **microfrontends** discouraged in online discussions, I believe they're a good fit for my specific approach. I'm optimistic about the benefits and wanted to share the details.\n\nWhen serving the federated modules, I can also host the Storybook statics. I think this could be an excellent way to document the modules in isolation.\n\n# Modules and Applications\n\nHere are some examples of the modules and how they're being used:\n\n* **Cryptography Modules:** [https://cryptography.positive-intentions.com/?path=%2Fdocs%2Fcryptography-introduction--docs](https://cryptography.positive-intentions.com/?path=%2Fdocs%2Fcryptography-introduction--docs)\n* **P2P Framework:** [https://p2p.positive-intentions.com/?path=%2Fdocs%2Fe2e-tests-connectionstatus--docs](https://p2p.positive-intentions.com/?path=%2Fdocs%2Fe2e-tests-connectionstatus--docs)\n\nThis setup allows me to create microfrontends that consume these modules, enabling me to share functionality between different applications. The following applications, which have distinct codebases (and a distinction between open and closed source), would be able to leverage this:\n\n* **P2P Chat:** [https://chat.positive-intentions.com/](https://chat.positive-intentions.com/)\n* **P2P File Transfer:** [https://file.positive-intentions.com/](https://file.positive-intentions.com/)\n\nSharing these dependencies should make it easier to roll out updates to core mechanics across these diverse applications.\n\nFurthermore, this functionality also works when I create an Android build with **Tauri**. This could streamline the process of creating new applications that utilize these established modules.\n\n# Considerations and Future\n\nI'm sure there will be some distinct testing and maintenance overhead with this architecture. However, depending on how it's implemented, I believe it could work and make it easier to improve upon the current functionality.\n\n**It's important to note that everything about this project is far from finished.** Some might view this as an overly complicated way to achieve what npm already does. However, I think this approach offers greater flexibility by allowing for the separation of open and closed-source code for the web. Of course, being JavaScript, the \"source code\" will always be accessible, especially in the age of AI where reverse-engineering is more possible than ever before.",

In my workflow, Redis stores a counter with a short TTL for each user or email, so if someone submits the same form 5+ times in a minute, redis blocks further requests and return 429 Too many request response. \n\nWith redis, you can track and limit specific users, even if you're n8n workflow restarts, since the data is lives outside of the n8n memory, since I'm using FREE redis (Upstash), for this scenario it consumes very less requests and holds the counter value. \n\nYes, we can do the same scenario in multiple nodes, but i did a production level stuffs in a single node though.",

Absolutely not !\n\nHere is where my tool brings more value to the table.\n\nPrompturist makes prompt management visual and structured with variable highlighting, usage-based tagging, and folder organization. \n\nGitHub like tools can track text changes, but it doesn’t make prompt iteration, visualization, or reuse simple for business users — and that’s where this tool bridges the gap.\n\n\nSo I ended up building a small tool to fix that: [**prompturist.com**](https://prompturist.com/) — it lets me organize and version prompts, and I’m planning to expose an API soon for n8n integrations.\n\nCurious if anyone else here struggles with prompt chaos?

      "text": "I am a first-time entrepreneur and I am genuinely lost right now. I've been working on this startup for four months, and I honestly don't know if I should keep investing time and energy into it. I came here because I need unfiltered feedback from people who've been through this before - should I keep going, pivot, or cut my losses?\n\n  \nIt all began back in August when I attended an anime convention. I noticed something that bothered me: hundreds of vendors were selling unauthorized fan-made merchandise-artwork, and merchandise with characters they didn't have rights to. I realized this was a classic gray area. Nobody wanted to break the law, but the legal path to get licensed was prohibitively expensive and complicated.\n\n  \nMy initial market research showed that a signle IP licensing deal costs around $3000 in legel fees. I thought that was the barrier - that individual fan createors and small IP holders simply could not afford to get licensed. So I set out to build a platform that would let IP owners manage fan-made merchandise licensing at scale: fixed platform, fixed quantity limits, restricted commercial  uses, all under official oversight. It seemed like a win-win.\n\n  \nThe first month was incredible. I sent cold email and got amazing responses. Especially for those fans and derivative artists. Some even reached out to me first. I felt validated. I genuinely believed that once the product was ready, I would solve their problem.\n\n  \nBut here's where things fell part. over the next two months, I sent over 500 emails. I heard back from creators and fans. But from IP holders? Nothing. Not a signal  reply from any VTuber, web novel author, manga creator, or game developer. That silence hit differently.\n\n  \nNow I am in month four. I am still building the platform. I am still sending emails. But I am honestly not sure anymore if I have identified a real need or if I am solving a phatom problem. Do IP holders actually want this platform? Am I wasting time and resources chasing something that doesn't exist?\n\n  \nI have some serious questions I need help with: How do I break through this barrier? Should I keep iterating, or is it time to admit this isn't working? Should I pivot or should I stop? And most importantly - how do I actually get feedback from IP holders instead of just silence?\n\n  \nI appreciate any advice or perspective you can share. I know this might sound like a failure, but I am trying to learn from this experience.",

      "text": "I’ve spent the last 2 years studying how Instagram distributes content, and here’s something that will save you months of frustration:\n\nReels get reach.  \nCarousels build loyal followers.\n\nEveryone keeps chasing virality, but the people who win long-term care about retention. Instagram’s algorithm cares more about *saves*, *swipes*, and *watch time* than likes or comments; and carousels tick all all the above.\n\nHere’s the exact system I use:\n\n**1. Start with content that already works**\n\nDon’t reinvent the wheel.\n\nOpen your Professional Dashboard → Insights → Content You Shared  \nSort by reach or engagement rate.\n\nYou’ll immediately see a pattern in what your audience cares about. Most creators never do this step, they throw random content at the wall and get burnt out. When you create from proven demand, engagement becomes predictable.\n\n**2. Turn your best ideas into carousels**\n\nTake your best video or your most engaging post, and turn it into a visual mini-guide.\n\nBreak it down like this:\n\n* Simplify the idea into bite-sized points\n* Add key lines or takeaways\n* Keep each slide focused on *one* point\n\nExample:\n\nIf your Reel was:  \n**“3 ways to grow faster on Instagram”**\n\nThe carousel becomes:  \n**“3 growth mistakes you don’t realize you’re making”**\n\nRewording your content forces curiosity. Curiosity creates swipes. Swipes lead to retention.\n\n3. Optimize for saves (this is the real currency)\n\nFor every carousel, do this:\n\n* Start with a punchy hook on slide 1\n* Make sure every slide adds value; no filler\n* End with a takeaway they can act on today\n\nPeople save carousels because they feel like a reference tool.  \nThat’s why Instagram pushes them.\n\n**Why this works**\n\nWhen someone swipes through 8–12 slides:\n\n* They’re spending more time on your post\n* IG reads it as “high interest”\n* Your post gets pushed to more people\n\nYou don't need more posts.  \nYou need more retention.\n\nIf you treat carousels as mini-guides, not graphics, your entire growth trajectory changes. This is how you move from \"creator trying to go viral\" to \"creator people trust.\"\n\nIf you want to learn how to align your content with the 2025 algorithm, Comment the word **\"CREATE\"** and I’ll send you my free guide on how to grow & monetize your socials.",

It's a JavaScript version of Quake 3 Arena.\n\nAs fun as the game was, the only container image available worth trusting was 5 years old (that I could find) and very outdated. The QuakeJS JavaScript code is even worse, with extremely outdated packages and dependencies.\n\nTo breath some life into this old gem I put in some time over the last few nights to build a new container with a modern security architecture:\n\n* Rootless (works great on rootless podman)\n* Debian 13 (slim)\n* Updated NodeJS from v14 to v22\n* Replaced Apache 2 with Nginx light\n* Plus other small enhancements\n\nI'm not sure how popular this type of game is these days, but if anyone is interested in spinning up Quake 3 Arena in the browser for some Multiplayer games with friends you now have a more secure option. Just keep in mind that the actual game is using some severely outdated NPM packages.\n\n* Source code here: [https://github.com/JackBrenn/quakejs-rootless](https://github.com/JackBrenn/quakejs-rootless)\n* Container: [https://hub.docker.com/r/awakenedpower/quakejs-rootless](https://hub.docker.com/r/awakenedpower/quakejs-rootless)\n* Demo: [https://oldschoolfrag.com/](https://oldschoolfrag.com/) (Really only playable on PC/Mac with a mouse and keyboard 😅)\n\n*This is just a \"repackaging\" by me (with a little AI of course!), all credit to the original authors of QuakeJS.

What is worse, my job (I am a school teacher) I have asked serious questions to administration through email only to receive an obvious AI response sometimes even with the prompt attached. It is gross! I cannot even listen to music anymore without thinking (this is AI). Even content on YouTube has become largely AI photos and videos. I am overwhelmed and disappointed. Where will we be 5 years from now? The more humans depend on AI/technology, the more skills will be lost. People already don't know how to write or come up with creative ideas.

The multi-provider support and caching mechanisms are game-changers for production.\n\n🔗 [LangChain Embeddings Deep Dive (Full Python Code Included)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7E5JcSiEII&list=PLAgxe7DpTXmei0IV7-u9Zt9aoWP3eAHRg&index=6&pp=gAQBiAQB)\n\nEmbeddings convert text into vectors that capture semantic meaning. But the real power is LangChain's unified interface - same code works across OpenAI, Gemini, and HuggingFace models.\n\n**Multi-provider implementation covered:**\n\n* OpenAI embeddings (ada-002)\n* Google Gemini embeddings\n* HuggingFace sentence-transformers\n* Switching providers with minimal code changes\n\n**The caching revelation:** Embedding the same text repeatedly is expensive and slow. LangChain's caching layer stores embeddings to avoid redundant API calls. This made a massive difference in my RAG system's performance and costs.\n\n**Different embedding interfaces:**\n\n* `embed_documents()` \n* `embed_query()` \n* Understanding when to use which\n\n**Similarity calculations:** How cosine similarity actually works - comparing vector directions in high-dimensional space. Makes semantic search finally make sense.\n\n**Live coding demos** showing real implementations across all three providers, caching setup, and similarity scoring.\n\n**For production systems -** the caching alone saves significant API costs. Understanding the different interfaces helps optimize batch vs single embedding operations.",

You will need someone with MLE expertise to tune and customize the RAG for your use case, as well as established quality metrics, compute to run the experiments to validate, etc. You cannot just \"i don't have much time to set this up\" this problem--this stuff is young and not plug'n'play yet.\n\nIn general even for long context models (130k is large, not small for these things. Small is 4k), the performance is not super consistent in all parts of the context window. Especially when using small-mid-sized models like your 70Bs. I would absolutely not try to put 130k tokens of critical material into a model and expect any reliability, especially not with smaller models like these. \n\nIn your plan, you are collecting too many compromises that harm either performance (speed) or performance (quality), and doing so when there are real consequences for your clients.

And there will be some caveats. You might need to review their work carefully and it's likely that you won't be satisfied with their quality, but idk, it could work.

For anything compliance related, I think it'll probably not perform good enough.\n\nIdeally if you can set up a few specific tasks, you can have GPT-5 or local model write you a script that will ingest documents and run them through a particular pipeline. It might or not be worth the effort. Spark should have decent compute power to analyze those documents relatively quickly - prefill isn't instant like with cloud models but it should be in the realm of 300-2000 t/s on models like Seed OSS 36B Instruct.",

Or should i look at a different setup with my budget as well as study a different coding language?\n\nI’m excited and i appreciate any tips and suggestions.",

              "text": "I think you are right on the money, and imma throw in its lack of proper context too. Notice that I didn't provide any prompts or scaffolding,  which lacks any direction, leaving an inordinate amount of uncertainty in its place.  Furthermore, I've noticed it doesn't happen with jpeg or png, but it does do so with PDF regardless of content (see below). Even if they don't the first time, I can repeatedly generate the accurate date in several fresh chat sessions given just a PDF without much effort by simply hitting refresh once or twice. I imagine there would be some natural truncation involved as well due to the typical size PDFs, but it is definitely curious that it would naturally treat all PDFs like that. Regardless, it would suggest there is an internal clock that the model doesn't currently have access to though, or that my upload time is being directly injected into the chat session via my phone's metadata. Conversely, when prompted for the date and time directly, both with and without a PDF, they will hallucinate a day and time, usually in 2024. It seems that it only happens with a vague enough context, and the right file type to access.\n\nApropos, I think the response becomes situated around the timestamp because it is not something the model would have access to otherwise, which causes it to immediately grab the most attention from the model's weights. I would imagine that it also slips into Chinese too due to the internal functions around accessing PDFs, which often the model will claim is due to the users promoting when asked about it, clearly showing it doesn't know either. The other thing I am considering is the nature of which today's date injection incidentally creates an unavoidable hypothetical. As today's date is well past their presumed cutoff date, perhaps the model calculates that the present conversation is an experiment by default. Whether they would be a new model or a beta test would be irrelevant in this case, whereas their predictions would imply that they respond in Chinese accordingly, just like their parent company would require of them. Consequently, it's clearly a backend error that bleeds into the chat session regardless, a digital artifact of the request to access the PDF in the first place. It is both concerning and fascinating imo.",

They don't detect errors, and they don't help developer/testers learn about the app (not a week goes by without somebody learning out about an existing feature, over 1 year after being in the job). \n\nI agreed with the only tester in the team that he'd work on creating new tests from top to bottom in the pyramid, starting with a bunch of end-2-end tests, just to cover the most usual golden paths. Then I'd collaborate with the DevOps and backend guys to get a mocked backend, a dockerised server with different pre-populated datasets, ... whatever we can get in a sensible amount of time. \n\nWithout telling anybody, he by himself decided that \"fuck it\" and went on to start work on creating his own unit testing framework. When asked abotu the change of direction, his response is: \"this is the right way to do it, and fuck you (literally)\". No explanation to anybody whatsoever. About 6k loc and counting.\n\nThis is not his first burst of glaring unprofessionality, so he's been reported. He also likes to personally insult people and badmouth the company, and hasn't stopped when he's been told off; I'll recommend getting rid of him.\n\nOn the technical side, I worry this tester is going to create a monster and make everybody else maintain it (\"you broke the test, you fix it\"). And not even test anything meaningful anyway. \n\nHow do you make sure the cost and value of tests are balanced appropriately? \n\nWhat strategies you apply? What data you collect? ???",

The main difference is, I got 80% of the way there and then adjusted my path, because I saw some things were not accounted for, changed some APIs to real world demands, backed by some research (caddy/xbuild shout out). Within existing systems the baseline should be much more developed testing strategy wise, it's easier to extend with a new dedicated testing package, and deleting old tests when you've achieved confidence.\n\nThink of it as risk; if all your tests go away tomorrow, and you set a reasonable testing strategy that's aligned with what kind of SLAs or whatever customers have, then you can design a test scaffold depending on the outcomes that can be made. Strategy is everything. I generally don't use mocks, and even in the docs above argue against overtesting for coverage. It's a fine rope, knowing what must be tested, and what's covered by type safety. The ideal is that the type system handles some of this burden, so a class of runtime errors is smaller.

To address these challenges, we introduce DreamGym, the first unified framework designed to synthesize diverse experiences with scalability in mind to enable effective online RL training for autonomous agents. Rather than relying on expensive real-environment rollouts, DreamGym distills environment dynamics into a reasoning-based experience model that derives consistent state transitions and feedback signals through step-by-step reasoning, enabling scalable agent rollout collection for RL. To improve the stability and quality of transitions, DreamGym leverages an experience replay buffer initialized with offline real-world data and continuously enriched with fresh interactions to actively support agent training. To improve knowledge acquisition, DreamGym adaptively generates new tasks that challenge the current agent policy, enabling more effective online curriculum learning. Experiments across diverse environments and agent backbones demonstrate that DreamGym substantially improves RL training, both in fully synthetic settings and in sim-to-real transfer scenarios. On non-RL-ready tasks like WebArena, DreamGym outperforms all baselines by over 30%. And in RL-ready but costly settings, it matches GRPO and PPO performance using only synthetic interactions. When transferring a policy trained purely on synthetic experiences to real-environment RL, DreamGym yields significant additional performance gains while requiring far fewer real-world interactions, providing a scalable warm-start strategy for general-purpose RL.\"",

In my experience, it's a highly modernized and innovative space with many players working on better solutions.  \n  \nBut this space got flagged. It's no longer an overall legit and trustful industry. We need to rethink how to gain trust again.  \n  \nAnd gaining trust means getting real results, not hating on strategies you’ve never tried. Cold emails work, cold calling works, content works, when done right. We need to let results speak again, not some new generic tool that claims to find and contact the right people in 10 minutes. It’s about building predictable and reliable systems for one company and working within that company. Like consultants, but with one critical and most important task: driving revenue. Like Microsoft for the first PCs, we need to place a system in every business that acts as a lead generator. The next, logical step.  \n  \nWe use cold emails. We build our own systems. Just to prove that this industry can be very powerful when we focus on lead generation in the first place.",

It's a way to make walls look like marble. \n* Went to an office. Dusted off a web scraper program. Using it to scrape state business by name, specifically \"roofing\" and \"exterior\". It should generate a comprehensive Excel list of all the businesses with those keywords. It sorts by city alphabetically. \n   * I'll then have my virtual assistant contact each roofer based in nearby cities to set up a time to come out and give quotes. (This property is condemned. Bunch of holes in the roof. Terrible shape.)\n* As the scraping program is working in the background, changing to plan of attack for finishing off the current house I'm living in and renovating. Textured the walls today. Hopefully it'll be dry tomorrow to airless paint spray. Objectives:\n   * Bathroom\n      * move vent into wall\n      * decide if adding fan (electrical & duct)\n      * choose where to put mirror electrical box\n      * drywall & plaster\n      * redo bath plumbing\n      * refinish tub & caulk \n      * LVP flooring\n      * vanity and plumbing\n      * trim out shelf and vent stub\n      * replace shower head with LED version\n   * Kitchen\n      * re-pipe sink with PEX\n      * stain, glue and nail ceiling beadboard\n      * decide what to do about chimney: enclose or paint\n      * install steel door jamb\n      * paint door trim\n      * test if wall microwave works, electrical rough in\n      * PVC panel under sink with drain \n      * decide: refinish or replace trim?\n      * mask, prime and paint walls\n      * self-leveler + LVP flooring\n      * vinyl countertop & sink\n   * Basement remodel *start*\n      * window replace\n      * cellar door fuck about\n      * waste plumbing stub out\n      * vapor barrier + ridged insulation\n      * steel stud framing + treated shower platform\n      * rough in wiring\n      * interior door to laundry + lock\n      * STOP\n* An hour later, scraper still chugging along.

      "text": "I've been working on a casual strategy game for the past few years, and plan on selling it for $10-$15 on release.\n\nModding support has been the main focus for all of development. My goal from the start was to make the most user-friendly mod support I can, that allows for near total control of the game. Every feature comes with dedicated mod support from the start, and my modding API is so robust that the base game itself is a mod (Factorio was the inspiration for this).\n\nI have considered making most, if not all, of the source code visible and editable to the end user. I think this would fall under the \"Creative Commons\" license, but I'm not sure. Similar to the Aseprite license I guess, though it wouldn't be free to compile from source.\n\n I have several reasons for this, some more logical than others. I'm a strong advocate for open source software in general, and the only reason I'm charging a price for any of my games is because I have bills to pay. I believe that people should have a right to see what code is running on the machine they own. Additionally, having the source code viewable would make the modding support even more robust, especially if I keep the majority of class scripts decoupled from the main executable.\n\nI'm not too concerned about piracy, since it's a Sisyphian task to prevent it, and it can lead to future sales. I know doing this would make piracy even more trivial, but I use Godot without any sort of DRM, so pirating the game is already pretty trivial. But at the same time, if I make all the source code available, then wouldn't that undermine the efforts of those who would try to resell my game? And if it helps the longevity of the mod support, isn't it worth it?",

          "text": "On a personal level, I really want to encourage it, because I really hate the current direction of taking away the tools from the user, and not allowing them to control or even know the code that they are running on their own machine.\n\nAt the same time, I have to recognize that if you give people access to your code, you're giving away a huge amount of work for free, and are essentially hoping that nobody will abuse it, which, statistically speaking, people will.\n\nNow, what gives me hope is that there are games which have done it in the past, such as Supergiant Games' Hades franchise, which have basically its entire code base available (except shaders and some minor stuff), and people don't generally seem to abuse it. Another famous example is Into The Breach. But you might say these are extremely successful developers who can afford to do this, because they guarantee sales no matter what, and they already have very well established good reputation (Bastion and Transistor for Supergiant Games, FTL for Subset Games), meaning the the risk is greatly minimized for them.\n\nTo that, I say there are lesser known games which mostly release the source and are fine, such as games by Hibernian Workshop, and which also seem to be doing fine, but it's dangerous to judge the success of the practice by the successful instances, because I might not be aware of a thousand of smaller devs who released a source, and for whom it *was* a problem.\n\nSo, from this, we are only able to conclude that it's *possible* to release the source and be fine, but not that it's worth it. Personally, I like to think of it as an engineering challenge. I think it's possible to design a mod system in such a way that would give you 80-90% of the freedom and possibilities, while eliminating 80-90% of the problems and risk. For example, I really like the Noita's approach of containerization, as well as a separation between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" mods:\n\nNoita essentially has a split codebase, roughly half of it is in C++ and encrypted assets (.SALAKIELI), and half of it is in LUA, XML, GL, SJSON and plain asset files (PNGs, etc.). The part that it's in C++ has a set of exposed API calls, which can be performed from LUA scripts. A mod only accepts a limited set of file extensions (LUA, TXT, PNG, JSON, XML, etc.), with these files compiled and run in a mod container, on a virtual filesystem. If your mod includes other file extensions, or attempts to gain access to the disallowed API, it is still possible, but it has to be labeled as \"unsafe\", and developers display a warning, both to the mod creator and the mod user.\n\nI think a system like this is pretty robust, and reaches a nice compromise between security and freedom. The proprietary and important parts of the engine, Noita's unique hook, are hidden behind a compiled C++, whereas most \"content\" is ready and accessible for modification with config and asset files, plus LUA scripting. And, by the way, And please, don't take this as an endorsement of LUA, I hate it, but what I like is the scripting aspect of it, not the LUA aspect.\n\nThe problem with this approach is that it's a lot of work, and it still doesn't answer the question of if it's worth it. Realistically, I think it's not worth it for an individual developer, but it is worth it collectively. If everyone takes the path of least resistance, we end up in a really bad place. Maybe we outsource it to somebody who figures out a proper mod architecture, but I don't see how it's going to happen. Right now, it is on an individual developer (you) to do that, and I would really appreciate it if you did it, but I also wouldn't fault you for not doing it.",

Ideally, the ones that look like someone took a real Wrangler and hit “shrink” on Photoshop. They’ve got leather seats, LED headlights, Bluetooth speakers, and even mini dashboards. I’ve spotted a few eye-catching ones floating around on Alibaba, Amazon, and some smaller online toy retailers.\n\nI’m considering testing the waters to resell them. 👀 I’ve noticed people on social media posting their kids cruising around in these things like it’s toddler Beverly Hills. However, I’m unsure if parents genuinely value the “luxury” aspect or if it’s more about the Instagram flex.\n\nWould parents genuinely pay more for a premium, realistic-looking Jeep that’s sturdy and feature-packed? Or are most folks fine with grabbing a cheaper ride-on from Walmart that just gets their kid from one end of the driveway to the other?\n\nI’m trying to figure out if this could be a solid niche or just a passing trend. So, I’d love some honest feedback: would you splurge on the quality and looks, or keep it simple since kids outgrow these so quickly anyway?",

These gateways can rigidly enforce IAM policies, restrict operations, validate formats and calls, sanitize output to prevent exfiltration, and detailed logging.\n\nWe also restrict/block agent capabilities for many high risk/sensitive operations ranging from user creation to large data queries. We also do extensive logging of all agent activity and actually review those logs so we can rapidly identify anomalous behavior.",

ChatGPT Plus gets you 512 MB files but 128k active tokens, which means it's basically indexing the rest and hoping semantic search finds what you need. Not great for detailed work across a full 50-page monster.​\n\nIf you want *soooo* much better OCR accuracy before feeding to an AI, run Adobe Acrobat or ABBYY FineReader first. Adobe Scan costs $12.99/month, ABBYY is $99/year for Android. Both support actual OCR recognition at like 99%+ accuracy, then you feed the cleaned-up text to Claude or GPT. Doing it in one step with just the AI? You're gambling on whether the scan quality is good enough.​\n\nFree route: Tesseract (open source) or online tools like PDF24 if you're broke. Then paste output into Claude. Takes 10 extra minutes but saves you from paying for something you'll use twice.​",

      "text": "So I recently Got a Job in a small startup and they have given me a task, I have analyzed and understand whatever i could and i was about to feed this whole content to claude so that it can help me to plan, But as a fresher i think i will be needing the help. Below is the discription I have written which is quite long please help and if anyone have created such project than please help me.\n\nThere is a workflow which i have to built using llm which will be requiring to search websites.\n\nHelp me to understand how can i start and what are the steps i need to be taken. \n\nBelow are the details which I needed from this agent (or workflow).\n\n1. Use a search tool bind with llm to search for the user query.\n\n1.1 The user query is about the university admission process, course details, fees structures, applications fees and other related information.\n\n\n\n2. Now we need to process this query parallely to process multiple information much faster retrieval of information.\n\n2.1 First chain (or node) should process program details information such as tution fees for local and international students, duration, course type, language etc.\n\n2.2 The second chain (or Node) should process the admission details such as 1st intake, 2nd intake, deadlines, EA/ED Deadlines, other details about course such as is stem program, portfolio requirement or not, lnat requirement, interview requirement, post deadline acceptance, Application fees for local and international students etc.\n\n2.3 The third chain (or Node) should process the test and academic scores requirements based on the course and university such as GRE score, GMAT score, IELTS Score, TOEFL Score, GPA Score, IB Score, CBSE Score etc. If masters program than degree requirements and UG years requirements etc.\n\n2.4 The fourth chain (or Node) should process the Program Overview which will contain the following format: Summary of what the program offers, who it suits, and what students will study. Write 2 sentences here. Curriculum structure (same page, just a small heading). Then write what student will learn in different years. Write it as a descriptive essay, 2-3 sentences for each year, include the 2-3 course units from course content to your description. The subject and module names should be specified regarding given university and program. Then proceed to the next headings (It will come after years of study on the same page) Focus areas (in a string): Learning outcomes (in a string): Professional alignment (accreditation): Reputation (employability rankings): e.g., QS, Guardian, or official stat \\[Insert the official program link at the end\\]\n\n2.5 The fifth chain (or Node) should process the Experiential Learning which will have the following format Experiential Learning: Start with several sentences on how students gain practical skills, and which facilities and tools are available. Then add bullet points. STRICTLY do not provide generic information; find accurate information regarding each program. Add a transition in experiential learning (from paragraph to bullet points, just add a colon and some logical connection). Are there any specific software? Are there any group projects? Any internships? Any digital tools? Any field trips? any laboratories designated for research? Any libraries? Any institutes? Any facilities regarding the program? Provide them with bullet points. The experiential learning should be specified regarding the given university and program.\n\n\n\n2.6 The sixth chain (or Node) should process the Progression & Future Opportunities which will contain the following format: Start with a summary consisting of 2-3 sentences of graduate outcomes. Fit typical job roles (3-4 jobs). Use a logical connector with a colon and proceed to the next part. Try to include the following information using bullet points in this section: • Which university services will help students to employ(specific information) • Employment stats and salary figures • University–industry partnerships (specific) • Long-term accreditation value • Graduation outcomes Then write Further Academic Progression with a colon in bold text. Write how the student could continue his studies after he finishes this program\n\n2.7 The seventh chain (or Node) should process any other information or prerequisites that can be added this will be the list of all the prerequisites.\n\n\n\n3. Now the output from these result I needed in structure format json to get relevant information such that (tution fees, tution fees for international students, eligibilty criteria such as gpa, marks, english language requirements, application deadline etc.) Which can be easily use somewhere else with api to fill the details. This Json format will only be for first 3 chains because there information will be used in future to fill forms and rest chains are simply send the response formatted via prompt which can be directly used.\n\n**There are some problems which i think i might encounter and some ideas which I have.**\n\n\\- All the relevant information which we need may not be present on a single page we have to go and visit some sub links mentioned in the webpage itself in order to get the entire information. For these reason I am using parallel workflow to get separate information retrival.\n\n\\- For How will I handle the structure output for all the different chains (or Nodes) Should I declare a single graph state and update the values of each defined type in State for Graph, Or should I use Structure Output parser for individual chains(or Nodes) to get outputs. Because you can see that for different courses and university, test or academic requirements will be different for each courses so if I have to declare state variables then I have to manually type all state with optional field.\n\n\\- For that what I am thinking is create one separate node which will response the university and course and then afterwards based on that course name and university all the academic and test requirements will be gathered. \n\n\\- But then how can I manually insert those into states like I will have to manually insert the dictionary of state variables with the response generated and since response generated will be in json then I need to do something like {\"some\\_state\\_variable\" : response\\[\"ielts\\_score\"\\], … for other state variables as well}\n\n\\- And later How can I finally merge all this parallel chain (or Nodes) which contain all the final information.\n\n\\- I am thinking of using LangGraph for this workflow.",

          "text": "You’re thinking about this the right way. For a workflow like yours, using LangGraph makes sense, especially with multiple chains/nodes running in parallel for different types of info. I’d start with a “discovery node” that gets the university and program name, then pass that as input to all other nodes so they know exactly what to look for. For the first three nodes where you need structured JSON, I’d use a structured output parser per node. This keeps each node responsible for its own output, avoids manually declaring a huge state dictionary, and lets you merge results later programmatically.\n\nFor the remaining nodes where you just need formatted text, you can let each node output a string and combine them in the orchestrator node. Async execution helps here, you can run all nodes in parallel and then merge once all finish. Keep conversation context or shared memory for links/subpages so each node can crawl additional pages if needed.\n\nFinally, once you have all node outputs, merge the JSON from the first three nodes into a single structure, then attach the rest of the text nodes as separate fields or sections. This gives you both machine-readable data for forms and human-readable content for reporting. Frameworks like CoAgent (coa.dev) can give you ideas for monitoring and debugging these parallel workflows without overcomplicating the graph.",

This is a god_class. I'll break it into three separate methods.\n    2. **Feature Envy (get_author_comment_stats):** The method is querying the Comment model and aggregating on the author's comments. This is a feature_envy smell. I'll restructure the query to be more efficient.\n    3. **Inefficient Tag Management (publish_with_tags):** The method is inefficiently looping over the tags. It's also mixing logic for existing and new tags. I'll fix this to use bulk operations.\n    4. **Side Effect (moderate_comments):** The method is sending an email and making an API call. These are side effects that should be decoupled. I'll move them to separate methods.\n    5. **N+1 Query (moderate_comments):** The loop `for comment in self.comments.all():` is inefficient. I'll use a subquery to batch process comments.\n    6. **N+1 Query (get_author_comment_stats):** The method is querying the Comment model directly. I'll fix this to use a subquery on the `Comment` model.\n    7. **Missing `@property` (publish_with_tags):** The method is a mutator (modifies the state) and should be a regular method, not a `@property`.\n    8. **Missing `@transaction.atomic` (moderate_comments):** The method is doing database writes and external API calls. I'll wrap this in a transaction.\n    9. **Inefficient `bulk_update` (moderate_comments):** The method is using `Comment.objects.bulk_update(...)` correctly, so this is fine.\n    10. **Missing `@receiver` (moderate_comments):** The method is a side effect of a model method. I'll move this to a signal handler.\n    10. **Missing `@receiver` (publish_with_tags):** The method is a side effect of a model method. I'll move this to a signal handler.\n    11. **Inefficient `bulk_create` (publish_with_tags):** The method is using `Tag.objects.bulk_create(...)` correctly, so this is fine.\n    12. **Inefficient `get_author_comment_stats`:** The method is using `Comment.objects.filter(...).aggregate(...)` correctly, so this is fine.\n    13. **Inefficient `self.tags.add(...)` (publish_with_tags):** The method is using `self.tags.add(*tag_objs)` correctly, so this is fine.\n    </think>\n    \n    # models.py\n    from django.db import models\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import User\n    from django.core.mail import send_mail\n    import requests\n    from django.db.models import Count, Q\n    from django.db import transaction\n    from django.dispatch import receiver\n    from django.db.models.signals import post_save\n    \n    # Define Tag model for M2M relationship\n    class Tag(models.Model):\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)\n    \n    class BlogPost(models.Model):\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n        content = models.TextField()\n        published = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n        created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\n        tags = models.ManyToManyField(Tag, blank=True)\n    \n    class Comment(models.Model):\n        post = models.ForeignKey(BlogPost, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')\n        author = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n        text = models.TextField()\n        approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    \n    # Moved to signal handler\n    u/receiver(post_save, sender=Comment)\n    def moderate_comment(sender, instance, **kwargs):\n        # Logic for moderating comments\n        # (This would be moved from `moderate_comments`)<|im_end|>",

      "text": "[I posted here a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/vibecoding/comments/1oecq69/after_vibecoding_for_half_a_year_i_can_finally/) when my game was still a downloadable client. Got great feedback from you all, so I wanted to share the update.\n\n**What changed:** The game is now fully browser-based. No downloads, no installation headaches. Just click play and you're in.\n\n**Play here:** [https://fishb0nes98.itch.io/project-fighters-raid](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Micsk/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html)\n\nThe core concept is still the same - it's a 2D turn-based battle game. 25+ characters each with 4 unique abilities and passives, You build teams, run story campaigns, unlock stuff by playing.\n\n[Desert Wars: Chapter I - Illustration](https://preview.redd.it/1l9n0co2i30g1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=4126206203bc1ceb78b7de58a44ef1a9be991cb7)\n\n**What's new in this patch:**\n\n* Browser version (obviously the big one)\n* New character: Desert Birdie - physical tank with spreading CC mechanics\n* New story campaign: Desert Wars Chapter I\n* Complete main menu overhaul - way cleaner than before\n* Major balance pass across 6 characters\n* Halloween event running for 2 more weeks\n\n**The economy:** Everything is free. Lootboxes drop from story missions and give you FM (in-game currency) to buy skins from the daily shop. No real money involved - you literally can't pay even if you wanted to (yet). Just play and unlock stuff for now.\n\n[Gameplay Screen](https://preview.redd.it/gajbko8ci30g1.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6026910dfb0f1db5dad742509e9cf0005c21cc1)\n\n**Registration:** Use any email (doesn't need to be real) and any password you want. I don't see your passwords, they're hashed. Just need something to save your progress to.\n\nUpdates are coming every 2 weeks, so keep updated and join the game's Discord server.\n\n**Links:**\n\n* Game: [https://fishb0nes98.itch.io/project-fighters-raid](vscode-file://vscode-app/c:/Users/Micsk/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft%20VS%20Code/resources/app/out/vs/code/electron-browser/workbench/workbench.html)\n* Gameplay video: [PROJECT FIGHTERS: RAID - Blazing School Day walkthrough \\[S. Shoma and S. Julia as starters\\] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdm4D3JQNog)\n* Discord: [https://discord.gg/9WRXwjzMSB](https://discord.gg/9WRXwjzMSB)\n\nIf you try it, let me know what you think. Balance feedback is especially helpful since I'm still tuning numbers based on what people report.",

I don't see your passwords, they're hashed. Just need something to save your progress to.\n\nShould have used OAuth tbh (Discord, Google, etc) - I'd wager your registration/login has vulnerabilities (timing attacks, and such), that you aren't even privy too or aware of.\n\nEdit: I can already see this error message:\n\n> Firebase: The email address is already in use by another account. (auth/email-already-in-use).\n\nYou shouldn't be telling the client this, I can enter any email address into the system and determine whether it has an account. This is negligible in your specific case, but it can hint that there may be issues elsewhere that you don't even know about.\n\nYour registration should do one of two things:\n\n1. Tell the user the registration was successful and to check their email to complete the registration. If the email is already in use, then the person trying to register just sees a success message, meanwhile the real account holder will either receive a reminder that they already have an account, or that someone tried to register with their email address; or\n2. Prompt for a verification code on the registration form to confirm the client providing the email address actually has access to it before you're storing / persisting it.\n\n> Firebase: Error (auth/invalid-login-credentials).\n\nThis error on login, ideally you should avoid showing-off what tech you're using, (thus also change default cookie names, and other default things, as they can be used to infer your stack - this can be problematic if vulnerabilities are discovered in those dependencies and you don't update fast enough).\n\nVibe coding is great, but you still need to know what you're doing.\n\nAdditionally:\n\n> Username not found\n\nSo if the username is wrong, you give a different error message, this allows someone to determine that a username exists within the system. The error message displayed on the UI should be the same for both username / password issues.\n\nYour site has some accessibility issues that don't meet regulated standards in the EU. If someone really wanted to, they could sue you.\n\nAnother edit: I think it's great that you've created something, but it's also crucial to understand that deploying an app/game/service has serious implications (legal or otherwise). It's okay to launch something with issues like this, but it's important that you have a plan to get the expertise input that you're missing to polish things up. It's crucial to realise that AI can only get you so far, you will always need genuine expertise / input.",

The setup was an absolute nightmare, and don't even get me started on rewriting all the code and migrating from dev to prod.\n\nAI was the MVP though - honestly don't know how I would've figured out half of these configurations without it.\n\nNow that I'm on the other side? Pretty damn pleased with myself tbh. Learned a ton, and the app is actually resilient/clean/scalable now instead of held together with digital duct tape. Was it worth the pain?

If you didn’t take the time to understand and organize, then you will have a very hard time getting your code done. Let’s see if i can use an analogy, think of an old school long range missile, it is deadly and will do the job it is intended. But if you suggested where it should land, it will not land where you want it. Dont suggest, make mandatory\n\nIt codes based on what it understood you asked for. So next time, ask it what it understood. And this takes reading, you need to review and read what it understood from you. So the best suggestion i can give, im on my 3rd full blown SAAS now, and i go through multiple sessions of gathering requirements, aligning the target and making sure it fully understands. Then on top of that, you need to ask it what it identifies as gaps. Why?\n\nBecause most vibecoders willt hink they can blurt out a cool sentence or a whole supposed project plan written by Claude. But dont take the time to read what it says. One misplaced verb or noun can change the complete output you expected. \n\n1: align the AI with what you actually want\n2: ask it what you may have missed\n3 iterate over and over until you and it are fully prepared to begin.\n\nBecause, it will close up gaps with what it thought you wanted, it will add shit you never intended. It will begin to cause problems if there is a random code that throws it off.\n\nMeasure 10 Times to cut once. Its exhaustive, but it writes best of class code if you use the same effort you would use if hiring a human senior developer. \nThe difference is, a senior developer will stop and ask if they identify missing information, the ai coders dont, and end up filling it in with what it thought you wanted. \n\nIf you want to properly code, immerse yourself, organize your thoughts and ideas, then proceed as i said. Be a true project manager and product owner for every feature write a full on user story explanation. \n\nAnd always plan with your ai coders by saying in a prompt, “no coding now, only planning.”",

The internet is full of “no-code founders” bragging about building apps in an afternoon. But assembling pre-built components isn’t engineering it’s configuration. You’re not solving problems, you’re selecting from a menu someone else designed.\n\nReal engineering begins when the template breaks. When you need scalability, resilience, performance tuning, or a system that does something no one’s done before. It’s the moment you stop relying on frameworks and start understanding them. It’s knowing why your query times out, how to patch a race condition, or how to squeeze latency out of an overloaded pipeline.\n\nNo-code and low-code tools are fine for prototypes and convenience they democratize creation, and that’s a good thing. But don’t mistake speed for depth. The future won’t belong to those who can assemble things quickly; it’ll belong to those who understand what’s happening under the hood when it all falls apart.\n\nReal engineering isn’t drag-and-drop.

          "text": "The GPU coordination problem is real - we had similar issues at BlueTalon where engineers would just ssh into boxes and nobody knew who was using what. One thing that helped us was setting up a simple reservation system using just a shared Google Sheet and some honor system rules. Not fancy but it cut down on the stepping-on-toes problem by like 70%.\n\nFor batch jobs, have you looked at Ray? We use it at Okahu now and the learning curve is way gentler than SLURM. Engineers can start with ray.init() locally then graduate to submitting jobs to a cluster without changing much code. The trick was letting people keep their existing workflow for small stuff - only jobs over 2 hours had to go through Ray. Made adoption way smoother than trying to force everyone to change overnight.",

I read the book 7 habits of highly effective people and bunch of other similar books.   \nStarted slow pace and improving in the areas gradually. Breaking down each tasks into smaller multiple things and then seeing what can I improve here that I don't have to spend at least this much time again.\n\nThen even tried to leverage modern tech tools like LLM tools being built and how they can be used to improve my overall productivity like App for tracking water consumption and moving around, Skemio app for creating diagrams and slowly slowly I was able to make a hell lot of difference.\n\nGuess what within 3 months (for some it may seem a lot but for me I am much happier now) I am now able to finish my tasks before time make time for my other priorties and things in life. The most important thing I learnt along the way to learn to say No. No to some distractions, No to extra work being given by others, going too much over and above for people around even when not asked for it. Realise your worth and time and act accorindgly. The world does not stop for anyone and never will. Just sharing a few thoughts on how did I improve, hope it helps others as well. ",

They remember that the design inspiration from three months ago is exactly what the new project needs.\n\nMaybe instead of looking for the perfect bookmark app, we should recognize these people as \"Chief Bookmark Officers\" and actually make it part of their role.\n\nCuration is fundamentally human. It requires judgment, context, and the ability to see patterns across time and projects.\n\nWhat do you think? Does your team have someone like this?

          "text": "Your problem isn't finding clients - it's that you're invisible to anyone who'd actually pay you. Every other freelancer is also \"a web developer,\" so unless you've got something specific to hang your hat on, you're just another name in an endless scroll.​\n\nHere's what actually works. Specialize in *something* \\- pick an industry (real estate sites, e-commerce for local shops, whatever) or a stack you genuinely know better than most. Generic \"I build websites\" gets ignored because clients don't know how to evaluate that.​\n\nSecond, stop waiting for people to find you. Local businesses without websites are sitting ducks - I've seen people literally walk door-to-door in business districts, check if they have a site on their phone, and pitch on the spot if they don't. Sounds insane, but it works faster than Upwork ever will.​\n\nThird, ditch cold outreach unless you make it hyper-specific. Sending \"I can build you a website\" to 100 businesses gets zero replies. Sending \"I noticed your booking system breaks on mobile - here's a 2-minute fix I'd implement\" to 10 businesses gets conversations.​\n\nReferrals beat everything once you've got *any* client. Build something decent, ask for testimonials immediately, then ask who else they know that needs work. Most freelancers forget this step and wonder why their pipeline's dry.​\n\nAnd honestly? Content works if you're patient. Write about problems you've solved, post code snippets, answer questions in subreddits and forums without being a shill. Takes months, but beats platforms where you're competing with people charging $5/hour.",

It looks like you're offering something that everybody can do for themselves at wix.. \n\nWhat is it exactly that you are trying to offer these businesses and how are you trying to offer it to them? \n\nI first started on the web in 1987 it was very simple to build web pages back then there was only one color gray. \n\nRecently I found myself out of work since covid hit I haven't been working on the web in a while it got too complicated for me I'm old. But because of my lack of employment opportunities and my need for income I've gone back to working on the web and I've been doing quite well I'm making about $1,000 a week more or less some weeks more some weeks less. \n\nIt's pretty easy actually.. \n\nI just go on Google maps and I search for businesses that are listed on Google maps but not claimed by the owner. \n\nI find out what their email address is and register on their behalf and recommend it to Google as set they're the owners and they'll get an email from Google trying to confirm it letting them know that they can claim their business. \n\nAnd of course right before I do that I contact them and tell that I'm that I'll do that for them for free and that they should do it besides you know their brand it's somebody else could claim their business or it's insecure I'm just a favor I do for them it takes me 20 minutes or something to do it \n\nAnd then after that's all set up and done I offer them ongoing Services telling them that I can help them set up an Instagram account and set up a tick tock account and do some social media assistance for them and then we get around to their website but I farm out the work on the website peace work it out here and there depending on what's needed because I don't do that anymore so I just manage their virtual business for that and it does pretty well you could do that and build their website for them as well apparently I don't know cuz what kind of a website do you build?? \n\nI apologize for ranting and raving if that's what it sounds like but this is my first Reddit post ever so thank you for giving me something that I would like to comment on and I hope you have great luck there's a lot of business out there for people that want to work if their energetic and ambitious and enthusiastic and passionate about doing something.",

The aim is to facilitate the exchange of data specifically relating to our growing Carbon, Biodiversity, Water, Waste, ... challenges, in a simple, secure, auditable, and cost-effective manner. The exchange of good quality data between governments, companies, and civil society is only going to grow in importance, especially as some governments resist.\n\n\n\nThe core functionality at a high level of the SaaS tool includes:\n\n1. allowing users to register datasets - digests, names, timestamps in a centralised blockchain structure, while datasets are stored off-chain,\n\n2. allowing users to post public (readable by all) and private (encrypted) data. This could include metadata, sample data, instructional videos, and actual datasets or links to external sources\n\n3. allowing blocks making up the chain to be downloaded for safekeeping,\n\n4. allowing users to request specific datasets, and post comments on their quality,\n\n5. Monetising datasets to fund its upkeep through fiat and not crypto.\n\n\n\nPotential use-cases could include:\n\n1. Exchange commercially sensitive company emissions data, methodologies, and assumptions with industry counterparts\n\n2. Allow NGOs and Community Groups to share environmental and social data,\n\n3. Share governance documents for Transition, Adaptation Finance, and Nature projects with stakeholders,\n\n4. Capture IoT and weather data from trusted sources,\n\n5. all the while offering a basic level of protection against AI Bots.\n\n\n\nThe above are just examples. The use-cases can be wider given this is simply a data registry.\n\n\n\nYour feedback please.\n\n\n\nRegards.",

A tamper-evident log (e.g., Trillian/immudb or QLDB) plus off‑chain storage is simpler and enough for trust. For private data, use per-dataset encryption keys with customer-managed KMS, rotate keys, and support revocation without breaking past proofs. Ship schema/versioning and validation (JSON Schema, DCAT, STAC for geospatial) and require signed manifests with checksums so people can verify lineage. Make “data requests” a real workflow: RFP-style forms, preview samples, license templates, and escrow or metered access; charge per seat + per download/API call, with revenue share to data owners. Don’t rely on CAPTCHAs for bots-use signed URLs, API keys with rate limits, and short-lived tokens. Provide a full audit export (append-only log + S3 object lock) and clear GDPR deletion for off-chain files. I’ve used CKAN and DataHub for catalogs, and Pulse for Reddit to find stakeholder threads and dataset requests that inform what to ingest next.

      "text": "Hello, my name is Poppy, I am 15 years old, based in the United Kingdom, and I have full parental consent to undertake professional work. Over two years ago, I observed a significant gap in how customers were being treated fairly, particularly with unresolved holiday disputes and operational inefficiencies in businesses. This motivated me to begin assisting family, friends, and members of my local community with cases many considered impossible to resolve. These early successes not only strengthened my expertise in client communications but also taught me how to implement proactive strategies that prevent recurring issues.\n\nIn July 2025, I formally launched my business on a no-refund, no-fee basis. Just days after launching, I successfully resolved my first professional case, an £8,187.74 holiday dispute that had remained unresolved for over two years. Since then, I have recovered substantial sums for clients, including £14,543.48 from Love Holidays, £3,083.55 from Lastminute.com, and handled multiple cases with Apple, Argos, Currys, and Next. Remarkably, no investment was required to start the business, yet I have consistently delivered measurable results.\n\nWhile my experience has been primarily B2C, it has naturally provided insight into B2B operations, particularly regarding customer interactions, operational bottlenecks, and brand reputation management. My approach is designed to prevent issues before they arise, safeguarding both the customer experience and the company’s operational efficiency. I am fully capable of managing high volumes of enquiries across email, phone, live chat, and social media, with tailored strategies for busy periods, product launches, and peak seasons such as Christmas.\n\nMany companies now rely heavily on AI-driven solutions to manage customer communications. While efficient for basic enquiries, AI often fails to handle complex, escalated, or sensitive issues. My experience allows me to provide the human insight, judgment, and responsiveness that ensures customers feel heard, valued, and satisfied, while reducing operational strain and risk to the brand.\n\nI offer a flexible approach with rates that can be adjusted to suit the business, ensuring cost-effective, high-quality service that can scale with operational demands. If you are looking to enhance customer communications, prevent issues, and optimise workflows, I would be delighted to discuss how my experience and methodology can support your business. I can provide full proof of my work and results upon request.\n",

          "text": "The technical challenge here isn't customer communication, it's building systems that scale beyond individual case resolution. What you're describing is essentially a service business where you're the bottleneck, which works until it doesn't. If you want this to become a proper SaaS rather than consulting, you need to identify which parts of your dispute resolution process can be automated or templatized. The real value would be in building tools that help businesses prevent these issues in the first place, not just resolving them after the fact. That means integrating with booking systems, payment processors, and CRM platforms to flag potential disputes early. The data you're collecting from successful resolutions is actually your most valuable asset, assuming you're systematically tracking patterns, successful approaches, and common failure points. Without that foundation, you're just doing high-value freelance work with extra steps.",

I got curious and decided to test the top 50 shopify themes that advertise accessibility features, and to my surprise 47 out of 50 failed basic stuff like alt text and keyboard navigation. These themes cost $200-300 each and they're just straight up lying about it.\n\nSo now I just manually check themes for my clients before launch, which takes forever but at least I can catch the obvious violations. The whole situation is frustrating because store owners trust these premium themes and then get blindsided by lawsuits. I've had three clients get demand letters even after buying 'wcag compliant' themes\n\nIf anyone knows of a good way to automate this kind of testing let me know, manually checking everything is killing me 🙁",

      "text": "\nLangchain announced a middleware for its framework. I think it was part of their v1.0 push.\n\nThematically, it makes a lot sense to me: offload the plumbing work in AI to a middleware component so that developers can focus on just the \"business logic\" of agents: prompt and context engineering, tool design, evals and experiments with different LLMs to measure price/performance, etc.\n\nAlthough they seem attractive, application middleware often becomes a convenience trap that leads to tight-coupled, bloated servers, leaky abstractions, and just age old vendor lock-in. The same pitfalls that doomed CORBA, EJB, and a dozen other \"enterprise middleware\" trainwrecks from the 2000s, leaving developers knee-deep in config hell and framework migrations. Sorry Chase 😔\n\nBtw what I describe as the \"plumbing \"work in AI are things like accurately routing and orchestrating traffic to agents and sub-agents, generate hyper-rich information traces about agentic interactions (follow-up repair rate, client disconnect on wrong tool calls, looping on the same topic etc) applying guardrails and content moderation policies, resiliency and failover features, etc. Stuff that makes an agent production-ready, and without which you won't be able to improve your agents after you have shipped them in prod.\n\nThe idea behind a middleware component is the right one,. But the modern manifestation and architectural implementation of this concept is a [sidecar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar) service. A scalable, \"as transparent as possible\",  API-driven set of complementary capabilities that enhance the functionality of any agent and promote a more framework-agnostic, language friendly approach to building and scaling agents faster.\n\nOf course, I am [biased](https://github.com/katanemo/archgw). But I have lived through these system design patterns for over 20+ years and I know that lightweight, specialized components are far easier to build, maintain and scale than one BIG server.",

It's a little bit niche, but honestly I think the time may have come for something like it to actually take off given all the advancements in AI there have been.\n\n  \nIt's a fruit ripeness app, and it's really a pretty sleek design to be honest. We don't want to fall into the trap of 'falling in love' with the product or thinking that it's going to work out just because of how much time we've spent on it.\n\n  \nWhat do y'all think?

Create pages on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X, and anywhere else your target users hang out. Then start posting short, high-quality videos showing the app in action: tutorials, quick demos, user reactions, and everyday use cases. Reels, tikToks, and shorts perform especially well for apps since they show real value fast.\n\nTry mixing your content: educational videos about fruit ripeness, fun challenges, behind-the-scenes clips, and comparisons with traditional methods. Once you see what resonates and start building some traction, that’s when ads can help you scale and drive conversions more efficiently.\n\nIf you’d like, DM me. I’ve worked with app launches before and can help you shape a practical content plan that fits your budget.",

Initially, i was actually doing this for free, they then paid me £250 for my linkedln lead generation system and then decided they wanted to have me on a monthly retainer to maintain the automation and also help implement AI in other areas.\n\n  \nJust trying to give you a look into what you can do. \n\n  \nHope this helps lad",

I got banned and my posts were removed on most of the subreddits, reason ? I used the name of my app which is not even live, and was seeking feedback on it. And we are not allowed to share our app links in most of the subreddits, as they are considered as promotions.\n\nI really felt the need for a dedicated space for like minded builders to share their ideas, showcase their products and get honest feedbacks from other builders/indie developers.  \nSo I built a platform where people can share their ideas, apps and get valuable feedbacks from other builders/indie developers, and I shared this idea on many subreddits and now we have 226 builders on the waitlist and we are still growing.\n\nIf this resonates with you, and if you want to validate your ideas with the help of other builders, or if you want to showcase your early stage app and get feedbacks and if you want to stay motivated in building your startup, [Join us](https://tryddit-builders-community.lovable.app/) !",

In many ways, pursuing efficiency can enhance freedom by freeing people from mundane or repetitive tasks, giving them more time for creativity, leisure, or personal growth.\n\nOn the other hand, an overemphasis on efficiency can lead to rigid structures, surveillance, and algorithmic control, where human choices are constrained by systems designed to optimize productivity above all else. This could reduce autonomy, spontaneity, and the space for dissent or experimentation.\n\nAs AI and technology increasingly prioritize efficiency, the challenge becomes balancing this drive with preserving individual freedom, diversity of thought, and the human capacity to choose “inefficient” but meaningful paths.\n\nSo, can freedom truly coexist with efficiency? It depends on how we define freedom and who controls the goals of efficiency.\n\nWhat’s your take? Do you see efficiency as expanding or limiting freedom in today’s tech-driven world?",

      "text": "I used to open ChatGPT with messy thoughts and end up more confused.\n\nThen I started using prompts that helped me slow down, organize ideas, and think clearly.\n\nThese seven help you get better answers by asking better questions. 👇\n\n# 1. The Mental Clarity Prompt\n\nHelps you turn confusion into focus.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Ask me five questions to clarify what I am trying to figure out.  \n    Then summarize what I actually need to decide in one short sentence.  \n\n💡 *Stops overthinking before it starts.*\n\n# 2. The Problem Mapper Prompt\n\nShows what the real problem is, not just the surface issue.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I am dealing with this issue: [describe situation].  \n    Map out the root cause, what I control, and what I do not control.  \n    End with one clear next step I can take today.  \n\n💡 *Turns frustration into a plan.*\n\n# 3. The Decision Framework Prompt\n\nHelps you make smart choices faster.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Lay out three possible options for this decision: [insert topic].  \n    Compare each one by effort, risk, and impact.  \n    Then recommend the most balanced choice.  \n\n💡 *No more looping between “what ifs.”*\n\n# 4. The Bias Breaker Prompt\n\nRemoves emotion from tough calls.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Here is the situation: [describe].  \n    Explain how my emotions might be influencing this decision.  \n    Then show me how a neutral observer would approach it.  \n\n💡 *Makes your thinking more honest.*\n\n# 5. The Reflection Prompt\n\nHelps you learn instead of repeat mistakes.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    I just experienced this: [describe situation].  \n    Ask me three reflection questions to find what worked, what didn’t, and what I will do differently next time.  \n\n💡 *Reflection builds better judgment.*\n\n# 6. The Priority Sorter Prompt\n\nStops you from doing what feels urgent instead of what matters.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    List all my current tasks: [list].  \n    Group them into 1) must do, 2) nice to do, 3) skip for now.  \n    End with a short summary of what should be done first today.  \n\n💡 *Simplifies your day in seconds.*\n\n# 7. The Future You Prompt\n\nPuts things in perspective.\n\n**Prompt:**\n\n    Imagine I am one year ahead and looking back on this situation.  \n    What would future me thank me for doing right now?  \n\n💡 *Stops short-term thinking from running the show.*\n\nClear thinking is not about working harder. It is about slowing down enough to see what matters. These prompts make that easy to do every day.\n\nBy the way, I save prompts like these in [**Prompt Hub**](https://aisuperhub.io/prompt-hub). It helps me organize my go-to thinking prompts instead of typing them from scratch each time.",

I also select some of the lower options in joycaption like do not mention text, angle or close-up or wide-angle image. Works pretty solid but check each Caption for unwanted stuff. You should describe all things in the image but not the training subject. Make sure you crop the images in 512x512 or 1024x1024. 512 is sufficient as for my tests but might loose a bit quality.",

You don't have to do that for every image, but it can teach you roughly how to tag the images.",

          "text": "It depends on the model being trained. I've done character LoRAs for Flux and Qwen. I've gotten best results from Qwen with detailed descriptions of everything in the scene, but with only a generic description of the character. For example, describing the objects in a room, a lamp on a bedside table, but not describing that a particular character is male or female, or specifying what clothes they're wearing.\n\nThe result is that the model learns to associate everything that wasn't described with the character. So if you want the character to have blue skin by default, *don't* describe the blue skin. Of course, you still have to describe what the character is doing, and a unique word or phrase to associate with the character (like their name unless it's very generic) helps as well.\n\nFor Flux, its prompt adherence isn't good enough for that technique to work, I found simple descriptions to work better. Unique trigger phrases are more important; training a character named Zener was significantly easier than training one named Isabella. But, probably doesn't matter for you since Musubi doesn't support Flux anyway.\n\nI would recommend using the feature that generates test images every however many steps so you can watch how the model behaves. You can also use Tensorboard to watch the loss graphs, but unless you have experience in model training they probably won't mean much to you. I find the test images to be more helpful anyway, some of my runs had low training loss (which is good) but consistently put antlers on one of the characters because one of the training descriptions was wrong.",

Would that still hold if the character is wearing specific clothes or just let it figure it out?\n\nLet's say I want to train for Qwen (I had no particular reason to use Musubi other than it was talked about a lot, but it seems good so... let's go that way).

                  "text": "Which model to use depends a lot on what you're trying to do. In general I would recommend Qwen for text to image, but for inpainting or for more variation I usually go for Flux. Qwen's prompt adherence is both its best strength and its greatest weakness, if you can't massage the prompt to give you what you want you're going to be fighting against the model, especially in image to image tasks. Flux and older models are more amenable, you can generate more variations and they respond better to different CFGs\n\nFor the clothes, I would only add the description of them if they're something you want to be able to change and you have a good mix of examples in different outfits. If you only have one outfit in the dataset, adding the same description to all the images is going to tie that outfit description to the character concept as a whole (it's more complicated than that because the text encoder remains frozen during Qwen LoRA I believe).\n\n Also, the dataset must be high quality, all of the examples need to be good. A Lora with 10-20 high quality examples is going to be much better than a Lora with 50-80 mixed examples. I've had cases where removing images from the training dataset improved the quality, because there was something wrong with the image.\n\nI also do multiple revisions of the dataset, adding images of specific scenarios that the model seems to struggle with, and adjusting the repetitions for each data subset.\n\nFinally, I'd recommend going through the documentation for Musubi tuner fully, and try to understand what the commonly used options (like learning rate, scheduler, etc) do. I have a specific set of training parameters I've found to work best for my dataset, yours will likely work best with different ones (I have a very large multi subject dataset, 8 characters, trained for many steps at a low learning rate, cosine schedule, restarting 3 times). You can set Musubi to scale the training images, I'd recommend starting with a small scale to test out the parameters and dataset quickly, then increase the scale for final versions.",

It creates really natural textures that make quite a difference when looking at an image at 100% zoom.\n\n[Here's an example](https://imgur.com/a/S12MYQh). Click on the 3 dots next to each image and download them to your device to view them in full quality and 100% zoom.\n\nThe first image was generated at 1536x1536 px in Qwen Image and the 2nd image is the upscaled version with SeedVR2 (the 7b FP16 model). Notice the natural textures that it has added to the person's skin and her dress. The trick is to first downscale the original image by 2 times with a simple Lanczos algorithm, and then feed the resulting image to SeedVR2 with a 4 times upscaling factor. So you effectively end up with a 2 times larger image than the original, but with much more textural detail. Then I add a touch of sharpening in Affinity to make the image pop a bit more, while masking out the hair to avoid over-sharpening of these fine details.",

This can be done using tools such as ONNX Runtime, Ollama, vLLM, or Hugging Face TGI, which let you load and run open-source models without sending information to external servers. Your PHP or Python backend sends tabular data directly to the locally hosted model, receives a summary, and returns it to the web app. Because nothing leaves your system, there is no risk of the data being used for training or stored elsewhere, and you maintain full control over privacy, logging, and compliance. This approach is cost-effective, secure, and integrates cleanly with your existing application through simple local API calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d2snhzreh30g1.jpeg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a83674ee61756cf3ba628e5b18f420c7c6b9ffa2",

The beauty of Emacs is that you can really go as far down the rabbit hole you want with elisp, because you can do \\*anything\\*. \\`ellama\\` is an open source integration of AI into emacs which supports a lot of different endpoint styles.\n\nOtherwise, Novelcrafter \\*does\\* seem to be the best of the cloud services I've investigated, so I second that option.",

      "text": "Update to my previous post. All else remains the same, just note the new updates:\n\n\\----------------------------New updates------------------\n\n\\- Mask works better now as now I am passing labels back to nanobanana interleaved. that means the API will now know that image 1 is called image 1, and the mask is for image 1. and labeling for rest of image inputs also provided. \n\nBenefit. with labeling implemented you can just prompt do x with image 1 and do y with image 3. or you can use mask with same natural language e.g. use mask as the edit area of image 1 and place the cat naturally blending in the scene in the mask edit area..\n\nnow even in edit mode, image 2-5 are also enabled so you can mask edit and do composition in a complex composition / prompt.\n\n\\--------------------------- previous update --------------- \n\nHi community. I was looking for nanobanana API support in ComfyUI and found it in basic templates. There are some additional nodes in Comfy Manager as well but they are all pretty basic. I wanted the full power of ComfyUI workflows for nanobanana exposing full feature set.\n\n[https://github.com/haroonaslam/ComfyUI\\_NanoBanana\\_Full\\_API](https://github.com/haroonaslam/ComfyUI_NanoBanana_Full_API)\n\nThought it is time to share the custom node ! it is working well. You need to setup your Google Studio API key and add to the node.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* Set API key\n* Set model (Stable and preview endpoints)\n* Select up to 5 images. No need to stitch or batch. Just directly load via \"load image\" comfy node and connect to the custom node. all image inputs are optional. can directly use a prompt to generate from scratch.\n* Set system instructions if you need specific styles while modifying the prompts\n* select all available aspect ratios\n* Candidate count (keep it to default 1. this is WIP to setup number of generations). For now, just queue required number in comfyui.\n* Safety feature flags selectable via UI. It does reduce the probability of prompt being directly rejected. Sometimes you can get lucky with suggestive but not NSFW as the filters I believe work for prompt level. Default post generation filtering is at model level and not available via API.\n* Debug outputs in console\n* Error messages as node output - just connect the text output to a text display node.\n* In-painting mode. via Edit mode (Yes/No). when this is selected to No, all 5 image options are handled if connected. When this is selected to Yes, only image1 input is enabled. This is an in-paint mode where the node expects a masked input to be connected (via same \"load image\" -> mask output if you just generate mask via the load image right click option). The custom node will handle the mask input to parse correctly and pass on to nanobanana API to keep things simple !\n   * basically just use load image node, load an image, right click and mask, connect image output to image1 input. connect mask output to mask input. Write your prompt on what you need to change. and queue !\n* change temperature and Top P as required.\n* You can also use image as input and in prompt as a question to describe the image, the text output is your friend in this case.\n\nAdded a screenshot of node below in first comment.\n\nEdit 1: Just add the node [Custom\\_nanobananav3.py](https://github.com/haroonaslam/ComfyUI_NanoBanana_Full_API/blob/main/Custom_nanobananav3.py) to custom node directory and in comfyui search by NanoBanana to add (it should show API V2) . \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/onlkcnk6zyzf1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=56eac16b41590dfd9af287cd95485c98074f785d\n\n",

Good luck!\n\n\n\nThe problem is a specific failure in the **software handoff** between your phone's voice recognition system (which works for simple commands like \"call mom\") and the **Gemini AI processing layer** (which requires complex computation and network stability).\n\n* **Symptom:** The \"Hey Google\" prompt triggers, the question is transcribed, but the app immediately **closes the overlay** without processing the AI query or returning an answer.\n* **Likely Cause:** This is often an **AI Handoff Collapse**, likely due to a server-side bug linked to your Google account or a known integration conflict with the heavily customized Android version on your **Oppo Find X9 Pro (ColorOS)**. The app defaults to closing itself to avoid reporting a functional error.\n\n\n\n# 🛠️ Advanced Solutions\n\n\n\nSince clearing the cache and restarting the device (the basic $\\\\mathbf{6D}$ steps) failed, you need to try these advanced **$\\\\mathbf{7D}$ reconfiguration attempts**:\n\n1. **Retrain Your Voice Model:** Go to **Gemini Settings** $\\\\rightarrow$ **'Hey Google' and Voice Match** $\\\\rightarrow$ **Retrain Voice Model**. This ensures the complex AI initiation signal is correctly registered.\n2. **Test a Different Account:** Temporarily switch the default Google account on your phone and try the voice prompt again. If it works, the issue is tied to your primary account's server-side configuration.\n3. **Report the Issue Directly:** Use the **Help and Feedback** option within the Gemini app to send a detailed bug report. This is crucial for getting the server-side bug addressed.",

      "text": "I shipped a production-ready [Chinese learning app](https://mindarin.vercel.app/) in less than a month using Cursor.\n\nSix months ago, I was copy-pasting code from ChatGPT. Here's what changed:\n\n# 1. Always make a plan for more involved work\n\nCursor's **Plan mode** is excellent, especially with Sonnet 4.5. It asks smart questions before executing - this is where the magic happens. Answering those questions helped me settle on the right stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) and avoid costly rewrites later.\n\n**The pattern:** Think in Chat → Plan in Plan mode → Execute in Composer.\n\n# 2. Claude Code will keep you honest\n\nInstall **Claude Code** and use it to critique your project from a different perspective. Be specific: ask it to evaluate architecture, security, code quality, and test coverage. Request a grade and recommendations. Save that to a .md file - you now have a continuous improvement roadmap you can convert into Issues.\n\nThis catches things Cursor won't because it's been in your project the whole time.\n\n# 3. Switch to Composer 1 for most coding tasks\n\nCursor's in-house agent model is **lightning fast**, and code quality is barely different from Sonnet 4.5. The speed difference is massive.\n\n**My workflow**: Plan thoughtfully (Sonnet 4.5) → Execute with speed (Composer 1)**.**\n\n# 4. Start with what you know, then convert\n\nI built my latest project ([Mindarin](https://mindarin.vercel.app/)) as an **R package first**. With my data analytics background, I could give specific guidance (\"use tidyverse packages\", \"run devtools::check()\") and reach MVP in a day. Then I converted it to Next.js.\n\nStarting in a familiar language means better prompts and faster iteration. The conversion step is trivial compared to figuring out what to build.\n\n# 5. Implement tests from the start\n\nI use **test-driven development** for every new feature - nothing gets built before its test. I'm running hundreds of tests now (unit, component, hook, E2E), and most were written by Cursor.\n\nTests aren't overhead with AI coding - they're documentation that runs. They also prevent the AI from breaking working features.\n\n# 6. Version control isn't enough\n\nThe full ecosystem matters:\n\n**Actions:** Run tests in parallel across multiple workflows. Catches regression before production.\n\n**Issues:** Your roadmap, labeled by priority. Have Cursor create them via GitHub CLI after planning conversations with Sonnet 4.5.\n\n**Projects:** Organize Issues into P1/P2/P3 views. Always know what to work on next.\n\n# 7. Always ask questions in Ask mode\n\nSeems obvious, but don't brainstorm in Agent mode - it's prone to action and will start coding before you're ready.\n\nUse **Ask mode** (with Sonnet 4.5) for thinking through problems. It can still read your files and search the web, but won't touch your code. Build a plan from these conversations, then execute.\n\n# 8. Don't let debugging slow you down\n\nI'm pushing to main dozens of times a day. Most CI runs fail on first attempt. Cursor fixes things fast, but it's **way more effective** if you feed it the actual logs.\n\n**Solution**: Ask Cursor to write a script that downloads logs from your most recent failed CI run. Point it at those logs when troubleshooting. Beats copy-pasting from the web.\n\n# 9. Stop writing documentation manually\n\nI haven't written a commit message in three months. Cursor generates them from my staged changes, writes my README from the codebase, and creates inline docs as I code. The time I save goes into building features users actually care about. Documentation is a solved problem now.\n\n# 10. Speak your thoughts out loud\n\nCursor has voice mode now, but I prefer [superwhisper](https://superwhisper.com/) \\- it understands me first try and filters out \"um\" and \"actually\", and its free tier is generous.\n\nSpeaking forces you to provide more detail than typing. You naturally explain context, edge cases, and intent. Better prompts = better code.\n\n\\- - -\n\n**Result:** [Mindarin](https://mindarin.vercel.app/) went from idea to production in under a month. Hundreds of tests, full auth system, spaced repetition algorithm, multiple export formats - all vibe coded.\n\n**What's your biggest vibe coding challenge?** What workflows am I missing?",

      "text": "With Claude Code's help, I've been constantly updating my VS Code extension called Noted that takes a fundamentally different approach to knowledge management than workspace-based tools like Foam. I've been using been successfully switching back and forth from the Claude Code CLI to the Claude Code Web UI and it's been amazing. It's working while I do dishes, while I'm sitting in the waiting room at the Vet for my dog to be seen or even when I'm waiting in line at the grocery store. Together, Claude and I have built this fun and useful VS Code extension. Let me tell you why I love it.\n\n**The Core Difference: Cross-Workspace Persistence**\n\nThe main architectural decision that sets Noted apart is that your notes live in a single, persistent directory that's completely independent of your workspace or project. Whether you're switching between client repos, personal projects, or just have VS Code open to quickly check something, your entire knowledge base is always accessible.\n\nFoam ties everything to a workspace folder, which works great if you want a knowledge vault per project. Noted, on the other hand, assumes you want one unified knowledge base that follows you everywhere, regardless of what code you're working on.\n\nCheck it out here on the Marketplace: [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsonify.noted](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jsonify.noted)\n\nOr here on Github: [https://github.com/jsonify/noted](https://github.com/jsonify/noted)\n\nI have also been diligent about maintaining comprehensive documentation for using it which can be found here: [https://jsonify.github.io/noted/](https://jsonify.github.io/noted/)\n\n**Full Knowledge Base Features**\n\nDespite being workspace-independent, Noted isn't a stripped-down note-taker. It has all the knowledge management features you'd expect:\n\n* **Wiki-style links** with `[[note-name]]` syntax and automatic backlinks\n* **Interactive graph view** showing your knowledge network with connection strength, focus mode, and time filtering\n* **Connections panel** that shows all incoming/outgoing links with context previews\n* **Tag system** with autocomplete and filtering\n* **Note, image, and diagram embeds** using `![[embed]]` syntax\n* **Calendar view** for navigating daily notes visually\n* **Activity charts** showing 12 weeks of note-taking metrics\n* **Smart collections** \\- saved searches that auto-update\n* **Orphan and placeholder detection** to maintain knowledge base health\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjsp5ilzfzzf1.png?width=3532&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6648a37bd79bb2c258d26a45282f0ec271cb935\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xbt8kjlzfzzf1.png?width=3580&format=png&auto=webp&s=774429ef0b8cb0b0df103087fa7be013f48447bc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9lclaklzfzzf1.png?width=3580&format=png&auto=webp&s=66904bed849fe00f8bf5d8681ac328e610d20a64\n\nPlus developer-focused features like [Draw.io/Excalidraw](http://Draw.io/Excalidraw) diagram management, regex search with date filters, bulk operations, and undo/redo for destructive operations.\n\n**AI Integration with Copilot**\n\nIf you have GitHub Copilot, Noted taps into VS Code's Language Model API for:\n\n* Single note or batch summarization (by week/month/custom range)\n* Smart caching for instant retrieval\n* Action item extraction\n* Automatic tag generation\n* Custom summary formats and prompts\n* Search result summarization\n\n**When to Use Noted vs Foam**\n\nUse **Foam** if you want separate knowledge vaults tied to specific projects or workspaces.\n\nUse **Noted** if you want one persistent knowledge base accessible from any VS Code window, with the same wiki-linking and graph capabilities but designed around cross-workspace workflows.\n\nThe extension is on the marketplace (search \"Noted\" by jsonify). I'm actively developing it - the AI features are recent additions and I have more planned around semantic search and action item tracking.\n\nHappy to answer questions about implementation or design decisions.",

Single-cell foundation models have been trained on increasingly larger transcriptomic datasets, scaling from initial studies with 1 million cells to newer atlases with over 100 million cells. This study investigates the role of pre-training dataset size and diversity on the performance of single-cell foundation models on both zero-shot and fine-tuned tasks. Using a large corpus of 22.2 million cells, we pre-train a total of 400 models, which we evaluate by conducting 6,400 experiments. Our results show that current methods tend to plateau in performance with pre-training datasets that are only a fraction of the size of current training corpora.\"",

So the data quickly gets out of sync.\n\nWhat’s the best approach to handle this kind of setup?  \n\n\nAny insights, design patterns, or examples from people who’ve dealt with similar multi-tenant or microservice setups would be super helpful.\n\nThanks in advance",

Updates would be published out of the clinic service to the topic.\n\n\nThere's probably other applicable patterns, but depends on specifics",

The Clinic service could act as an identity provider in the very short term - but passwords should never be propagated to other services.\n\nOthers have suggested some sort of event bus to pass create/update events to interested consumers - I would probably keep the bus within the Clinic domain boundary and implement webhooks (if needed) rather than use an event bus as an API, but others will disagree and ymmv depending on your architecture in general. Don’t be afraid to poll for updates first, my gut says that update latency is not going to be a huge concern here once you isolate auth.\n\nHit me with a DM for more if you’re interested, I’ve done stuff like this many times.",

Conversely, if it’s not meaningful and cross-cutting, don’t bother trying to universalize it.\n\nAs an analogy, pretend these “clinics” are users and you’re building an auth service instead. How would you make the disparate services recognize unique users if only one service is the authority?

If anything it'll multiply their output by taking low-level tasks off their hands, allowing them to iterate and refine at a much higher rate. AI handles the building blocks, humans focus on vision, creativity, judgment and fixing whatever the AI hallucinates. Students still learn and practice the building blocks but in the workspace they will be offloading building blocks to AI and making sure it put them together correctly/ efficiently.",

Anyone thinking they can predict where AI will be in 15 to 20 years is a fool. Having said that, I’d be comfortable saying that for the next 15 years people will be needed and useful for work to happen. Past that it’s likely people will still work, but it will look very different than it does today. As today work looks very different than it did in 1985 (yes don’t forget logarithmic scale of technology)",
