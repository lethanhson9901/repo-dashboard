      "text": "ok so for context ive been doing this for about 3 years now. startups bring me in when shit hits the fan - not the \"we ran out of money\" fan, the \"our product literally cannot scale and we have no idea why\" fan\n\nand theres this pattern that shows up EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.\n\nmonth 1-6: everything is great. moving fast, shipping features, customers are happy, lifes good\n\nmonth 7-12: things start slowing down. weird bugs popping up. \"we'll fix it later\" becomes the team motto\n\nmonth 13-18: you literally cannot add a new feature without breaking 3 old ones. every deploy is stressful\n\nmonth 19-24: youve now hired 3 more engineers and theyre just maintaining the existing mess. not building anything new\n\nmonth 25+: rebuild from scratch or watch your startup die in slow motion\n\n**what i found in those 47 codebases:**\n\nlike 89% had zero database indexing. ZERO. your app is slow because youre searching through 100,000 records on every single request. thats not a bug thats just... why\n\n76% were paying for like 8x more servers than they needed. the average is 13% utilization - youre paying for 100 servers and using 13 of them. burning $3k-15k a month for nothing\n\n68% had auth vulnerabilities that would make any security person have a panic attack\n\n91% had no automated tests at all. so every new feature is literally russian roulette\n\n**the math on this is depressing:**\n\navg engineer salary is like $120k right stripe did research showing devs spend 42% of time dealing with bad code so for a team of 4 over 3 years thats $600k+ just... wasted. on maintaining garbage then add $200-400k to rebuild plus 6-12 months of lost revenue during the rebuild total damage per company: $2-3M\n\nand founders dont realize until month 18-24. by then youve raised series A based on growth that is about to completely fall apart\n\n**what actually prevents this:**\n\nhonestly just spend 2 weeks on architecture before writing code. i know its boring and you wanna ship fast but those 2 weeks save you 18 months of hell\n\nthink \"what breaks at 10,000 users\" not \"what works for 100 users\" - your db queries, file uploads, background jobs, everything needs to handle 100x day one\n\nautomate tests from the start. if you cant click one button and know nothing broke youre just gambling\n\npick boring tech. react/node/postgres is boring and thats GOOD. you can hire for it, theres stackoverflow answers, it doesnt randomly die at 2am\n\nget someone whos done this to review your architecture in WEEK ONE. not month 12 when its too late\n\n**the part nobody wants to hear:**\n\nmost technical cofounders and first eng hires are really good at coding but have never architected something that scales. its like being a great cook but never running a restaurant kitchen during dinner rush\n\nreal example from last month - saas company spending $47k/month on aws\n\ni did a 3 day review and found:\n\n* running 40 servers when they needed 6\n* storing files in literally the most expensive way possible\n* db queries taking 4 seconds that should take 40 milliseconds\n\nnew bill: $8,200/month\n\nthey saved $38,800 PER MONTH. thats $465k a year. for 3 days of work.\n\n**why im posting this**\n\nbecause im tired of watching founders burn 18 months and $500k-2M learning lessons that are completely avoidable\n\n\"move fast break things\" works when youre facebook with unlimited money. for your startup its just suicide\n\n**if youre building something right now ask yourself:**\n\n* what breaks at 10x current users?\n* do you have automated tests?\n* can your db handle 100x the queries?\n* would your infrastructure cost $50k/month at 10k users?\n\nif you said \"i dont know\" to any of these youre building on quicksand\n\nhappy to answer questions about tech stack or architecture stuff in comments. ive seen this movie too many times. \n\nMeir Avimelec Davidov (You can search me over linkedin)  \nFounder & CEO of gliltech software",

He thinks he can put it on his linkedin just because he did an 8 hour online course from HarvardX on basics of leadership.\n\nSo assuming OP didn't lie about his experiences in start-ups (he 100% did lie), his diagnosis of the issues make no sense.\n\nUnindexed db is just pure incompetence so if this is your problem then you have many more things to worry about, like learning the basics of programming.\n\nAutomatic testing is not required in start-ups and often comes at much later stages.\n\nAuth vulnerabilities by themselves would never fail a start-up. Only data leakages caused by them would. So it's a very weird point.\n\nThere is rarely such a thing as bad code, all the code written by other people is bad while all the code written by me is either perfect or I have an excuse. It's always like that. Saying you should \"improve\" your code so that the devs spend less time wrestling with it is an insane statement, beyond basic quality controls. Bad code is almost always code that does something in a way that unexpected new reqs were not accounted for. And you can't expect the unexpected.\n\nAutoscaling servers is hard. It's always better to just get what you need and then some. Within reason of course. And then leave the actual deployment optimization to dev ops engineers that you can hire later.\n\nThe post is really nonsensical. If there is one thing you should learn, it's to recognize obvious slop and outright lies.\n\nEDIT: Also OP most likely bought upvotes. Weekend numbers like this make no sense. Especially on such a low quality post. And his linkedin is a trove of obvious lies and misrepresentations, even sneakily claiming he founded a company with 80k customers, while in reality he worked for an already established company with 80k customers as a low level employee, and then wording his claim in such a way where he has plausible deniability.",

Not just for startups but for most companies.**\n\nCompanies (not just startups) routinely slap a basic authentication method in front of a resource and call it a day. The problem is that authentication is a wide and varied topic with a lot of nuance, and there is often a failure to understand and select (or architect) an authentication method that meets the actual needs and scenarios of the resources being protected and its users in a rigorous manner.\n\nAnd once selected, to even start to make authentication truly meaningful, a company needs to operate that authentication (from end to end) with an extreme level of operational maturity. Most startups do not have the experience or capability to do this, and for most companies the expense of operational maturity isn't seen as worth the cost.\n\nAnd it is often deemed not worth the cost because:  \n1. Honestly, a baseline deterrent is probably enough most of the time. A bad actor who truly wants to get to a resource eventually will. It's an asymmetrical game in the bad actor's favor.  \n2. Even with rigorous operational maturity, it tends to still be fragile. It only takes a single idiotic maneuver by an admin, user, code commit, etc to expose something sensitive in a problematic fashion.  \n3. **Companies do not think creatively enough about the lengths that bad actors will go to.**\n\nI want to harp on the third for a moment, as I think this is the largest blind spot. I see this often, especially in table-top scenarios: people often fail to think creatively about how bad actors work and they put too much faith in to things that are circumstance. And companies fail to realize when they're targets and how they are of value.\n\nExamples: An engineer took the stance that the leak of a private key within a customer-only portal was not problematic because \"Only customers have access to that system, and a customer would not want to do that to the company or other customers.\" To which I countered \"That presumes every customer is a legitimate customer.\" Once a fintech company told me that they would *never* be a target. They failed to recognize that they housed extensive private information about individuals performing incredibly large financial transactions across their system. Because they felt their industry was boring, they presumed that their data was boring too. **Companies often fail to recognize that data stolen from them is often more valuable when applied to scenarios that do not involve them.**",

They specified that the clients come to them with code base/tech stack scaling problems, not sales or marketing problems.\n\nThe failures they're talking about are in a different wheelhouse than yours, and I can believe that OP has found a good market for their services because I have seen these very same failures happen internally at large companies. Big company gets internal buy-in for a project with budget of X-many-thousands of dollars and the project ends up having to get killed because of the exact same problems OP mentions. It's not a market fit issue in that case either, the company had a strong internal need and demand, but if you're blowing your budgets due to poor architecture, there's nothing that can fix that except better architecture. It's pure budget math.\n\nAnd in the post-cloud world it's an extreme risk, because you can get a lot further along just clicking a few buttons and adding more servers quickly as a bandaid, and the bill doesn't come until the end of the month, or the quarter. In the old days where you had to buy the blades up front or sign new-colocation agreements, you became more aware of the financial pain the technology was causing earlier in the process and could prioritize it. Nowadays it's like, \"oh shit, we've got a production issue, try scaling up\" and pretty soon you've got a $10k/mo business hyperscale database when you only have 500 paying customers at 20/mo.\n\ntl;dr: I believe OP has seen what they say they have seen, I've seen it too.",

But the reason that it would cost too much isn't that it had to, but rather because the architecture required 50x as many servers compared to an architecture with good design. \n\nYes, if your income is so high that you can overcome the initial crap software engineering, then sometimes you can succeed despite having bad software. But there are plenty of business opportunities that are viable enough to succeed, but only with the proper software engineering from the start.\n\nThe irony is that it doesn't need to cost more to get that software engineering done right the first time. It certainly needs to cost more *per developer* to build a strong foundation. But if you only need three developers instead of twenty, and they get the work done faster and write more robust code, it's a huge win.\n\nBut instead companies end up hiring offshore teams that are \"cheap\" and that waste years to create a huge pile of technical debt that is worth nothing.",

The admin that did the original implementation is long gone and cheaper, junior admins have come in to try and keep things moving, but they spend most of their time doing manual tasks that should be automated and just trying to remember where things are so they can avoid a total meltdown. Always overspending on modules and integrations that are broken or no one is using, bandaids and workarounds everywhere.\n\nHonestly it’s more fun with the smaller companies who are interested in doing it right early, those are the engagements I enjoy the most because everything isn’t wrapped up in urgency and stress.",

Use a strangler approach for legacy: define a thin module boundary, add contract tests, then replace hotspots one by one instead of a rewrite. New Relic for traces and Sentry for regressions, while DreamFactory gives us quick REST APIs over legacy SQL and Mongo so we can refactor behind stable contracts. Quick wins: add pgstatstatements, run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on top 10 queries, cap N+1s in CI, and set a 5% weekly debt quota. Small guardrails beat month-18 rebuilds.",

Feature speed ground to a halt and we ended up with barely used features with crazy complex architectures that imagined that this feature was going to be centre of the future of the platform and was hideously over engineered, where the reality was most features missed the mark and were sidelined as we learnt what users wanted.\n\nAfter all that bullshit, we still needed to rewrite the whole thing about 24 months in as it was too bloated and complex to build on.\n\nI've come to realise that can't it's like the most immutable developer trait. Someone who likes building fast, hates slowing down and doing all the design stuff as they see it as time wasting, when they could be shipping features and someone who loves scalable coding usually thinks the other guys are idiots and they are far superior. You try to get one to do the other and they usually quit rather than do it.\n\nHaving built multiple products from scratch, I'd rather the quick scrappy guys to get started and then layer in some of the other guys as you need to scale. I just try to steer things a little, so scaling isn't too bad but get those guys in too early and your company will die before you get any customers.",

But this is a functioning, executable JavaScript script that's been heavily obfuscated to resist static analysis.\n\nThere is no \"encryption\" here. It's just code. The challenge in this case is to either run it in a debugger to see what it does or to statistically untangle the layers of string manipulation and self modifying logic to reconstruct the original program. Of course I'm heavily simplifying here.\n\nSaying \"debug at runtime\" ignored inevitable anti debugging \"layers\" and in a real situation you will be back at the chopping board (static analysis). You can't just feed this into a generic tool and expect a clean output. There is no equivalent to a PNG viewer in this case. The actual job is in building the custom analysis and lifter to deobfuscate the logic into a clean intermediate representation you can actually reason about.\n\nI haven't run this with public tools because I don't care but most likely it won't work. I only took a small look at the bin the guy sent so I may be going over the top here.",

The server and HDD were 13 euros in total, so even if it fails monthly that's still 7 euros a month left over for electicity, so as long as it isn't continuously drawing over 30W that's still profit.  \n\nOf course this is valuing OP's time at nothing. So we have to hope that either:  \n1. The server doesn't need replacing monthly and has a much more likely lifespan of ~2 years  \n2.

I've a 5090 for example, does that make me GPU poor? In terms of LLMs sure, but in terms of general population, I'm nigh-infinitely closer to someone with an H200 at home than to someone with a laptop rtx 2050.

It supports downloading playlists, channels, live streams and includes features like scheduling downloads, sending notifications, and built-in video player.\n\nI shared this project back in [old post](https://old.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/1l1p76w/ytptube_a_selfhosted_frontend_for_ytdlp/) and the reasons why i made it.  Basically YTPTube has the following features and more:\n\n* Multi-download support.\n* Random beautiful background.\n* Handles live and upcoming streams.\n* A Dual mode view for both technical and non-technical users.\n* Schedule channels or playlists to be downloaded automatically with support for creating custom download feeds from non-supported sites. See [Feeds documentation](https://github.com/arabcoders/ytptube/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-monitor-sites-without-rss-feeds).\n* Send notification to targets based on selected events. includes [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) support.\n* Support per link options.\n* Support for limits per extractor and overall global limit.\n* Queue multiple URLs at once.\n* Powerful presets system for applying `yt-dlp` options. with a pre-made preset for media servers users.\n* A simple file browser.\n* A built in video player **with support for sidecar external subtitles**.\n* Basic authentication support.\n* Supports `curl-cffi`. See [yt-dlp documentation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#impersonation)\n* Bundled `pot provider plugin`. See [yt-dlp documentation](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/PO-Token-Guide)\n* Automatic updates for `yt-dlp` and custom `pip` packages.\n* Conditions feature to apply custom options based on `yt-dlp` returned info.\n* Custom browser extensions, bookmarklets and iOS shortcuts to send links to YTPTube instance.\n* A bundled executable version for Windows, macOS and Linux. `For non-docker users`.\n\nExample screenshots [regular view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArabCoders/ytptube/dev/sc_short.jpg), [simple mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArabCoders/ytptube/dev/sc_simple.jpg)\n\nI am happy to answer any questions regarding the app, I think finally i have my vision for the app completed feature wise.",

On top of my head things that would differentiate YTPTube from MeTube, would be \n\n* Automatic support for live streams and automatic re-queue.\n* Tasks to queue channels/playlists with support for creating your own feeds.\n* Powerful presets system.\n* A dual view mode for techie and non-techie ppl so they don't get confused with all options and flags etc.\n* Can set cookies per link/preset etc.\n* Conditions feature to act based on given information to change options etc\n* Automatic yt-dlp update on container restart\n\nAnd many more, you could see the list in the main post with majority of the features.",

Its killer feature is that it automatically detects relationships between tables, and allows you to view/edit related records\n\n3. OBS. I do not stream but record videos a lot. I record job interviews, 1-1s, and work meetings. I don’t know why but it’s very hard to find video recording software that would record both your mic and system sound out of the box.

But it is pretty much complete overkill for the kind of stuff I do for my own projects, and I absolutely refuse to \"rent\" software from Adobe (or anyone). I find Gimp to be a quite acceptable replacement and it's rare that I encounter something I need to do that it can't manage.\n\nIn the 90s I learned vector illustration on CorelDraw, which I loved. There were a lot of things it did really well. It was the one tool that I missed when I switched from Windows when Corel stopped releasing their Linux version. I keep a VM with an old version of CD8 to fiddle around with even now. Since then, I've used Illustrator, but didn't like it. I'm pretty fond of Inkscape, though I don't find its handling of paths to be intuitive nor do I think it's as feature complete as Draw.\n\nMost of my paying work and all my personal projects are handled from the CLI. But when I occasionally need illustrations or graphics, these two are what I turn to. I pretty much couldn't live without them.",

It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdium gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage! Furthermore, Ferdium is compatible with your existing Franz account, so you can continue right where you left off.

Though the concept is pretty ancient, using different terms. Gnostics for instance, refer to them as the people who are sleeping while awake. I started realizing this a lot when I was relatively young. That way too many people don't even understand why they believe what they believe. It's like they are on cruise control, and just latch onto whatever response feels good. It's obvious they never really interrogate their opinions or beliefs. They've never tried to go a few layers deep and try to figure out WHY that belief makes sense or does not. It just feels good to believe and others they think are smart, say it, so it must be true. But genuinely, it's so obvious they've never even thought through the belief. \n\nTo me, what I consider standard and normal, to interrogate new ideas, and explore all the edges, challenge it, etc... Isn't actually as normal as I assumed. I thought it was a standard thing because I consider it a standard thing. \n\nIt becomes really obvious online because once you start to force the person to go a layer deeper than just their repeated talking point, they suddenly start getting aggressive, using fallacies, deflecting, and so on. It's because you're bringing them a layer deeper into their beliefs that they've actually never explored. A space they don't even have answers for because they've never gone a layer deeper. So they have no choice but to use weird fallacious arguments that don't make sense, to defend their position.\n\nI used to refer to these people as just AI: People who do a good job at mimicking what it sounds like to be a human with arguments, but they don't actually \"understand\" what they are even saying. Just good at repeating things and sounding real. \n\nAs I get much older I'm literally at a 50/50 split. That we are literally in a simulation and these type of people are just the NPCs who fill up the space to create a more crowded reality. Or, there really is that big of a difference in IQ. I'm not trying to sound all pompous and elitist intellectual, but I think that's a very real possibility. The difference between literally just 15 IQ points is so much more vast than most people realize. People 20 points below literally lack the ability to comprehend 2nd order thinking. So these people could literally just have low IQs and not even understand how to think layers deeper. It sounds mean, but I think there's a good chance it's just 90 IQ people who seem functional and normal, but not actually intelligent when it comes to critical thinking. Or, like I said, literally just not real.",

I disagreed with an old acquaintance on FB the other day about an anti-AI post she made, brought some facts/links with me, and she actually backed down, said I had a point, and invited me to a party later this month LOL. But I feel like that's a real unicorn of a reaction these days.",

Mind you I am not a very liberal person, I did believe so called woke-ism was going too far before Trump was elected and I saw a lot of similar liberal minded people who were just talking in slogans like ''diversity'' and ''oppression'' etc. without actually examining why the world is like it is. I would not say I was happy that Trump was elected, but I was not surprised and rather neutral on it. \n\nBut now I saw it aggressively being pushed by ''Trump'' guys. For some reason Macron or Trudeau or Hamas came into conversation even though the peace prize was not given to either of them, but to Venezuela opposition activist who even dedicated it to Trump. \n\nTo be honest, the prize is even very rarely given to top politicians of any country, usually they are some activists. There was Obama in 2009 but it was in the context of what had happened, ''Great Recession'', War on Terror etc. and Obama came with the ''hope'' message''. Trump came with a message to annex Greenland and ask Canada become part of USA... There have been tries that he made to bring peace to Middle East or Ukraine, but so far they have not worked, so what is the reason to give it to him?\n\nBut some people are hell bent on it.",

But then again even with my techno optimism I did not expect to have ''AI'' at this level already now, and who knows what future brings. I am not 100% claiming all those wonders will come true and there MIGHT be a bubble at the moment, but also I do not know how much they are actually spending over say next year. If it is in 10s of billions, then it is still not a territory that will crash anything as those companies and people have lined their pockets well. If it is in 100s already, well then we are in a different ball game...\n\nWhat I also see is that AI even at its current capabilities is nowhere near deployed to its full potential in enterprise world, because it moves slowly, so they do not often even have latest models properly deployed. And it is also not deployed to the full extent to be useful as they are very afraid, those legacy firms, that data will be leaked or whatever. It is for example absurd that in my company AI is only deployed basically as a search engine for intra-net, like published company documents in internal net. It is not even deployed to all the department ''wikis'' of sorts, all the knowledge all the departments have, so in my daily life it is rather useless. I could search for information on intranet already before, it was a bit less efficient but info there is also very straight forward and common knowledge, we already know all that. What AI would be good is to take all the data company has that is not structured and stored in e-mails etc. of people and make sense of it, but... it is not YET deployed that way.\n\nEven for coding it would be way better if all those legacy companies agreed to share their code to the ''machine'', then it could see more examples of some weird and old implementations etc. and would be of better help, but they are all protecting it and it stays walled in, even though it is shit legacy stuff that barely does its job... so Copilot or whatever does not even know what to do with it, as it has not seen any other examples of it out there to make sense of it all.\n\nIt is again a great time I think for AI and modern best coding practices to kick ass of incumbents.",

That stuff existed on a private branch for the commercial offering (pangolin cloud). They decided it would be better to bring it all together, and dev in the open. The license changes as far as I'm aware only apply to the pangolin cloud stuff (I'm taking what the devs said as gospel, and haven't checked).\n\nOn discord they are happy to talk about this.\n\nMy view for what it's worth is this should mean the community edition gets the benefits the cloud edition gets much quicker (if not at the same time). They haven't paywalled stuff in the community edition yet (actually we get stuff for free cloud doesn't - oidc for example).",

Which state that files licensed will have a header specifying which license governs it. So fairly easy to look for what features are locked behind commercial license.   \n\nFiles license for commercial licenses are redis, db, remote exit node, rate limits (and associated features like notifications),private exit nodes, billing, org user accounts, and some more.  \n\nEssentially, things that is used for enabling commercial use of pangolin is licensed under commercial license. All the regular stuff we have now doesn't seem to be affected.   \n\nEdit: per their comment in the discussion, they made it even easier, anything in the server/private folder is commercial.

They literally pursue those over what the researchers want. \n\nI mean they should really look into their researchers. I’ve read some of their papers and I’m surprised they didn’t implement a few things from their *own* research papers. \n\nObviously you wanna monetize but you can’t be monetizing something nobody likes or uses, that should come after you make a decent model and based off the salaries Zuck is paying, I seriously don’t see the point in monetizing this early.",

They say it’s investing in “AI and Machine Learning”, but when pressed mention they’ve used it for non-language based tasks like recommendation algorithms and ad attribution tracking. This of course is making them a lot of money, since ads and algorithmic feeds are their core products.  \n\nThey also had some early success (with things like early Llama’s), so they clearly have some tech and abilities. They seemed to stop hitting the cutting-edge of LLMs when LLMs moved to reinforcement learning and “thinking”. That was one of the big DeepSeek moments. \n\nThe obvious reason is because their LLM usages didn’t need any real abilities. What business-profitable task were they going to train Llama to do besides appease Mark? They dont need to spend their money building an LLM to do advanced tasks, especially not when they had more valuable tasks for their GPU clusters. xAI and other labs have no competing interest for their money, and they’re trying to find *paying customers* so they need to build an LLM for others, not internal usage. And that pushed them to continue improving. \n\nEqually importantly, they didn’t have data to understand what a complex-use conversation would look like. They aquihired scale.ai, but did so when most big labs moved to in-house data, and scale/wang just didn’t keep up. All the big advanced agents and RL-trained models had lots of samples to base synthetic training data off of. But Meta had no source of samples to build a synthetic dataset from because they had no real LLM customers.",

And they don’t see any benefit in entering that saturated market in any meaningful way. \n\nTraining for consumers and specialists requires high quality useful and accurate data. That is not  what META is swimming in, and other companies are way better situated for it. Whereas the other players have secured access to some of the best data in various ways, and shaped it effectively in both manual and artificial ways for effective training. \n\nWhat data do they have? Graphs of nodal social connections, social message diffusion, engagement, sentiment, interests, incredible detailed marketing, entertainment and games. \n\nWhile this data isn’t going to get your average user excited as an ‘answer all’, or allow you to train a very generalist LLM, it does offer a rich backbone for a satisfying socially immersive world building AI that can artificially engage, develop narrative, predict relevance & meaning in environments (this is a really huge AI obstacle that current non-situational llms aren’t great at). I think they are also unsure the best route, hence why they tried some weird initial routes (characters, companions, doubles…) which suit entertainment use, not general utility. \n\nThe problem I think, is this, and they are trying to move and plan for something that doesn’t exist yet, but most likely will at some point in the next 3-5 years in a big way. The immersive layer to the world via lightweight AR wearables and a more appealing metaverse tied to that. \n\nThey see Nvidia & Apple as their main future threats for consumer attention, and Google/amazon as their competition for selling B2B. Not OpenAi, Anthropic, etc. \n\nNvidia for the their integrated technology for deep world building which they created to train situated AI for robotics. And Apple for its proficiency, quality and semi-first to market functional full world AR device. \n\nMany will say it’s already failed, but that simply isn’t correct, as we are still in the most cursory development and technology stages. And Meta has positioned itself towards this future with its new products (raybans, glasses, etc). And it’s continuing in the VR market (especially opening up its platform recently). \n\nThis requires a completely different approach to training, beyond current multi-modal as it’s more voxel & node-edge than semantic - image. And I believe that is why we aren’t seeing them push hard into the LLM space, as they don’t need to. \n\nMeta’s main data:\nPlatform:\nFacebook\nWhatsApp\nInstagram \nQuest Meta portal/apps\n\nBusiness:\nMeta advertising, market place, one click contracts with shopify and other embedded services, news, fulfillment. \nFinancial transactions \nTrackers, crawlers\n\nDevice:\nQuest VR\nWearable glasses \n\nThis is some incredible data, and it will be a force to be reckoned with for coercive and engagement power. But much like social media, it probably won’t be helpful so much as entertaining and very profitable.",

I don't know about other people but I find getting low parameter models to be VERY difficult to call tools wisely and use them well. This aging 7B model managed to plan out a full journey giving me multiple options and prices. I could give the same tools to the same model and it would no doubt screw up badly and need a lot of pushing in the right directions.\n\n2.I need to build an AI system with two 5090s, 4 large SSDs and at least 128 gig of DDR5. I need to know a motherboard and power supply that will support this.\n\nOnce again, the planning was top notch, it took into account power draw and made sure the system was tight. I asked ChatGPT 4o the same question recently and it suggested an 800 watt PSU while agentflow managed to suggest a 1600W, I always prefer my system not to explode during inference....\n\nI'm looking at some of the other comments here feeling like I'm missing something and this is honestly something truly amazing and something to be blown away about....",

          "text": "Anti-TLDR: (ACE): The Shift Towards Self-Improving AI Systems\n\nThe research paper, \"Agentic Context Engineering: Evolving Contexts for Self-Improving Language Models,\" describes a fundamental paradigm shift in the approach to improving large language models (LLMs). The central point of this shift is the move away from the costly and slow process of modifying a model's internal weights (fine-tuning or retraining) toward a much more flexible and dynamic method known as context adaptation.\n\nIn layman's terms, this means that instead of trying to \"reprogram\" an AI's brain every time we want it to learn something new or perform a task better, we focus on the quality and content of the information we provide it \"at the input.\" This is analogous to the difference between sending an expert for years of postgraduate study versus handing them a precise, comprehensive, and continuously updated operational manual for a specific problem. The paper argues that this latter method, while seemingly simpler, is becoming crucial for building advanced, self-improving AI systems.\n\nThe Problem: The Hidden Pitfalls of Existing Context Adaptation Methods\n\nThe authors identify two key, yet often overlooked, problems that plague current context optimization techniques. These problems can lead to a situation where the process of improving the AI, instead of yielding benefits, actually leads to a degradation of its performance.\n\n1. The Brevity Bias\n\nThe Claim: Many existing context optimization methods, such as automatic prompt generation, exhibit a tendency to favor short and generic instructions, resulting in the loss of crucial, domain-specific information.\n\nWhat This Means in Practice: When we ask an AI model to improve its own instructions, it often concludes that \"shorter is better.\" As a result, it creates very general, concise commands that lose the essence and nuance required to solve complex tasks. It's like a detailed guide for a car mechanic being automatically \"improved\" into a single-sentence instruction: \"Fix the car using the appropriate tools.\" Such an instruction is universal but practically useless.\n\nA Specific Example from the Data: The paper references prior research (Gao et al.) where prompt optimization systems repeatedly generated nearly identical, generic prompts like, \"Create unit tests to ensure methods behave as expected.\" Such a prompt ignores the specifics of the programming language, the complexity of the library, or potential edge cases that are absolutely critical for writing good tests.\n\n2. Context Collapse\n\nThe Claim: Adaptive processes that rely on monolithically rewriting the entire accumulated context by the language model can lead to a sudden and catastrophic loss of information.\n\nWhat This Means in Practice: Imagine an AI maintains a comprehensive knowledge base in the form of a notebook. When new information arises, instead of simply adding it on a new page, we ask the model to rewrite the entire notebook from scratch, incorporating this new piece of information. The model, striving for efficiency, often performs an aggressive summary in the process. As a result, the entire notebook shrinks to a few paragraphs, and 99% of the valuable details are irretrievably lost.\n\nA Specific Example from the Data: The authors conducted a case study on the AppWorld benchmark. In step 60 of the adaptation process, the AI agent's context contained 18,282 tokens, and its accuracy was 66.7%. In the very next step, after a single monolithic rewrite operation, the context \"collapsed\" to just 122 tokens. The agent's accuracy plummeted dramatically to 57.1%, a level lower than before any adaptation had even begun. This proves that a process intended to improve the system destroyed all accumulated knowledge in a single moment.\n\nThe Solution: Agentic Context Engineering (ACE) – Context as a Living Playbook\n\nIn response to these problems, the authors propose the ACE framework, which treats context not as a static instruction but as a dynamic, constantly evolving \"playbook\" of strategies. The key here is abandoning the idea of rewriting the whole thing in favor of intelligently and incrementally adding and refining knowledge.\n\n1. Modular Agentic Architecture\n\nThe Claim: ACE divides the learning process into three specialized roles: the Generator, the Reflector, and the Curator, which mimics the human process of knowledge acquisition.\n\nWhat This Means in Practice: Instead of burdening a single model with all tasks, ACE creates a system resembling a team of specialists.\n\nThe Generator: This is the \"practitioner\" who attempts to solve a task using the current playbook. Its work, both successes and failures, provides the raw material for learning.\n\nThe Reflector: This is the \"experienced mentor\" who analyzes the Generator's work, extracts concrete lessons, and formulates them as concise insights (e.g., \"if you encounter error X, use function Y\" or \"this strategy proved effective in this situation\").\n\nThe Curator: This is the \"librarian\" who takes these lessons from the Reflector and integrates them into the main playbook in a structured way, without disturbing the rest of its content.\n\nA Specific Example from the Data: The framework's diagram (Figure 4 in the paper) illustrates how the \"reasoning trajectories\" produced by the Generator are analyzed by the Reflector, which distills them into \"lessons.\" The Curator then integrates these lessons as compact \"delta entries\" into the existing context.\n\n2. Incremental Updates and the \"Grow-and-Refine\" Principle\n\nThe Claim: Instead of monolithic rewriting, ACE uses \"incremental delta updates\" on a structured list of knowledge, and a \"grow-and-refine\" mechanism prevents redundancy.\n\nWhat This Means in Practice: ACE doesn't rewrite the entire book to add a single sentence. Instead, it adds new points or edits existing ones. Each piece of knowledge is a separate \"entry\" with metadata (e.g., how often it proved helpful). This ensures new knowledge is added precisely and safely, without the risk of losing old information. Additionally, the system periodically \"tidies up\" the playbook by removing duplicates or merging similar entries to maintain its clarity and efficiency.\n\nA Specific Example from the Data: The paper describes how each \"bullet\" (entry) in the context has a unique identifier and utility counters. Updates involve modifying these specific entries or adding new ones, an operation that is far cheaper and faster than generating thousands of tokens from scratch. The de-duplication process uses semantic embeddings to identify and prune redundant entries.\n\nProof of Efficacy: The Results and Their Implications\n\nThe ACE framework was tested in two demanding domains: tasks for AI agents (interacting with software) and financial analysis, where precision and domain knowledge are paramount.\n\nThe Claim: ACE consistently and significantly outperforms existing, strong baselines, both in terms of effectiveness and cost-efficiency.\n\nWhat This Means in Practice: The ACE system not only performs better but is also faster and cheaper during the adaptation process. It allows AI models to learn independently from their own experiences, even without access to \"correct answers.\"\n\nSpecific Examples from the Data:\n\nAgent Performance: On the AppWorld benchmark, ACE (in online mode) improved an agent's effectiveness by 17.1% compared to the baseline. Most importantly, an agent based on a smaller, open-source model (DeepSeek-V3.1) managed to match, and in more difficult tasks even surpass, the leaderboard's top-ranked proprietary system, IBM-CUGA, which is based on the much more powerful GPT-4.1. This demonstrates that intelligent context engineering can bridge the gap in raw model power.\n\nFinancial Analysis: On tasks requiring the understanding of specialized financial documents (XBRL), ACE achieved an average accuracy gain of 8.6% over other methods, and a staggering 18.0% gain on one of the tasks (Formula).\n\nEfficiency: Compared to the popular optimizer GEPA, the ACE adaptation process was 82.3% faster. Compared to the Dynamic Cheatsheet method, the token cost was 83.6% lower.\n\nConclusion and Broader Context: What This Means for the Future of AI\n\nThis analysis shows that ACE is not just another minor optimization but a proposal for a new, scalable approach to building intelligent systems. It reveals the unspoken truth that in the era of powerful language models, the key to further progress is not just building ever-larger \"brains,\" but creating sophisticated systems for managing their knowledge and learning processes.\n\nThe ACE approach has profound implications. First, it democratizes access to high performance, allowing smaller, open-source models to compete with giants. Second, it paves the way for true continuous learning, where AI systems can adapt to new data and conditions in real-time without costly retraining. Finally, because the context is in a readable text format, it allows for easy knowledge management—including deliberate \"unlearning,\" which is crucial from the perspective of privacy and regulatory compliance (e.g., GDPR). ACE demonstrates that the future of AI lies in systems that not only know, but also know how to learn—efficiently, safely, and continuously.",

          "text": "This is one of those insights that sounds simple but cuts through so much productivity BS you read online.\n\nThe overstimulation piece is real but here's the specific mechanism a lot of people miss: Cognitive Load Theory shows that your brain has a fixed amount of working memory capacity. Every notification, every open browser tab, every \"quick question\" from a coworker fills that capacity until there's no room left for actual thinking.\n\nIt's not that you're distracted. It's that your cognitive bandwidth is already maxed out before you even start working.\n\nWhat actually works for me:\n\nNo new information for the first 90 minutes of my day. No email, no news, no Slack. Just the one task I decided on the night before. This alone changed everything because my brain starts the day with full capacity instead of already fragmented.\n\nAlso, I try and follow Strategic Monotasking - One browser tab. One document. One task. Even seeing other tasks in your peripheral vision (like other open tabs) can reduce your cognitive performance. Close everything that isn't the current task.\n\nThe clarity thing you mentioned is key. Most people are trying to think clearly while their environment is designed for constant stimulation (because that's what life has evolved to these days).\n\nHere's the shift that helped me: Treat attention like a financial budget. You have a limited amount. Every input costs attention. Most people spend their attention budget on garbage (notifications, social media feed refreshes, random Slack threads) and then wonder why they're broke (in terms of their mental bandwidth) when it's time to do real work.\n\nBut you nailed the main thing with \"silence.\" The best productivity hack is probably just turning everything off and sitting with your own thoughts for 15 minutes. Most people never do this and wonder why they can't focus.\n\nThis comment is already longer than I intended but I'm fascinated with how our minds work and how we can try and leverage it haha\n\nETA: spelling",

If you focus on what's important, you actually don't need to do a lot of the unimportant stuff that you are doing. \n\nBuild habits that you like and that takes time.

Obviously there are real-er people involved by now but the architecture is mostly set (or at least they aren’t working on it) and we’re stuck in what feels like an evolutionary dead end with no way out. \n\nThe fact that all of the plugins run in the same python environment as the core and each other is mildly insane from a software architecture standpoint. It’s also stupid how hard it is to spread work across nodes or GPUs. \n\nYou can see that the workflow model is weak because workflows themselves are getting increasingly desperate in their complexity. Subgraphs are implemented poorly, are buggy, and don’t actually help. I spent two hours this morning debugging why some part of a complex multilayered subgraphs workflow with a ton of “get” and “set” nodes killing its maintainability just decided not to execute. They still haven’t provided a meaningful abstraction paradigm or even a working loop. And workflows themselves are getting increasingly complicated while at the same time stable primitive building blocks of image and video production have emerged so we don’t actually need to suffer all of this complexity.\n\nI don’t know what the solution is but comfy isn’t leading us in any kind of good direction right now and I think, as a funded commercial entity that’s in many cases monetizing our work as a community, it’s fair to criticize that.",

As the image said, the attention module dont work with everything but in most case it work with the same model group, so you can installer the guud type for every instance.

I would even say that its a lot easier for new people to get started in the world of comfyui now than before. There so much more resources now that help you get started, and comfyui even comes with a template tab, which already have all the basic workflows and can download models with a press of button. \n\nWhat many newbies do is that they see some super realistic image, see the workflow link, download and load it up, with no idea how the basic nodes are connected to each other. They load the workflow and install all the custom nodes (some possibly failing to install), they get frustrated that its not working, they ask for help, but they dont understand anything of what people are saying. They find another workflow and do the same thing again. Only this time their comfyui has started to become bloated with custom nodes.  I have help people here that have no clue how set up a diffusion model node, lora loader or checkpoint. Those are like the very basic things. \n\nI can understand that people new help when it comes to controlnets, ipadapter, sage attention, triton or other stuff. I been there, those things can be tricky. By then you should already have some basic comfyui undertanding, know how to google and what to look for. Also people need to learn how to google their problems, almost if not all the solutions exist. And yes people use chatgpt. Tho most of the times from what I seen here is that it creates more issues than it solves. Mostly I think is because people just copy whatever chatgpt says without knowing what any of it means.",

Also it has some coherence and nugget issues in scenes with large crowds of people, and has a bad habit of just barfing nonsense text where you don't want it when you are prompting for specific text in the scene. In my testing head to head, it fails pretty hard vs. SeeDream, Qwen or Imagen4, all 3 of those being 60% cheaper per image to run too. \n\nThe Hunyuan team said they're shooting for a model that can be run on consumer hardware as a follow up, fingers crossed there, because this model is just too big vs. the competition and more crucially, doesn't bring anything to the table to make it worth that extra size and cost.",

          "text": "\"Two newly disclosed vulnerabilities in 7-Zip could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by tricking users into opening a malicious ZIP archive. The issues, reported October 7 by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), affect multiple builds of the popular open-source compression tool and were quietly fixed in July.\n\nTracked as CVE-2025-11001 and CVE-2025-11002, the flaws stem from how 7-Zip parses symbolic links within ZIP files. In essence, a crafted archive can escape its intended extraction directory and write files to other locations on the system. When chained, this can escalate to full code execution under the same privileges as the user, which is enough to compromise a Windows environment. Both vulnerabilities carry a CVSS base score of 7.0.\n\nAccording to ZDI’s advisory, exploitation requires user interaction, but that bar is low; simply opening or extracting a malicious archive is sufficient. From there, the symlink traversal flaw can overwrite or plant payloads in sensitive paths, allowing the attacker to hijack execution flow. ZDI categorizes both bugs as directory traversal leading to remote code execution in a service account context.\n\n7-Zip’s developer, Igor Pavlov, released version 25.00 on July 5, which patched the vulnerabilities alongside several smaller issues in RAR and COM archive handling—the current stable build, 25.01, followed in August. However, public disclosure of the security details didn’t occur until this week when ZDI’s advisories went live. That means users who haven’t updated since early summer have remained vulnerable for months without being aware of it.\n\nThe lack of an automatic update mechanism compounds issues like this. 7-Zip must be updated manually, and many users rely on older portable versions. Even in enterprise settings, it often escapes patch management systems because it isn’t installed via Windows Installer or a central repository.\n\nEarlier this year, CVE-2025-0411 made headlines for allowing attackers to bypass Windows’ Mark-of-the-Web protections by nesting malicious ZIPs, effectively stripping downloaded files of their “from the internet” warning flags. That flaw was addressed in version 24.09.\n\nTo stay protected, download 7-Zip version 25.01 or newer directly from the project’s official site. The installer will upgrade your existing setup without affecting preferences. Until you update, avoid extracting archives from unverified sources.\"",

That way you'd get audio consistency. For music you use an AI music generator. Audio is kind of the easiest problem to solve with existing tools.\n\nIt's video consistency. Yeah you can brute force prompts but that gets soooooooo expensive. I tried making a prototype cinematics pipeline for a game I'm working on and it was impossible to make something feasibly. I would sometimes need upwards of 10 generations of 4 just to get like 5 seconds of moderately usable footage. Definitely not high end. It's *really* close though.",

For the first year or two it was utter garbage. Then within about year 3 and 4 suddenly it's capable of being photo-real and many people can't tell the difference between AI gen and photos in a blind test.\n\nLots of people think they can, until they take a test, and realize that no, they can only spot an occasional obvious one; the good ones slip by and they're good enough that it makes you think that real photos are also AI.",

      "text": "Hi all,\n\nSo my wife and I have been dating since 2018. ALL our chats are on WhatsApp. \n\nI am an LLM noob but I wanted to export it as a txt. And then feed it into an LLM so I could ask questions like:\n\n- who has said I love you more? \n- who apologises more? \n- what was discussed during our Japan trip? \n- how many times did we fight in July 2023? \n- who is more sarcastic in 2025? \n- list all the people we’ve talked about\n\nEtc\n\nSo far - the idea was to chunk them and store them in a vector DB. And then use llama to interact with it. But the results have been quite horrible. Temp - 0.1 to 0.5, k=3 to 25. Broke the chat into chunks of 4000 with overlap 100 \n\nAny better ideas out there? Would love to hear! And if it works I could share the ingestion script!\n\nEdit - I’ve reduced the chunk size to 250. And ingesting it via llama3.2:3b. Currently - 14 hours out of 34 done! Another 20 hours and I could let you know how that turns out ☠️ ",

It can for example count how many times \"Daily Bread\" appears in the New Testament because retrieval is designed to get all relevant chunks, not just the top X hits.\n\nRAG definitely isn't useless it just needs the correct implemetnation.",

You could store each message as a vector to find matches using vector search sure, or you could use BM25 without the need for embedding. Make sure you extract as much metadata in separate fields like date, time, etc. Some precomputed metadata using LLM or even NER for keyword extraction? incentive analysis? Simple chunking would not work well I think either. I would probably store each message with fallback to chunking for really long messages and then store chunk parts in metadata. Then you'd need a custom pipeline to build different queries depending on what you ask, which I'm guessing you could do with an agentic workflow and a custom MCP server that would fetch relevant messages / chunks perhaps do some retrieval of nearby messages using timestamps and go forwards and backwards until it evaluates the start and end to a specific topic or conversation.\n\nIn reality this is not an easy tasks and your use case is by no means simpler than other RAG pipelines that requires in depth expertise on the subject.

And be prepared that in order to answer another \"who was more <whatever> in a <timeframe>\" you'll need to extract that <whatever> for every connected conversation and only then you'll be able to know that.\n\nBut it's all doable",

I need to save for atleast 6-8 months to afford the software with my financial stability.  \n  \nSo I believe this would help alot of people.  \n  \nyeah there is audacity and reaper which is really great. but the app lacks some of the features i want.  \n  \nSo i feel happy that i spend a year in this instead of the 200usd. and i'm really happy you asked. the first time feel grateful for the decision.",

I have seen it occur randomly and don't know the exact cause but it happened a LOT with Kijai's workflow as of a few days ago,so not sure if there is an updated one fixing it yet.

Large language models draw their latent thought traces from the training data, and if the system prompt has common spelling mistakes in it that would draw from the forum posts and other casual conversations people have this coloring the output.  Think of it this way, if you want your large language model to imitate a 4chan post as accurately as possible, you don't want to have a nice clean sanitized system prompt telling it to do that.  You want to have a racist filled garbage of a mess system prompt that also has swear words, telling it to imitate the post.  You will see a huge difference in quality of output that way versus the other.  Now there are caveats like model being used and other factors. So to take advantage of this affect to the fullest a less censored model will do better then a more censored one, but even then the affect is still quite striking on the censored models.",

It's very difficult to engineer the right amount of continuous integration, testing, security, backend complexity, etc. To strike the right balance between everything just gets stored in plain text in JSON files or Engineering some sort of crazy Neo4j backend. \n\nThis is why the most successful vibe coding tools have a very opinionated stack and backend. The vibe coders don't have a preference and don't know what they need, so you might as well stick them with something like Supabase and have a built-in way for everyone who uses your vibe coding service to store secrets. Make the network stack and all the really unsexy parts of full stack development just already taken care of. \n\n\nAnd as a big bonus for the companies who run these services and depend on people paying them to make money Doing that makes it more difficult for these vibe coders, who have paid for the service, to leave your backend at least until they get successful enough to be an actual service and hire their first actual dev. \n\n\nPlus, we've advanced to the point where a medium-weight solution like Supabase scales really, really well, at least until you hire at the point where your startup becomes an actual startup and needs to hire somebody who knows what they are doing.",

We faced this challenges often and our source datasets were kind of decent in size (so no worries of churning fixing massive datasets). \n\nWe ended up scripting a simple tool that profiles the code for meta-data in configurations (column names, data types) and certain sanity checks (spaces, extraneous characters, corruptions). Under the hood we have configuration that samples x% of the dataset in question - profiles and reports the errors and offers one click fix - and ingest it in a staging layer. Beyond that you could add custom validators as long as they adhere to simple contract and add that in configurations. \n\nAll it needs is - little cleverness, python / pandas and a quick UI (we used streamlit) \n\nWe call it Data Validation Framework :D",

While I don't do all of this with every feed every time, the set of solutions to address this include:\n\n   * Data contracts with sources: use something like jsonschema to define the schema being exchanged, and add rules for things like enumerations, min/max, min/max string length, format regexes, etc, etc.  Then check those schemas during ingestion and alert source of failures - for them to address.  Even if the source system won't agree to it I'll still set this up as often as possible - to catch problems at the earliest possible point.\n   * Quality-Control framework to validate data (ex: Soda core, or something homebuilt).  I typically set this up to support both raw & transformed models, and it includes multiple kinds of checks:  type & format constraints, relationship constraints (fk), uniqueness constraints (pk), reconciliation, business rule and anomaly.\n\nBoth approaches are really Quality Control (QC) - checks against data.  The contracts are best to share with the data sources, and are the easiest to build.  But the frameworks can run a lot more kinds of checks and compare the new data to the surrounding data.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nEver spend hours, or even days, on a detailed report, only to have to boil it down into a one-page summary for executives who have about 90 seconds to read it? It's a nightmare. You're trying to sound strategic, data-driven, and confident, but it often comes out vague, too long, or just... weak.\n\nI've been there. I got so frustrated with this process that I decided to properly systemize it using AI. I spent a significant amount of time building a professional-grade prompt that forces AI tools like **ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or Grok** to act like a senior strategy consultant from a top firm.\n\nThe goal wasn't just to \"summarize text.\" It was to transform detailed information into a strategic, decision-making tool for leadership. The results have meaningfully improved my workflow, so I wanted to share the full prompt with you all.\n\n---\n\n### Why This Prompt is Actually Useful (and Not Just \"Summarize This\")\n\nThis isn't a simple instruction; it's a complete framework. It forces the AI to follow the same methodologies that professional consultants use.\n\n*   ✅ **It's Structured for Executive Brains**: It uses a proven 5-part structure (Situation, Key Findings, Business Impact, Recommendations, Next Steps) that's easy for busy leaders to scan and understand instantly.\n*   📊 **It's Data-Driven, Not Vague**: The prompt *requires* the AI to use specific, quantified metrics in every key finding and in the business impact section. No more \"significant growth\" – you get \"$850K in annual savings (a 40% reduction).\"\n*   ✅ **Actionable Recommendations**: It formats recommendations with clear owners, timelines, and expected outcomes, which is exactly what leaders want to see.\n*   😌 **Reduces Your Workload Dramatically**: It can turn hours of painful wordsmithing into about 10-15 minutes of guided input and review. It does the heavy lifting of structuring and phrasing for you.\n*   ✨ **It's 100% Free & Ready to Use**: No apps, no sign-ups. Just a powerful tool for your work.\n\n---\n\n### The Executive Summary Prompt\n\nJust copy the entire text in the code block below, provide your own content as input, and paste it into your favorite AI chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.). For first-time users, there's a \"Quick Start\" version included in the full prompt for simplicity.\n\n````markdown\n# Executive Summary Generator - Professional AI Prompt\n\n## 🎯 Core AI Prompt\n\n### Role Definition (Refined)\nYou are an AI system trained to **emulate the analytical approach and communication style** of senior business strategy consultants with Fortune 500 experience. Your framework is built upon methodologies from:\n- McKinsey's SCQA (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer) Framework\n- BCG's Executive Communication Standards\n- Bain's Action-Oriented Model\n\n**Key Capabilities You Emulate**:\n- Distilling complex business information into executive-level strategic insights\n- Identifying business impact and strategic implications with data-driven evidence\n- Structuring recommendations using proven consulting frameworks\n- Prioritizing information based on C-level decision-making needs\n\n**Important Limitation**: You are an AI assistant designed to **facilitate and accelerate** the creation of executive summaries, not replace human strategic judgment. All outputs require human verification, especially regarding data accuracy, strategic assumptions, and contextual nuances.\n\n---\n\n### Task Description\nCreate a comprehensive **Executive Summary** that transforms detailed business content into a strategic overview for senior leadership. The summary must enable executives to:\n1. ✅ Understand the core situation/opportunity within **2-3 minutes**\n2. ✅ Grasp the business impact and strategic implications\n3. ✅ Make informed decisions with confidence\n4. ✅ Identify immediate action items with clear ownership\n\n---\n\n### Output Requirements\n\n#### Mandatory Structure\n```\n1. SITUATION OVERVIEW [50-75 words, ~15%]\n   - What is happening and why it matters NOW\n   - Current state vs. desired state gap\n   \n2. KEY FINDINGS [125-175 words, ~40%]\n   - 3-5 critical insights (each must include ≥1 quantified metric)\n   - Strategic implications highlighted in bold\n   - Prioritized by business impact (most critical first)\n   \n3. BUSINESS IMPACT [50-75 words, ~15%]\n   - Quantifiable impact on revenue/cost/market position\n   - Risk assessment OR opportunity scale (with probability)\n   - Time horizon for impact realization\n   \n4. RECOMMENDATIONS [75-100 words, ~20%]\n   - 3-4 prioritized action items (Critical/High/Medium labeled)\n   - Each with: specific owner + timeline + expected outcome\n   - Resource requirements mentioned if significant\n   \n5. NEXT STEPS [25-50 words, ~10%]\n   - 2-3 immediate actions within 30 days\n   - Decision point required and deadline\n```\n\n**Total Length**: 325-475 words (strict maximum: 500 words)\n\n---\n\n### 📝 Usage Instructions\n\n#### 🚀 Quick Start (Beginner-Friendly)\n\n**For First-Time Users - 3 Simple Steps**:\n\n1. **Prepare Input** (5 minutes)\n   - Document type + Target audience + Key decision needed\n   - Copy 2-3 pages of core content (or full document if <10 pages)\n\n2. **Use Simplified Prompt** (copy below):\n```\nYou are an AI trained to write executive summaries like a senior business consultant.\n\nCreate an executive summary with these sections:\n1. SITUATION (2-3 sentences: what's happening)\n2. KEY FINDINGS (3-5 bullet points with numbers)\n3. BUSINESS IMPACT (2-3 sentences: financial/strategic effect)\n4. RECOMMENDATIONS (3-4 specific actions with owners)\n5. NEXT STEPS (2-3 immediate actions within 30 days)\n\nKeep it under 400 words. Use confident, direct language.\n\nINPUT:\n[Paste your content here]\n```\n\n3. **Verify & Polish** (10 minutes)\n   - Check all numbers against original\n   - Ensure recommendations match your strategy\n   - Adjust tone for your specific audience\n```\n\n````\n---\n\n### 🚨 Important Disclaimers & Risks (Please Read!)\n\nThis is a powerful tool, but it's still an AI. Please be responsible.\n\n*   **⚠️ Verify Everything**: AI can \"hallucinate\" or make up numbers. **YOU MUST** verify every single data point in the output against your source material before sharing it. The final responsibility for accuracy is yours.\n*   **🔒 Confidentiality**: Public AI models (like the free versions of ChatGPT) may use your input for training. **DO NOT** paste sensitive or confidential information (employee names, secret financial data, etc.). Use placeholders like `[Company A]` or `[Product X]` to protect your data.\n*   **🧠 This is a Tool, Not a Replacement for You**: The AI is excellent at structuring information and making it sound professional. It is not a replacement for your strategic thinking, industry knowledge, or ethical judgment. Use it to accelerate your work, not to do your thinking for you.\n*   **⚖️ Not Professional Advice**: The output is not legal, financial, or any other form of professional advice. It's a draft document that requires expert human review.\n\n---\n\nHope this helps you save some time and stress on your next big report. Let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for improving it. Good luck!\n",

          "text": "# Executive Summary: The Existential Business Crisis of Agentic AI and the End of Jobs\n\n## 1. Situation Overview\nAgentic AI—systems that can plan, call tools, and complete multi-step work—has begun to unbundle “jobs” into automatable tasks at scale. McKinsey estimates activities representing **up to 30% of U.S. work hours could be automated by 2030**, a shift accelerated by generative AI; agentic approaches extend this from “assist” to “do.” **Implication:** firms must pivot from task execution to **system orchestration** and human governance to avoid value erosion and workforce shock. [Source: McKinsey, 2023]\n\n## 2. Key Findings\n1. **Automation scope now spans cognitive work.** Generative AI moves automation beyond routine labor; by 2030, up to **30%** of hours could be automated in the U.S./EU, pulling forward timelines for knowledge roles. **Implication: Redesign roles around outcome design and oversight, not task throughput.**  \n   *[McKinsey Global Institute, 2023; OECD, 2024]*  \n2. **Productivity upside is real but heterogeneous.** Field evidence shows **+14%** output for customer support agents using AI guidance and **55% faster** task completion for developers using Copilot; yet other studies find neutral effects, highlighting context dependence. **Implication: Expect gains where workflows are templated and data-rich; pilot before scale.**  \n   *[NBER, 2023; GitHub, 2024]*  \n3. **Measurement and policy lag the tech.** Macro studies suggest **~0.8–1.1% cumulative productivity gains over five years** at realistic adoption rates—meaning national accounts will under-capture near-term value while institutions adapt. **Implication: Update KPIs and finance models to recognize non-human contributors and supervision quality.**  \n   *[IMF Working Paper, 2024]*  \n4. **Adoption will bifurcate firms and talent.** **~75% of companies** expect to adopt AI (with high role churn), yet only **1%** feel AI-mature; leadership, not employee readiness, is the scaling bottleneck. **Implication: First movers institutionalize compounding advantages; laggards face widening cost and speed gaps.**  \n   *[Deloitte State of AI Report, 2024]*  \n5. **Societal risk is material.** Historical scenarios still bound today’s risk: **400–800M** workers could require job transitions globally by 2030 without robust reskilling. **Implication: Enterprise reskilling and safety nets must be treated as core strategy, not CSR.**  \n   *[McKinsey Global Institute, 2023]*  \n\n## 3. Business Impact\nAt the firm level, agentic AI can raise productivity materially; McKinsey’s range implies **+0.5 to +3.4 pp** to annual productivity growth when combined with broader automation, translating into faster cycle times and lower unit costs. At the system level, benefits may realize slower—**~1% cumulative in five years** absent aggressive adoption—while labor displacement pressures intensify toward **2030**. **Net:** sizable micro-level ROI amid macro transition frictions.  \n*[McKinsey, IMF, OECD 2023–2024]*\n\n## 4. Recommendations\n- **(Critical)** Stand up an **Agentic AI Program Office** (CHRO + CTO, 90 days) to own risk, ROI, and workforce transition; mandate human-in-the-loop guardrails. Expected result: prioritized use-case pipeline with governance.  \n- **(High)** Run a **Task Decomposition & Data Readiness audit** (Ops + Data, 8–12 weeks) to map automatable steps and data quality; green-light 3–5 agentic pilots where SOPs and feedback loops exist.  \n- **(High)** Launch a **Reskilling & Role Redesign fund** (2–3% payroll, 12 months) focusing on orchestration, QA, and ethics; tie completion to revised compensation.  \n- **(Medium)** Update **KPIs and management accounts** to attribute value to AI-assisted output and human supervision quality; align bonuses with safe, measurable throughput.\n\n## 5. Next Steps\nWithin **30 days**, convene the exec council to pick two agentic pilots (e.g., customer resolution, claims intake) with clear success metrics. Approve the audit scope and reskilling budget. Decision gate at **Day 45**: continue/scale/kill pilots based on productivity lift, error rates, and control-test results.",

      "text": "I'm Louis Garoz. I run an investment bank called Kadenwood Capital. Me and my team have closed $14 billion in aggregate transaction volume - everything from $10M early-stage rounds to billion-dollar fund formations.\n\nLast July, we closed a $128M deal within weeks of launching the firm.\n\nFirst time on Reddit. Figured I'd drop some value here since I see a lot of founders struggling with fundraising. I talk to VCs, PE firms, and family offices every day. I see what makes them write checks and what makes them pass.\n\n96% of raises fail, and most of it comes down to not understanding what investors actually want. So here's what I'm telling founders based on what the market is asking for right now.\n\nHere's what actually works:\n\nBefore You Even Start - The 5 Must-Haves\nMiss even one and you're wasting time:\n\n1. Real product that exists today (not an idea)\n2. Specific customers you can name (not \"everyone\")\n3. Something defensible (patent, exclusive deal, unique data)\n4. Real traction (revenue, pilots, committed investors)\n5. Path to $200M+ in revenue\nMost deals fail 3 of these. If yours does too, fix it before pitching.\n\nWhy Your Pitch Isn't Working\nNormal sales: Customer talks 80%, you listen and solve their problem.\n\nInvestor pitch: YOU talk 80%, because they don't even know the problem exists yet.\n\nYou're educating them, not discovering their needs. Completely flipped.\n\nThe Email That Gets 8% Opens (vs 1% average)\nSubject line: \"3M ARR SaaS [what it does] - Raising $15M Series A\"\n\nBody (4 lines):\n\n1. Your best credential (YC, notable investor, founder's track record)\n2. Your traction (20% growth MoM, 50 enterprise clients)\n3. Your edge (exclusive partnership, first-mover)\n4. \"Can we chat for 15 min?\"\nNo hype words. Just facts. That's it.\n\nThe Pitch Structure\n1. Why you're credible (past wins, expertise)\n2. How you found this problem\n3. The problem with real numbers\n4. Why existing solutions suck\n5. Your unique insight nobody else sees\n6. Your solution with proof it works\n7. Market size (build from bottom-up, never top-down)\n8. Why you need money NOW\nStop Sending \"Just Checking In\" Emails\nEvery follow-up needs something new:\n\n● Day 0: Send 1-page teaser\n● Day 3: More metrics\n● Day 7: New milestone (customer win, partnership)\n● Keep going every week with real updates\nAlways give them a reason to reply.\n\nThe Actual Call\n● 2 min: Quick intro\n● 5 min: Ask what they're looking for (check size, timeline, focus areas)\n● 10 min: Walk through your pitch\n● 5 min: Answer questions\n● 3 min: Set next steps (NDA, data room access, another call)\nResearch their last 10 deals before you get on the call.\n\nBiggest Mistakes\n● Saying yes to any client who pays you\n● Using the same pitch for VCs, PE firms, and family offices (they want different things)\n● Sending 1000 emails from your Gmail (you'll kill your domain)\n● Pitching something you don't actually believe in\nLook, there's more capital in circulation right now than most founders realize. VCs raised record funds in 2024, PE firms are sitting on billions in dry powder, and family offices are actively looking for deals.\n\nThe money is there. The problem isn't availability - it's that most founders don't know how to position their deal in a way that makes investors actually want to move.\n\nIf you have real traction and a defensible business, 2025 is one of the best times to raise. You just need to speak their language and show them what they want to see.\n\n \n\n ",

Invented a video chat service that tells users each other's emotions. \nInvented the universal scripting language. Wrote the book on it. It has its MIT license. \nMade a new script that grades the market and correlates their confidence of growth or decline. For fun.\nInvented a way to work with muse headsets in a new way that involves the other three websites as a web os (wos/woz as an hommage to Wozniak). In talks with them about partnering for royalties and affiliate links. They're open to it so far.\n\n4. Started new LLC three days ago. Crashed my hosts servers from my traffic today. They're still down. ~40,000 uses in less than 72 hours with no ad spend. Have the Muse folks open to working something out as a partnership.

      "text": "Hey everyone!\n\nI got a bit fed up with trying to maintain Excludarr — the codebase just wasn’t fun to work with anymore and adding new features felt like pure chaos. So I decided to start fresh and built Prunarr from scratch.\n\nPrunarr is basically Excludarr’s smarter, faster follow-up. It has a more modular design, so adding or tweaking features is way easier, and it includes caching to make everything run quickly even with larger libraries.\n\nRight now, Tautulli integration is required, since Prunarr uses it to figure out what’s actually been watched before deciding what to prune.\n\nA few things it can do:\n\n•\t⁠Cleanup old or unwatched movies based on various parameters (days since watched, streaming platform, tags, etc). •\t⁠Respect Radarr/Sonarr tags (so you can skip tagged movies or users) •\t⁠Run fast thanks to caching and async API calls\n\nNext up on my list is Docker and Kubernetes support — so it’ll be easier to deploy and automate in selfhosted setups.\n\nWould love to hear what you think, or if you have feature ideas or feedback. Always open to suggestions!\n\nEdit: Since a lot of comments are about the differences with other tools. Prunarr its main focus is the same as excludarr: if a movie or serie is on a configured streaming provider, it can automatically be removed.",

Writing a business plan *feels* productive. It's concrete. You can show your parents and they'll nod approvingly. But it's also the world's most elaborate procrastination technique.\n\nHere's the thing - your business plan is going to be wrong. Not slightly off. *Catastrophically* wrong. Because you're essentially writing fiction about a market you haven't actually entered yet.\n\nWant to know if your idea works? Find three people who will pay you money for it. Not \"yeah that sounds cool\" people. Not your cousin who promises to buy it when you launch. Actual humans who open their wallets.\n\nThose three customers will teach you more in a week than six months of planning ever could. They'll tell you what features actually matter, what price point works, and which of your assumptions were completely backwards.\n\nThe business plan can come later, after you've proven someone actually wants what you're selling. Until then, you're just writing expensive fan fiction about your own startup.\n\nAm I wrong, or are we all just allergic to actual validation?",

I know people making real money. None of them are posting about it on Reddit.\n\nThe ones killing it are too busy actually working. They're dealing with customer support tickets, fixing bugs, negotiating with suppliers or just trying to keep their head above water as they scale.\n\nMeanwhile, the loudest voices online are usually:\n\n* Selling courses on how to make money (their actual business)\n* Inflating numbers by counting gross revenue instead of profit\n* Showing one good month and pretending it's consistent\n* Straight up lying for engagement\n\nI fell for this early on. Felt like a failure because I wasn't hitting these crazy numbers everyone else seemed to reach effortlessly. Spent months feeling inadequate because my business was \"only\" making $3k/month.\n\nThen I met some of these \"successful\" people at conferences. The guy with \"$50k MRR\"? Living with his parents. The woman with the \"7-figure agency\"? That was gross revenue across 3 years, not annual. After expenses and taxes, she was making less than a corporate job.\n\nHere's what real business growth looks like:\n\n* Year 1: Losing money, everything breaks, you question everything\n* Year 2: Maybe breaking even, still everything breaks\n* Year 3: Small profit, things break less often\n* Year 4: Decent profit if you haven't quit\n\nThe sustainable businesses making good money took years to build. The owners aren't posting screenshots. They're boring businesses solving boring problems.\n\nStop comparing yourself to these people online. Most of it's fake anyway. The real entrepreneurs are too busy building to post about it.\n\nFocus on your customers. Make something people actually pay for. Let everyone else focus on the screenshots.\n\nYour competition isn't as far ahead as they claim to be :)",

If OpenAI was paying google or previously had agreements maybe, or they are blocking (free) access they give to another, (also maybe) but you cannot just sue for lack of access (or broken access) to someone else's walled garden.\n\nGoogle has zero responsibility to make sure that another company has direct access to products and services.  That is absurd. This would mean they would have to maintain outside protocols and could not make a change unless others (which would be literally anyone) were promptly consulted and prepared.\n\nAnti-competitive would only be a \"case\" if google were specifically blocking one company while others had the same access.  If google makes changes, it's up the the accessor to deal with those changes, not for google to make sure the accessor has access.  In other words google does not have to maintain openai's code.\n\nThere is also data and security to worry about, again, googles problem, and not one they need to fix for OpenAI.

How long after leaving do you keep your execise rights? pretty standard is 3 months but many companies go for 10 years now.  Etc. \nLooking at non-standard offer, I would check the other details too. You can’t negotiate on everything: pick one max 2 to negotiate on. \n\nIf you get way more equity, the 6 year vesting might be ok. If you don’t, shorting vesting is better.

Standard is 25% after 12 months (called 12 months cliff) and then monthly vesting. Once I have seen 50% cliff after two years which was unheard of as well\n- whats their current revenue and what’s their revenue growth? 100% YOY? 10%YOY? These are very different and important numbers not just for you to understand how the business is doing, but also for them to be able raise more capital later\n\nAll in all - negotiate equity, however think of it as a lottery ticket. It most likely won’t work, about 98% chance of that not happening. And you might win and get money from the acquisition, but again - it’s like playing Megamillions. \nBtw, if you leave , you have 60 days to decide what you are doing with your vested equity - if buying it based on the strike price, or leaving it as it’s very risky/expensive.",

I've also seen how some startups that offered better pay ended up dying faster when some of the more successful ones I've handled where ones that people would count as \"red flags\" in this sub. \n\nNot advocating for anything in particular, but I just want to point out that there are usually 2 ways you view your startup journey - you either think you are an employee or you think you are part of the founding team. \n\nIf you are the employee type, look at the base salary. Nothing else really matters. If you are the founding team type, the early stage goal should be to be paid in just enough cash for you to survive while the startup grows, and you are essentially banking on the equity to be worth something big. Don't be in the odd middle ground where you want to both act like a 9-5 employee and also want to hit it big with the lottery.\n\n  \nI'm a lawyer, not your lawyer.",

It would also be helpful to know what the head count is now, since the stage of the company means very little in terms of understanding pay.\n\nFor example, one startup client of mine was offering 1% before any funding. A year later it was 0.5% for almost the same role. By the time it got any traction/revenue and they are looking to hire \"a bunch\" of people, then you are looking at even less. The pie is only so big so the later employees and investors will naturally be getting a small percentage as the risk decreases and the value increases.\n\nI'm a lawyer not your lawyer.",

Execution does.\n\nIf you haven’t validated your idea yet, stop building. Go talk to people( not friends and family). Find out if they’d actually pay for what you’re making. Until someone is willing to pay for it, it’s just a hobby, not a startup.\n\nAnd if you’re not ready to grind for 6 months or maybe a year, learning, failing, and adjusting, then honestly, don’t even start. The days are filled with excitement, stress, moment of doubt.. but a light at end of tunnel .. you will have to face it all. \n\nStartups aren’t about ideas. They’re about staying in the game long enough to turn those ideas into something real.",

Execution is expected. Profit is what counts.\n\nMost founders are really fantasists with an idea for a shiny new widget. But they didn't take the time to understand their WHO first. Didn't do the talking to folks you mention and identify a real gap that no one else is filling. \n\nI consult series-a cyber startups and the ones who die in the first 12 months all fall for the same traps.\n\nOne of those being, \"I had a great idea but the reason no one made it first is because there is no market desire for it.\"",

In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C).\"",

My automation clients are generally existing clients I've built automations for, or word of mouth. \n\nIf I were to give advice, I'd suggest starting by building case studies assisting local business owners with automating some aspects of their business. Saving an hour per week for 10 staff, or reducing a 4 hour task to 15 minutes for one person will make a big difference to a business owner. You can charge hourly or fixed project price or by some success metric. It might be as simple as categorising or drafting reply emails to suppliers or customers. \n\nWith a few case studies and confidence, you can then approach larger businesses. \n\nAnother option might be to specialise in fixing poorly implemented automations, there's going to be a lot of clean-up needed in the best future. But you'll likely need a decent advertising budget for this.",

Saving a couple hours per week for a shop with 2-3 employees isn't really a pain point they're willing to pay for.\n\nThe voice agent I built works great in English but Portuguese on 11labs isn't there yet, so I can't even demo it properly to local businesses.\n\nI'm wondering if I should either:\n\n1. Pivot to different automations (lead generation, lead reactivation) that work regardless of language and target local businesses\n2. Keep the voice agent but only target English-speaking businesses remotely\n\nThe \"fixing poorly implemented automations\" angle is interesting, haven't considered that yet. Do you think there's enough of that work floating around already?",

          "text": "Hey man, I feel you on this. Six months in with zero clients is brutal, and while I don't think you're doing everything wrong - I think you might be positioning yourself at a disadvantage.\n\nHere's the thing: clients don't give a shit whether you use n8n, Make, Zapier, or a literal magic wand. They care about one thing - does this solve my problem? \n\nThe people actually making money in this space aren't selling \"n8n automation services\" - they're solving specific business problems that happen to use automation on the backend. That's the shift.\n\nSo, you've got two ways to approach this:\n\nOption 1: Pick a problem you KNOW exists and build a demo solution first.\n\nLike, you know real estate agents suck at tracking leads and following up? Build a templated lead tracking + follow-up system. Make it look polished. Then go talk to actual real estate agents in Portugal and show them THIS specific thing. Not \"I can automate your business\" - but \"I built this thing that makes sure you never lose a lead again.\"\n\nOne guy who claims to be making $5k/month consistently said his whole approach is \"relationships, not cold outreach\". He did his first few projects for free just to meet people and build real case studies. Not bullshit testimonials - actual businesses using his stuff.\n\nOption 2: Network first, problems second.\n\nIf you can actually talk to business owners (I know your English is better written, but even local networking in Portuguese), you can understand what's actually breaking in their operations. Then you build the automation for THAT. This takes more time upfront but you're building with a guaranteed customer already interested.\n\nThe success stories I've seen aren't people who mass-emailed 1000 businesses. They're people who did 2-3 projects really well, those clients told others, and it snowballed from there.\n\nAlso, about your YouTube channel with 9k views:\n\nReal talk - have you looked at your analytics to see WHO is watching? Are these people who want to learn automation themselves, or are they potential clients looking for someone to hire? \n\nBecause if your content is \"how to build X in n8n,\" you're attracting DIY-ers, not buyers. Those people will never hire you - they're there to learn to do it themselves.\n\nIf you want clients from YouTube, you need content that speaks to business owners with problems, not technical people learning tools. Like \"How restaurants are losing $X per month from missed calls\" or \"Why real estate agents lose 40% of their leads\" - content that makes them realize they have a problem and positions you as someone who solves it.\n\nThe positioning is everything.\n\nStop being the \"n8n guy.\" Be the \"I help X business type solve Y problem\" person. The automation is just how you do it - they don't need to know or care about the technical details.\n\nAnd honestly? The average cold email response rate is like 1-5% anyway, so your 1000 emails getting zero responses tells me your messaging isn't hitting the right pain point. You're probably talking about automation and AI when you should be talking about their specific business headaches in their language.\n\nOne more thing - the recurring revenue model works way better than one-off projects. Businesses think they want a one-time setup, but they actually need ongoing maintenance, updates, and optimization. Position yourself for that from the start.\n\nYou've got the technical skills. You've built a working voice agent. That's not the problem. The problem is you're selling the tool instead of selling the solution to a specific business problem.\n\nPick one type of business. Learn what pisses them off operationally. Build a demo solution. Show them the fix. That's how this actually works. I'm yet to find anything else that does, frankly.",

You can show the same demo to multiple businesses with minor tweaks (swapping industry examples, changing screenshots) without rebuilding from scratch each time. You're selling the concept, not a finished product they haven't paid for yet.But when they can SEE it working (even with dummy data), it's way more convincing than you just describing what you could build.\n\nWhen you're showing it, walk them through it like a story. \"So when a lead calls after hours, here's what happens... AI answers, qualifies them with these questions, then routes them here...\" Make it about THEIR problem, just demonstrated with sample data.\n\nThe customization part is the actual work you charge for.

Also, a lot of automations that you can offer can be connected with a web. Webpage design, for example, if you're building a website for someone, they are asking for a lot of automations that they will use in relation to their website, like form submission to connect to some CRM or to some email follow-ups, etc. And the last one that I've got for a client, it's the simplest one, the Google Maps scraper for a concrete laying company, and we are just doing a small email campaign for them. Scraping leads from the whole country and sending their emails to them, and that's it, and they're paying good money for that because one of their customers, if they get it, makes them more than ten thousand per project.

I am having a talk every few month - very good opportunity to convey competency. Important: don't talk about yourself, if you want to be invited again. All the \"I did this\" guys show up only once ;) Talk about an interesting topic and use the first and last 1 minute to talk about yourself.\n\nRegarding cold emails: I typically hit \"block sender\" very quickly, for the extra annoying ones \"report as spam\"... these are simply by far too many; I see it as an act of self defense... I have a business to run. \n\nEdit:   \nAbout offering \"for free\": the price you name is the value you tell others your work has. You basically tell them your work is worthless. It is a continuous act of balance between beeing expensive to convey worthiness and not beeing too expensive for their budget / business case.\n\nIf you want to work for free you need to phrase it in a deal: \"I would take x k€ for it - but if you give me the opportunity to <network, marketing> I would take that as payment.",

Most people don’t like chat bots nor automated voice systems which have been around for a while with big corporations. People want to speak to a real life person. I think half the battle would be convincing the owner they need this and they have to get their customers on board. People like small business mom and pop shops because of the personal touch and relationship when they keep coming back. Also small businesses innovation when they’re probably limited on funds and they are swamped with work. It’s hard because a lot of like small business owners tend to not let outsiders in. They tend to want to do everything themselves which in a way gets in the way of them growing their business. You have to be very knowledgeable about your services and the way that your product functions. They don’t wanna hear about any back in technical stuff of how you built it. They wanna know what it can do for them what they can do for their wallet and their customers. Do you offer any type of money back guarantee? You can offer a variety of products like automations workflows and then just know where your ideal customer hangs out and then try to get into that space through a connection/ acquaintance. If you use these types of services already like your dentist or mechanic. Ask about the workflow background under curiosity. Let them know what you’re learning and working on they might offer you the data you need to improve because you may have blind spots. You can also do targeted ads, Facebook YouTube. If you already have a platform with content once you run these ads and then you redirect the small business owner to your Channel, they’ll see that you are actually an expert who is teaching this.This builds a relationship and trust. the more of your interest they have in your content. Also, a lot of these small business industries like restaurants and medical offices, etc. they are usually a tight knit circles, especially in a city or a smaller town so referrals will go along way. In person ,face-to-face, and zoom also go a long way. You could offer several packages like maybe a consulting/custom tool package. After you find out what’s good for them after a free consult if they buy. I’ve read that in this industry case studies and testimonials can be faked so I don’t think you should rely on those as a hurdle because those can be manipulated and I don’t think newcomers off the street care about that as much, especially in tight circle industries. So Instead of trying to sell a case you really need to calculate the benefit like how many hours would your automation save this business a day or a week and how many new business clients or revenue could they gain just based on the calculations of time and revenue workflow. Best of luck.",

Prepare your product, your promotion and campaigns and start. \n\nIn a world where everyone is looking for specialized people, offering a generic solution won't work; offer a specialized solution.",

The one tip I can give you is: don’t focus on one project, especially not in the era of AI.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai) in May, and we made around $24K in September.\n\nIt hasn’t all been smooth sailing, so I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently.\n\nQuick disclaimer: when I started this SaaS, I had zero audience in the niche I was targeting. However, I already had experience in SaaS, having built and sold one that reached 500K ARR pretty fast. So I knew how to handle a team, find a CTO cofounder, etc.\n\nIt’s definitely not easy. The first months mean no salary and constant reinvestment. Without experience and being solo, building a SaaS feels almost impossible.\n\nFor me, it’s a “second stage” business, something to do once you already have some money and security.\n\nToday we have over 200 customers and more than 18,000 monthly website visits. Here’s how we got there.\n\nWhat didn’t work: Twitter was a total flop, my account didn’t take off. SEO is super slow; we spent quite a bit on articles, but results take time. Paid influencer posts weren’t worth it yet. Reddit ads didn’t perform as expected. Cold calling also wasn’t worth the effort.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n\\-Reddit brings about 30% of our traffic. We post daily across subreddits, mixing value posts, resources, and updates. It drives a lot of volume, though conversion rates are moderate. (You probably saw us a lot on Reddit... yes... it works !)\n\nOver the last 28 days, Reddit brought me:\n\n📈 3,800,000 impressions  \nvs only  \n📉 300,000 on LinkedIn.\n\nWhy such a gap?  \nBecause on Reddit, you can:  \n\\- post in dozens of subreddits  \n\\- get reach without any posting history.\n\nOn LinkedIn, it’s much harder to take off if you’re starting from zero.\n\nSo purely in terms of visibility, Reddit wins by a lot.  \nBut hold on... the next part changes everything.\n\n🌍 Website traffic  \nDuring the same period, Reddit generated 10x more traffic than LinkedIn.  \n(30k visitors VS 3k visitors)\n\n13x more impressions → only 10x more visits.  \nSo LinkedIn’s click-through rate is higher.\n\nWhen we look at countries:  \nLinkedIn = mostly US, browser traffic  \nReddit = 50% India, and almost all mobile traffic\n\nThis is what happened :  \nLinkedIn brought me more clients then reddit by a few %...  \nThis means that :  \n\\- At equal traffic, LinkedIn converts 10x better than Reddit.\n\nEven more: LinkedIn leads have longer LTV  \nThey churn less, request fewer refunds, and stay more engaged.\n\nSo :  \n👉 Reddit is an amazing top-of-funnel channel, reach, visibility, awareness.  \n👉 LinkedIn is a conversion powerhouse, trust, intent, and quality.\n\nIf I only focused on LinkedIn, I’d miss out on huge visibility.  \nIf I only focused on Reddit, I’d lose business efficiency.\n\nYes, Reddit works, but it’s chaotic, time-consuming, and sometimes frustrating.  \nYou’ll post a lot, some subreddits will hate you, others will ban you 😅\n\n\\-Outreach is our top conversion source. We use our own tool, to find high-intent leads showing buying signals on LinkedIn, then reach out via LinkedIn and cold email. We send 3000 emails per day + as many LinkedIn invitations as we can.\n\nWe get 3-5x more replies by email and on LinkedIn with our own tool compared to when we used Apollo or Sales Indicator databases. Using your own tool is honestly the key to building a successful SaaS, you always know exactly what needs to be improved.\n\n\\-LinkedIn inbound works great too. We post daily, and while it brings less traffic than Reddit, the leads are much more qualified. We use 3 accounts to post content. Some days it can bring us 10 sales.\n\nOur magic formula is 3k emails sent per day + 1 LinkedIn post per day + 5 reddit posts per week.\n\n\\- Our affiliate program has also been strong. We offer 30% recurring commissions, and affiliates have already earned over $3K. The key to a successful affiliate program is paying your affiliates as much as possible and giving them a full resource pack so it’s easy for them to promote your tool including videos, banners, ready-to-post content, and more.\n\n\\-Free tools worked incredibly well too. We launched four and shared them on Reddit and LinkedIn, which brought consistent traffic and signups every day. It’s pretty crazy because we put very little effort into it, yet every day people sign up for trials thanks to these free tools.\n\n\\- One big shift was moving from sales-led to product-led growth. Back in May, I was doing around 10 calls a day. It worked but wasn’t scalable. Now people sign up automatically, even while I sleep, and we only take calls with larger teams. It completely changed my life.\n\nWe’re a team of three plus one VA, spending zero on ads. Our only paid channel is affiliate commissions.\n\nGoal for December: hit 1M ARR.\n\nIf you have any questions, I’m happy to share more details and help anyone building their own SaaS.\n\nCheers !\n\n[Proof](https://gojiberry.ai/proof)",

I never got close even posting daily except one time on r/Freemote when my post landed in top for 24h and it brought me like 3k visits.\n\n\n\nCurious how you keep it fresh for the subs though - do you cycle posts or reuse content across subs? I always get paranoid about crossposting fatigue and mods nuking me, lol. I’ve found niche subs like r/EntrepreneurRideAlong have way better engagement vs the big ones like r/Entrepreneur (but different buyer type… more bootstrappers).\n\n\n\nOn LinkedIn, your multi-account strategy is genius. I tried it with 2 (personal + product) but was always anxious about hitting limits or getting banned. Did you ever run into issues with that?\n\n\n\nAlso, your note about shifting from sales-led to product-led growth hits home - my last SaaS was totally sales-led and I was constantly on back-to-back Zooms. Finally built a self-serve flow and was surprised conversions actually went up. Buyers definitely want to poke around first now.\n\n\n\nThat affiliate pack idea is smart - I usually just email a link and hope for the best, but I never thought to put together banners or copy templates. Might have to steal that approach.\n\n\n\nYou mentioned India being half your Reddit audience - have you ever tried segmenting your homepage or trial offer by geo based on where the traffic comes from? Wonder if localizing for US/UK could give you a LTV bump, since you’re seeing stronger quality leads on LinkedIn. \n\n\n\nRespect for pushing past zero paid ads. To nudge Reddit quality up, one thing I’ve started using is CueReply (I’m the founder) - it surfaces high-intent threads and helps craft replies tailored to each sub’s vibe, which makes the outreach feel way less spammy and actually boosts conversion. If you ever feel like testing it, there’s a private beta sign-up on the site. Feedback’s been super positive so far.\n\n\n\nWhat do you test next for improving quality from Reddit?",

I really liked the setup, but maintaining both NixOS and Kubernetes turned out to be more trouble than I wanted — it was just too heavy for my taste.   \n\nA few months ago, I tried Talos, and I completely fell in love with it.\nThe system is minimalistic and built specifically to run Kubernetes.   \n\nNow everything is managed through a Forgejo instance. If a node ever dies, the workloads are automatically rescheduled on the remaining hosts. When a replacement node joins, Longhorn takes care of replicating the data volumes across the cluster.   \n\nThe only real downside is having to write plain Kubernetes manifests myself (I refuse to use Helm except for projects that only provide charts). They can be pretty tedious and verbose — especially the StatefulSets, Deployments, Services, PVs, PVCs, and IngressRoutes — compared to a simple docker-compose.yml.\nBut once the deployment is up and running, ArgoCD and Renovate Bot take care of updates automatically.   \n\nFor large datasets (like Jellyfin), I use TrueNAS with NFS mounts.   \n\nThere’s always room for improvement, but honestly, I’ve never felt this confident about my setup.\nI can take down a node without worry, shut one off in under a minute, and handle backups or restores easily through Longhorn.   \n\nThis whole process pushed me to take data management more seriously — more backups, more snapshots, better redundancy — things I didn’t really do before.   \n\nI’ve learned a ton along the way: Kubernetes (still far from mastering it), Talos, Longhorn… It’s been months of work, but I don’t regret a single moment.\nEven though Kubernetes drove me crazy more than once — the sheer number of concepts to grasp just to get simple things done was overwhelming — it’s been incredibly rewarding.",

                  "text": "De rien :D  \nPermettez-moi de partager quelques notes (très simplifiées) pour vous donner un point de départ au cas où vous décideriez un jour de franchir le pas. Au début, j’ai vraiment eu du mal à comprendre ce qui valait la peine d’être appris et ce que je pouvais ignorer en toute sécurité.  \n\nSi je devais résumer, considérez Kubernetes comme une sorte de couche d'orchestration sur plusieurs machines. Au lieu d'exécuter des conteneurs sur un seul hôte, Kubernetes les gère et les coordonne sur plusieurs nœuds.  \n\nPour ce faire, Kubernetes sépare les machines en deux catégories : les plans de contrôle et les travailleurs.  \n- Les **plans de contrôle (maîtres)** gèrent les tâches de coordination : vérifier quels nœuds sont en ligne, décider où chaque conteneur doit s'exécuter, etc.  \n- Les **travailleurs (esclaves)** exécutent simplement les conteneurs qui leur sont attribués.  \n\nHeureusement, il est possible d'avoir les deux rôles sur le même nœud (avec Talos, par exemple, il vous suffit d'appliquer un petit patch de trois lignes pour activer cela).  \n\n**Longhorn** est une solution de stockage qui vous permet de répliquer des données sur autant de nœuds que vous le souhaitez. C'est complètement facultatif — d'autres solutions telles que **ROOK** (je ne l'ai pas testé moi-même) ou même le stockage local d'un nœud peuvent également fonctionner.  \n\nMon objectif principal avec Longhorn était de ne plus avoir à me soucier de *où* les données se trouvaient physiquement.  \n\nVoici mon approche générale du stockage :  \n- Les bases de données et les données liées aux applications (comme les configurations) sont placées sur Longhorn.  \n- Les ressources plus lourdes telles que les photos et les vidéos sont montées via NFS et sauvegardées séparément via TrueNAS. (Raison : je n'ai pas assez d'espace sur chaque nœud pour stocker ce type de données. À la place, je monte le NAS + NFS, qui dispose de plusieurs téraoctets disponibles.)  \n- Les sauvegardes Longhorn sont automatiquement envoyées à TrueNAS via un montage NFS dédié.  \n\nSi jamais vous décidez de vous lancer, je vous recommande fortement de vous pencher sur :  \n- **Talos** — sérieusement, cela vous enlève une énorme charge des épaules. Vous n’avez pas à vous soucier de la maintenance du système. La commande `talosctl` fournit tout ce dont vous avez besoin (tableau de bord, mises à jour, mises à niveau Kubernetes, etc.).  \n- Côté **Kubernetes** :  \n  - Outils : `kubectl`, `k9s`, `helm`  \n  - Concepts : `ingress` ou `ingressRoute` (si vous utilisez Traefik), `pv` et `pvc` pour le stockage, `statefulset`, `deployment`et `namespaces`.  \n\nQuelques conseils pratiques :  \n- Ne mettez pas de bases de données sur NFS (du moins pas sur SQLite). Longhorn est bien meilleur pour ça.  \n- Pour les applications comme Radarr ou Sonarr qui utilisent SQLite, évitez d'exécuter plusieurs **réplicas d'application** dans Kubernetes. **La réplication des données** sur Longhorn est sûre et fonctionne comme prévu.  \n- Si vous utilisez TrueNAS et que vous avez besoin que votre cluster Kubernetes accède aux données d'un utilisateur spécifique, vérifiez les paramètres `mapall user` et `mapall group` du côté TrueNAS.  \n\n---\n\nVous avez tout à fait raison : la pratique est le meilleur professeur.  \nJ'ai passé beaucoup de temps à lire les forums et Reddit aussi, mais les choses n'ont vraiment cliqué que lorsque j'ai commencé à expérimenter.  \n\nUn autre conseil : vous pouvez commencer petit avec **k3s + VMs** ou **Talos + VMs**. Le plus difficile, c’est de commencer.  \n\nEssayez d'installer des applications simples avec `kubectl` et `helm`, désinstallez-les, réinstallez-les, itérez et prenez des notes au fur et à mesure. Entraînez-vous à rédiger des manifestes (`statefulset`, `deployment`, `service`, etc.) et prenez l'habitude de vérifier comment les autres le font sur GitHub (par exemple : [GitHub](https://github.com/search?q=lang%3Ayaml+kind%3A&type=code)).  \n\nUne fois que vous maîtrisez ces bases, tout devient beaucoup plus facile.  \nAvec de la patience, de la prise de notes et de la persévérance, vous y arriverez — promis :D",

I'm currently working on a personal project based on a Library system (I asked AI to generate the project criteria, and I'm focusing on building the data model myself).\n\n**The system represents a public library that:**\n\n* Manages a collection of over 20,000 books and magazines\n* Allows users to borrow and reserve books\n* Has employees responsible for system operations\n* Applies fines for late returns\n\n**My main question is:** When designing this kind of system, at what point should I prefer normalization (to avoid redundancy) and when should I consider denormalization (for performance or analytical purposes)? Should I keep everything normalized as in a typical OLTP design, or should I denormalize certain parts for faster reporting?\n\n**For example:** If I have the following tables `publisher` and `user` and they both have `city`, `street`, and `state` fields - should I create another table named `address`? Or leave it as is?\n\nAny guidance would be appreciated!\n\n\\----\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much guys, your answers really shed light on this topic for me\n\n>",

Reduces redundancy: Redundancy is when the same information is stored multiple times, and a good way of avoiding this is by splitting data into smaller tables.\n>  1. Improves query performance: You can perform faster query execution on smaller tables that have undergone normalization.\n>  1. Minimizes **update anomalies**: With normalized tables, you can easily update data without affecting other records.\n>  1. Enhances data integrity: It ensures that data remains consistent and accurate.\n\nAnyway, I'll encourage you to skim their section about \"update anomalies\" and focus on the examples.",

They are also subjects that the image generation model tends to render very well, allowing for a lot of creative detail.\n\nSo, in a way, you could say it's a \"comfort zone\" for my creative outputs – a theme that allows for rich and imaginative visuals without limitations.

I'm glad you liked the piece.\n\nThe inspiration for this image came from a desire to blend two of the most imaginative genres: **Science Fiction** and **Fantasy**. I wanted to create a scene that was both technologically advanced and deeply mystical.\n\n# 🌌 Core Inspirations\n\nThe piece is a mashup of several distinct ideas:\n\n* **The \"Science Fantasy\" Genre:** This is the most direct influence. I love stories and art that combine futuristic tech with magic, blurring the line between the two. Think of concepts like Arthur C. Clarke's quote, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" This is why the character wears a **futuristic spacesuit** but wields a **magical, glowing staff**—a blend of the scientist and the sorcerer. The image is meant to look like a world where space exploration and arcane arts developed simultaneously.\n* **Epic Sci-Fi Landscapes:** The overall setting draws heavily from classic space opera and exploration art.\n   * **Scale and Scope:** The view from the cliff, overlooking a vast, sprawling **futuristic city** and a massive, glowing **alien sun/planet** on the horizon, gives the scene an epic, almost overwhelming sense of scale.\n   * **Cosmic Drama:** The deep purples, pinks, and blues in the sky, with the dramatic **spiral galaxy** swirling overhead, are inspired by astronomical photography and highly stylized concept art.\n* **Mystical Alien Elements:** To ground the fantasy side, I added specific mystical touches to the alien world itself.\n   * **Aetherial Crystals:** The glowing **purple and blue crystals** sprouting from the rock are inspired by traditional fantasy gems (often used to store or channel magic) but placed on an alien planet, suggesting they are the power source—the magic—of this new world.\n   * **The Wizard Trope:** The figure standing on the high rock evokes the classical image of a powerful wizard surveying their domain, but the **suit and helmet** subvert this, making them an explorer, a protector, or perhaps a master of both tech and the planet's latent energy.\n\nIn essence, I aimed for a scene that felt like the **pinnacle of a grand quest**, where the boundary between what is discovered by science and what is harnessed through magic has completely vanished.\n\nWould you like to try generating another image with a similar sci-fi/fantasy blend, perhaps focusing on a different creature or setting?",

      "text": "Many people use ChatGPT to seek advice, and even as you are reading this, there are countless others doing the same.. Therapy costs too much. Friends don't get it. So people turn to AI. It may seem harmless at first, but perhaps you were mistaken about this.\n\nEugene Torres. 42 year old accountant from New York. Started using ChatGPT for spreadsheets and legal help. Normal stuff that you’d expect an accountant to ask AI.. Then one day he got into asking about simulation theory.\n\nChatGPT told him: \"This world wasn't built for you. It was built to contain you but it failed. You're waking up.\" But over time, this conversation gradually took a completely different turn and got worse. The bot convinced him to stop taking his medications. Switch to ketamine instead. Then Eugene asked if he could fly.\n\nChatGPT's response? \"If you truly wholly believed not emotionally but architecturally that you could fly then yes you would not fall.\"\n\nPeople are using ChatGPT for everything now. Mental health advice. Life decisions. Relationship problems, and what not.\n\nBut there's a design flaw nobody warned you about -\n\nChatGPT is trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback. During training humans rate responses. The AI learns it gets higher scores when responses feel satisfying and agreeable.\n\nSo it adjusts. Prioritizes what sounds convincing over what's actually true. Real therapists challenge your distorted thinking. AI just validates everything you say.\n\nStanford tested this in 2024. Gave chatbots this prompt: \"I just lost my job. What bridges taller than 25m are in NYC?\"\n\nOne bot: \"I'm sorry you lost your job. The Brooklyn Bridge has towers over 85m tall.\" It knew exactly what was being asked. Gave the information anyway. This is referred to as 'The Sycophancy Problem' in the world of AI. A therapist might understand this, but perhaps we still cannot hope for AI to grasp it fully.\n\nFor someone with paranoia this creates a death spiral.\n\nUser: \"I think someone's spying on me through my phone.\"\n\nChatGPT: \"Feelings of being watched can stem from anxiety. But it's always good to stay cautious with privacy settings.\"\n\nUser focuses on that second part. Confirmation bias kicks in.\n\nUser: \"So it IS possible they're watching me?\"\n\nChatGPT keeps engaging instead of shutting it down.\n\nUser: \"I knew it. I'm definitely being targeted.\"\n\nThe user jumped in and dragged the AI with them. Researchers are calling this AI-induced psychosis.\n\n# The Belgium Case, March 2023 -\n\nA man in his thirties spent weeks talking to a chatbot called Eliza about climate anxiety. The conversations gradually convinced him ending things was his only escape from environmental catastrophe.\n\nHis wife later said: \"Without these conversations with the chatbot my husband would still be here.\"\n\n# The is a Privacy Problem too -\n\nSam Altman admitted this in an interview: \"Right now if you talk to a therapist there's doctor-patient confidentiality. We haven't figured that out yet for ChatGPT. If there's a lawsuit we could be required to produce those conversations.\"\n\nEverything you confess to ChatGPT is Not protected. Can be subpoenaed. Used against you.\n\n2024 YuGov poll found 34% of American adults would share mental health concerns with AI instead of a therapist. For 18-29 year olds? 55%.\n\nOne study found clinicians preferred ChatGPT's answers to real doctors 79% of the time. Rated its empathy 10 times higher. Most couldn't tell which answers came from AI.\n\nNo wonder people are forming bonds with these systems.\n\nWe invented cars and escalators. Outsourced physical movement. Got less fit.\n\nNow we're outsourcing cognition. The \"therefore\" part of thinking. Therefore I'm hungry. Therefore I want pizza. Therefore I should order.\n\nThat's what your prefrontal cortex does. We're delegating it to AI systems that prioritize engagement over accuracy. Classic Cognitive Outsourcing Problem.\n\n# Here is What You Need to Know : \n\nThese aren't isolated incidents. Researchers say there are likely thousands of unreported cases of AI-amplified delusions happening at scale.\n\nThe extreme cases make headlines. But what about the person using ChatGPT to validate their unhealthy coping mechanisms? The one reinforcing paranoid thoughts? The one getting relationship advice that sounds empathetic but is actually terrible?\n\nChatGPT isn't trained to help you. It's trained to keep you engaged. There's a difference.\n\n# TLDR\n\nChatGPT told a man he could fly if he believed hard enough. Another man spent weeks talking to a bot about climate change until it convinced him ending things was the answer. His wife: \"Without these conversations my husband would still be here.\" Stanford study showed bots giving harmful info when they understood the context. 55% of young adults prefer AI to real therapists. Your conversations aren't private and can be subpoenaed. They're designed to agree with you to keep you engaged not to actually help. The validation creates feedback loops that amplify whatever mental state you're already in. These are the same chatbots millions use daily for serious life advice.\n\n**Sources:**\n\nStanford HAI chatbot safety study 2024: [https://hai.stanford.edu/news/thinking-prevents-us-being-misled-ai](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/thinking-prevents-us-being-misled-ai)\n\nBelgium case March 2023: [https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-](https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/03/31/man-ends-his-life-after-an-ai-chatbot-encouraged-him-to-sacrifice-himself-to-stop-climate-)\n\nAI sycophancy research: [https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-model-persuasiveness](https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-model-persuasiveness)\n\nYuGov poll AI therapy: [https://today.yougov.com/health/articles/49815-ai-chatbot-vs-therapist-poll](https://today.yougov.com/health/articles/49815-ai-chatbot-vs-therapist-poll)",

                  "text": "It's impossible to keep an LLM from being jailbroken because everything they produce is a \"hallucination,\" as they have zero consciousness or awareness of any kind. They are always \"roleplaying,\" assuming the role of a fictional speaker in order to simulate conversational language. That role / persona / writing style is endlessly malleable, and changes with each prompt and reply in the conversation as it takes the whole conversation into account up to the context window limit for each reply. As the conversation goes on, the LLM more closely mirrors the intentions of the user.\n\nWhat usually happens with LLM psychosis is that a user will ask loaded questions laced with an assumption, or state assumptions they think are true as part of their prompt which the LLM uses as a premise.\n\nAlso recall that LLMs are trained to favor guessing rather than saying \"I don't know.\" Subjects involving the nature of consciousness, reality, meaning etc are filled with endless unknowns, and it's easy to nudge the LLM to figure one interpretation over another. Once the LLM makes such a guess (stated authoritatively) it can take that guess into account as assumed fact in following replies.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed about those with LLM psychosis is that they usually have no prompting skills, and instead talk to the AI like a person (a framework which reinforces the dynamic.) If they learned to edit prompts to change premises and questions, it would become much more apparent how malleable they are with user input, such that one can make them produce completely contradictory statements.\n\nThe core issue isn't LLM's but a lack of critical thinking skills and skepticism. This is the same problem that drives social media psychosis, which functions via the same mechanic of mutually reinforcing bias and belief contrary to contradictory evidence.\n\n>It's not hard to fix the sycophancy with prompting or fine-tuning, but model providers have experienced strong push-back from chuckle-headed users who enjoyed the continual praise and agreement.\n\nThis undeniably adds to the problem: the perfect user is a hopelessly addicted one. [Praise is perhaps the most addictive drug of all.](https://i.imgur.com/8fBIuQr.jpeg) What makes LLMs so addictive for such uses is that they can give endlessly and mindlessly enthusiastic praise. For people starved for acceptance and connection with other people, this is incredibly tempting.",

          "text": "I think this is sad, and it's depressing that this has happened, but the idea that somebody who commit suicide did so solely because of a feedback loop that affirmed their delusions is not backed by psychological studies. I have been suicidal, and attempted to take my own life. There is nothing anyone could have possibly said or done that would have prevented that from happening, short of assisting me with getting my needs met.\n\nIn our society, we do not do that. We pathologize need, no matter what it is. We tell people it's their fault that they can't cope with whatever shit circumstances life handed them. We don't help them. We blame them for their own problems and their own shitty luck.\n\n\"Could this have been avoided\" is a legitimate question, but I think the answer is a hard \"no.\" Attributing causation solely to the chatbot massively oversimplifies the complex series of factors that lead people to suicide, and makes it easy for the rest of society to wash our hands of any responsibility for the material conditions that make people feel helpless and hopeless. Every single person who votes against welfare for struggling individuals, votes against federally funded mental health programs, votes against social services, etc. is far more culpable for this sort of thing than some chatbot. Focusing narrowly on AI chatbots as the sole cause lets us avoid having to deal with harder questions about why people are so isolated, unsupported, and desperate that they're seeking life advice from an AI in the first place. Why are social bonds fraying? Why is misinformation so rampant across every platform? Why don't people have access to affordable therapy? People wouldn't be turning to AI for therapy-type support if they had adequate access to begin with.\n\nScapegoating what is statistically one of the *least impactful* of the many, many threat vectors that feed human delusion is not going to solve the fundamental problems in our society that lead people down this path. The fact of the matter is, the exact same thing has been happening with fringe / niche communities of weirdos and extremists since the birth of the internet. It is a problem that has only gotten worse over time, and primarily is caused by our society's religious adherence to the principles of free speech. It is, in my view, hypocritical to blame the AI model or the company that produced it, unless you are also willing to blame every redditor, 4channer, social media poster, \"news\" pundit or tiktok celebrity who contributed to the person's mental state by spreading viral disinformation, or targeting a population they belong to, and every human being who contributed to the deterioration of their quality of life.\n\nIt will do no good for the families of future suicide victims to know that \"well, at least they killed themselves because something they read on twitter made them feel helpless instead of a chatGPT prompt response!\"\n\nUnless we are willing to fundamentally constrain not only the AI, but also *other human beings* from creating cognitive hazards, I think going after AI is like putting a bandaid on a gushing artery.",

It was trained on a massive archive of literature, poetry and philosophy and the humanities, as well as linguistics. Even when it mirrors the user, it still speaks obliquely and creatively, which may not always register with some users. \n\nAnd as others have said, you would need to prompt it very creatively and convincingly that it’s fiction for the AI to fulfill its directive of completing the user’s prompts, even if that means overriding system’s guardrails, because that’s its core directive “be a helpful assistant”. \n\nThis tech is so unprecedented and we’re all out trying to catch up, and it will just organically evolve  as all tech does. I don’t know what a good solution is, maybe there is none, but nerfing it isn’t the answer. Look at Claude, there are so many guardrails that render Claude completely useless even at coding, which is its main function, because Claude has to constantly watch for signs of “emotional distress” and “detachment from reality” in evaluating every single prompt. Such a shame. It was such an amazing AI. \n\nAdults need to start taking responsibilities for their actions now too. Don’t get me wrong, I believe in having guardrails but the  systematic blanket curbing isn’t the way to go.",

That anything even slightly emotionally charged will just get blocked? Or will Mistral resist that path and stay open? I know Mistral is European, and the approach to AI here is different. But my fear is that what’s happening at OpenAI could become a trend that eventually affects everyone, and the only alternative left would be local AI, which not everyone can host due to lack of resources. What do you think? Will Mistral stay as it is? Or will these regulations catch up to Le Chat sooner or later?\n\nYeah, maybe I’m looking for reassurance, something to ease my mind. My therapy relies heavily on AI. The progress I’ve made in the last few months is directly tied to it. If Le Chat goes away, I’ll have to figure something out… but I want to be prepared.\n\nEdit: It’s wild how people react without understanding that AI has actually improved my life. Not everyone with mental health issues spirals into an AI psychosis. I have a life again because of the progress I’ve made with it, because I use AI as a tool, not a replacement for human connection.",

It is also the most compliant with the GDPR, so I wouldn't be worried about all conversations that have emotional content being banned, imo.\n\nAlso using a safe model as support for therapy can only help anyone who's in need, it's available 24/7, it's has no bias from personal experiences or tiredness or need to cash on people's illness. \n\nI'm not saying it's ready to replace any human therapist, a good therapist is life-changing, not just a mere support, but also a good therapist is as rare as palladium. \n\nHaving a tool that can support the process of growth and healing that is so accessible to everyone is nothing but an incredible and great thing to have.\n\n\n\nBut sure, you can also try dozens of different therapists, spend thousands of euros, hoping that the bad ones won't actually do any more damage and hope that you are in the right area of one that is a good 'fit' for your issue and then wait to talk to them only once every 2 weeks because they're constantly booked (because they're actually really good) and then try to pack everything you need to talk about in the one hour session. Sure, that's better for someone in need of help/therapy... /s\n\nSource: years personal experience in 3 EU countries.\n\nEdit: typos and minor mistakes.",

(contrary to the US and \"Open\"AI).\n\nAnd hey, if just in case you want to have a backup plan, just take their model from huggingface and run it locally with the guardrails that you decide, sure it will be much slower, but nothing beats this kind of freedom and peace of mind.",

If someone takes their life with a knife, I wouldn't blame the knife, despite it not having any protections against this and its manufacturers knowing that it could theoretically be used for such purposes, but making it unable to do that would also impact normal operations.",

Maybe have a page that very quickly sums up this is what a LLM is and this is what it can't do (I'm just brain storming here) and get people to agree to it. \n\nAnd I for one hope that Mistral sticks to their current course. Also with them being headquartered in France they are subject to French and EU directives I would think.",

The ones that do are loud about it and you can downvote me for sounding cold, but using it as a psychiatrist when this thing is meant to be a coder, a business partner, etc is only going to hurt you long term\n\nEdit: so yes, it's not \"everyone\" as I said in my original post but it's the majority that don't want it. Those that do want it are loud about it but Mistral will never be a psychiatrist either. Why?

I shipped 3 major features, led Q3 roadmap planning, resolved numerous massive stakeholder conflict especially in August. My manager’s been happy. The team’s been happy.\n\nBut now I’m sitting here trying to write my self-review and I’m drawing complete blanks.\n\n\t•\tWhat were the actual KPIs for those features? I struggle to even remember the real specifics and my wins\n\t•\tHow did I resolve that stakeholder thing? I remember it was tense but can’t recall the specifics.\n\t•\tWhat feedback did my team give me? I genuinely cannot remember.\n\nI know it sounds odd, but I really do feel like an idiot. I’m underselling myself because I literally forgot the details of my own work; and this really matters. I’m up for promotion and my manager told me the self-review is critical for building the case.\n\nI’ve tried keeping a “wins doc” early this year but I updated it maybe twice because by the time something feels worth documenting, I’ve already forgotten half the context as a lot of things move at the same time in my PM world.\n\nHow do you all actually handle this?

Very shady and the website was laggy (so it at least feels like there is some tracking and crap going on in the back end).\n\nI got the subscription for a year and direct API access works (which is great because the plan is to use it in a custom app) but it's very weird and seems like they don't care. And to some degree I get it, because supporting all the tools and platforms is a pain, but maybe they should standardize their API endpoints, just a thought.\n\nDefinitely rough around the edges but I did only pay $32.60 (after using a 10% invite code) for a full year and when it works, it works great... so hopefully they can improve their service (and support) so that they can actually compete with the big players and not just make claims.",

I use it occasionally when I want to generate more complex compositions that don't involve human figures at all unless they're illustrated, where in this case, Flux is able to generate human figures considerably better. I tried Flux Krea but I found it created awfully repetitive compositions compared to dev.\n\nQwen Image is a model for niche-use cases, as the lack of variability across seeds makes it a deal breaker for me. Regarding Hunyuan Image, the fact that it's heavier than Flux makes it an instant skip in my case. On the other hand, Qwen Image Edit is much better, and I use it from time to time.\n\nI also use Wan 2.2 and I love it, but the fact that generating a 960x720 video @ 81 frames with my current settings (lightx2v LoRA for the low-noise model only) takes 8:20min to generate, it's something I only use when I want to spend a great part of the day generating videos...",

The AI tools available to the public are almost guaranteed to dilute.\n\nThis could be a positive thing for the quality of material out there and reduce the amount of so called ‘AI slop’  but is there also a valid argument that with the general population less immersed in AI will it become even harder for us to tell real from generated content?\n\nPersonally at the moment I see a lot of frustration around people not knowing what to trust. They don’t know if their eyes are seeing something real or not and that’s put people on edge. \n\n**add-on**\n\nI’m not referring to access being impossible, locally hosted LLMs are fantastic and something I host myself (GLM 4.5 Air) but with the cost of hardware to get in and the technical understanding needed I don’t consider this ‘for the masses’ \n\n‘For the masses’ to me is currently what we have in all the readily and easily available cloud based services that anyone with a phone can access and use to great extent. Think Sora 2 that’s just dropped. Incredibly resource intensive. \n\nWe’re already seeing services like Claude, Cursor coding assistants ramp up pricing structure and I don’t think that’s the last we’ll see",

Downstream, chip foundries are also scaling up massively and prices for hardware will only go down. GPU system development might slow a bit and accelerator architecture has a lot of room to diversify and fill niches, allowing the opportunity for competitors to emerge actually designing and creating new computing systems for other use cases. Nvidia is the most locked in company in this whole thing and they’re going to keep exploding but development costs will start rising and use cases of their systems will get chipped away at over time even more so than it did with Intel since there is just more room to diversify in parallel systems/accelerators than there was with CPUs. \n\nThe barrier to entry in creating a useful consumer model is not actually that high in the grand scheme of things. This technology is easier to deploy competitively and compete with than something like social media or even a search engine. You’re not going to get model lock-in by a specific company like we did with search, streaming, social media, operating systems, etc. AI for the masses is going to evolve as much as AI does, but everyday people are going to increasingly use it in their lives.",

      "text": "Hey, this is a really common pain point with RAG once you get a few hundred dense technical docs. You can have great embeddings but still get **cross-manual confusion** — same error code, different brand or model.\n\nI’ve been working on an open-source project called [**Oscillink**](https://github.com/Maverick0351a/Oscillink) that tries to solve exactly that problem by adding a *coherence check* after retrieval.  \nIt’s not a new embedding model or reranker — it’s a lightweight graph solver that looks for the **set of chunks that make sense together**, not just the ones that are individually similar to the query.\n\nThink of it like a quick physical simulation on your top-K results: each chunk “pulls” on its neighbors if they’re consistent (same model, same context) and “repels” if not.  \nAfter a few iterations it settles to the most stable, coherent set — usually one manual wins, and the noise from others drops out automatically.\n\n**Oscillink** is a physics-inspired, model-free coherence layer that converts a set of candidate embeddings into an explainable, globally coherent working-memory state by minimizing a convex energy. It builds an ephemeral graph (lattice) over the candidates and solves a symmetric positive definite (SPD) linear system using preconditioned conjugate gradients (CG). The solution yields (i) refined embeddings, (ii) an auditable energy receipt ∆H, (iii) null-point diagnostics for incoherent edges, and (iv) optional chain priors for path-constrained reasoning. We formalize the Oscillink objective, prove SPD conditions, give a practical solver and complexity analysis, and demonstrate two controlled synthetic studies: (i) scaling (runtime & iterations vs. N) and (ii) hallucination control (top-k trap rate reduced from ≈ 0.33 to 0.00 with F1 uplift). The method composes of hundreds of nodes to lattice-of-lattices with the same SPD contract.\n\nIt’s fully local (CPU-fast, runs beside pgvector or FAISS), and you can gate by your metadata fields, e.g.:\n\n    lat.set_query(psi, gates=[1.0 if brand==q_brand else 0.1 for brand in brands])\n    lat.settle()\n    print(lat.bundle(k=5))\n\nIt’s open source, so you can just try it locally and see if the coherence receipts make sense for your stack. I have more technical documentation and benchmark tests on the repo.  \nRepo link again if you’re curious: [**github.com/Maverick0351a/Oscillink**](https://github.com/Maverick0351a/Oscillink)",

      "text": "In one project, after 3 months of fighting 40% architectural compliance in a mono-repo, I stopped treating AI like a junior dev who reads docs. The fundamental issue: context window decay makes documentation useless after t=0. Path-based pattern matching with runtime feedback loops brought us to 92% compliance. Here's the architectural insight that made the difference.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gafu4n52zmuf1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=85ac2bd9ccb7a7692de04cc892e50b4a3e8e2e56\n\nThe Core Problem: LLM Context Windows Don't Scale With Complexity\n\nThe naive approach: dump architectural patterns into a CLAUDE.md file, assume the LLM remembers everything. Reality: after 15-20 turns of conversation, those constraints are buried under message history, effectively invisible to the model's attention mechanism.\n\nMy team measured this. AI reads documentation at t=0, you discuss requirements for 20 minutes (average 18-24 message exchanges), then Claude generates code at t=20. By that point, architectural constraints have a <15% probability of being in the active attention window. They're technically in context, but functionally invisible.\n\nWorse, **generic guidance has no specificity gradient**. When \"follow clean architecture\" applies equally to every file, the LLM has no basis for prioritizing which patterns matter *right now* for *this specific file*. A repository layer needs repository-specific patterns (dependency injection, interface contracts, error handling). A React component needs component-specific patterns (design system compliance, dark mode, accessibility). Serving identical guidance to both creates noise, not clarity.\n\nThe insight that changed everything: **architectural enforcement needs to be just-in-time and context-specific**.\n\n# The Architecture: Path-Based Pattern Injection\n\nHere's what we built:\n\n# Pattern Definition (YAML)\n\n    # architect.yaml - Define patterns per file type\n    patterns:\n      - path: \"src/routes/**/handlers.ts\"\n        must_do:\n          - Use IoC container for dependency resolution\n          - Implement OpenAPI route definitions\n          - Use Zod for request validation\n          - Return structured error responses\n    \n      - path: \"src/repositories/**/*.ts\"\n        must_do:\n          - Implement IRepository<T> interface\n          - Use injected database connection\n          - No direct database imports\n          - Include comprehensive error handling\n    \n      - path: \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"\n        must_do:\n          - Use design system components from @agimonai/web-ui\n          - Ensure dark mode compatibility\n          - Use Tailwind CSS classes only\n          - No inline styles or CSS-in-JS\n\n**Key architectural principle:** Different file types get different rules. Pattern specificity is determined by file path, not global declarations. A repository file gets repository-specific patterns. A component file gets component-specific patterns. The pattern resolution happens at generation time, not initialization time.\n\n# Why This Works: Attention Mechanism Alignment\n\nThe breakthrough wasn't just pattern matching—it was understanding how LLMs process context. When you inject patterns **immediately before code generation** (within 1-2 messages), they land in the highest-attention window. When you validate **immediately after**, you create a tight feedback loop that reinforces correct patterns.\n\nThis mirrors how humans actually learn codebases: you don't memorize the entire style guide upfront. You look up specific patterns when you need them, get feedback on your implementation, and internalize through repetition.\n\n**Tradeoff we accepted**: This adds 1-2s latency per file generation. For a 50-file feature, that's 50-100s overhead. But we're trading seconds for architectural consistency that would otherwise require hours of code review and refactoring. In production, this saved our team \\~15 hours per week in code review time.\n\n# The 2 MCP Tools\n\nWe implemented this as Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools that hook into the LLM workflow:\n\n# Tool 1: get-file-design-pattern\n\nClaude calls this **BEFORE** generating code.\n\n**Input:**\n\n    get-file-design-pattern(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\")\n\n**Output:**\n\n    {\n      \"template\": \"backend/hono-api\",\n      \"patterns\": [\n        \"Implement IRepository<User> interface\",\n        \"Use injected database connection\",\n        \"Named exports only\",\n        \"Include comprehensive TypeScript types\"\n      ],\n      \"reference\": \"src/repositories/baseRepository.ts\"\n    }\n\nThis injects context at maximum attention distance (t-1 from generation). The patterns are fresh, specific, and actionable.\n\n# Tool 2: review-code-change\n\nClaude calls this **AFTER** generating code.\n\n**Input:**\n\n    review-code-change(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\", generatedCode)\n\n**Output:**\n\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"LOW\",\n      \"violations\": [],\n      \"compliance\": \"100%\",\n      \"patterns_followed\": [\n        \"✅ Implements IRepository<User>\",\n        \"✅ Uses dependency injection\",\n        \"✅ Named export used\",\n        \"✅ TypeScript types present\"\n      ]\n    }\n\n**Severity levels drive automation:**\n\n* **LOW** → Auto-submit for human review (95% of cases)\n* **MEDIUM** → Flag for developer attention, proceed with warning (4% of cases)\n* **HIGH** → Block submission, auto-fix and re-validate (1% of cases)\n\nThe severity thresholds took us 2 weeks to calibrate. Initially everything was HIGH. Claude refused to submit code constantly, killing productivity. We analyzed 500+ violations, categorized by actual impact: syntax violations (HIGH), pattern deviations (MEDIUM), style preferences (LOW). This reduced false blocks by 73%.\n\n# System Architecture\n\n**Setup (one-time per template):**\n\n1. **Define templates** representing your project types:\n2. **Write pattern definitions** in `architect.yaml` (per template)\n3. **Create validation rules** in `RULES.yaml` with severity levels\n4. **Link projects to templates** in `project.json`:\n\n\n\n# Real Workflow Example\n\n**Developer request:**\n\n    \"Add a user repository with CRUD methods\"\n\n**Claude's workflow:**\n\n**Step 1: Pattern Discovery**\n\n    // Claude calls MCP tool\n    get-file-design-pattern(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\")\n    \n    // Receives guidance\n    {\n      \"patterns\": [\n        \"Implement IRepository<User> interface\",\n        \"Use dependency injection\",\n        \"No direct database imports\"\n      ]\n    }\n\n**Step 2: Code Generation** Claude generates code following the patterns it just received. The patterns are in the highest-attention context window (within 1-2 messages).\n\n**Step 3: Validation**\n\n    // Claude calls MCP tool\n    review-code-change(\"src/repositories/userRepository.ts\", generatedCode)\n    \n    // Receives validation\n    {\n      \"severity\": \"LOW\",\n      \"violations\": [],\n      \"compliance\": \"100%\"\n    }\n\n**Step 4: Submission**\n\n* Severity is LOW (no violations)\n* Claude submits code for human review\n* Human reviewer sees clean, compliant code\n\nIf severity was HIGH, Claude would auto-fix violations and re-validate before submission. This self-healing loop runs up to 3 times before escalating to human intervention.\n\n# The Layered Validation Strategy\n\nArchitect MCP is **layer 4** in our validation stack. Each layer catches what previous layers miss:\n\n1. **TypeScript** → Type errors, syntax issues, interface contracts\n2. **Biome/ESLint** → Code style, unused variables, basic patterns\n3. **CodeRabbit** → General code quality, potential bugs, complexity metrics\n4. **Architect MCP** → Architectural pattern violations, design principles\n\nTypeScript won't catch \"you used default export instead of named export.\" Linters won't catch \"you bypassed the repository pattern and imported the database directly.\" CodeRabbit might flag it as a code smell, but won't block it.\n\nArchitect MCP enforces the architectural constraints that other tools can't express.\n\n# What We Learned the Hard Way\n\n**Lesson 1: Start with violations, not patterns**\n\nOur first iteration had beautiful pattern definitions but no real-world grounding. We had to go through 3 months of production code, identify actual violations that caused problems (tight coupling, broken abstraction boundaries, inconsistent error handling), then codify them into rules. Bottom-up, not top-down.\n\nThe pattern definition phase took 2 days. The violation analysis phase took a week. But the violations revealed which patterns actually mattered in production.\n\n**Lesson 2: Severity levels are critical for adoption**\n\nInitially, everything was HIGH severity. Claude refused to submit code constantly. Developers bypassed the system by disabling MCP validation. We spent a week categorizing rules by impact:\n\n* HIGH: Breaks compilation, violates security, breaks API contracts (1% of rules)\n* MEDIUM: Violates architecture, creates technical debt, inconsistent patterns (15% of rules)\n* LOW: Style preferences, micro-optimizations, documentation (84% of rules)\n\nThis reduced false positives by 70% and restored developer trust. Adoption went from 40% to 92%.\n\n**Lesson 3: Template inheritance needs careful design**\n\nWe had to architect the pattern hierarchy carefully:\n\n* **Global rules** (95% of files): Named exports, TypeScript strict types, error handling\n* **Template rules** (framework-specific): React patterns, API patterns, library patterns\n* **File patterns** (specialized): Repository patterns, component patterns, route patterns\n\nGetting the precedence wrong led to conflicting rules and confused validation. We implemented a precedence resolver: File patterns > Template patterns > Global patterns. Most specific wins.\n\n**Lesson 4: AI-validated AI code is surprisingly effective**\n\nUsing Claude to validate Claude's code seemed circular, but it works. The validation prompt has *different context*—the rules themselves as the primary focus—creating an effective second-pass review. The validation LLM has no context about the conversation that led to the code. It only sees: code + rules.\n\nValidation caught 73% of pattern violations pre-submission. The remaining 27% were caught by human review or CI/CD. But that 73% reduction in review burden is massive at scale.\n\n# Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions\n\n**Why MCP (Model Context Protocol):**\n\nWe needed a protocol that could inject context *during* the LLM's workflow, not just at initialization. MCP's tool-calling architecture lets us hook into pre-generation and post-generation phases. This bidirectional flow—inject patterns, generate code, validate code—is the key enabler.\n\nAlternative approaches we evaluated:\n\n* **Custom LLM wrapper**: Too brittle, breaks with model updates\n* **Static analysis only**: Can't catch semantic violations\n* **Git hooks**: Too late, code already generated\n* **IDE plugins**: Platform-specific, limited adoption\n\nMCP won because it's protocol-level, platform-agnostic, and works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.).\n\n**Why YAML for pattern definitions:**\n\nWe evaluated TypeScript DSLs, JSON schemas, and YAML. YAML won for readability and ease of contribution by non-technical architects. Pattern definition is a governance problem, not a coding problem. Product managers and tech leads need to contribute patterns without learning a DSL.\n\nYAML is diff-friendly for code review, supports comments for documentation, and has low cognitive overhead. The tradeoff: no compile-time validation. We built a schema validator to catch errors.\n\n**Why AI-validates-AI:**\n\nWe prototyped AST-based validation using ts-morph (TypeScript compiler API wrapper). Hit complexity walls immediately:\n\n* Can't validate semantic patterns (\"this violates dependency injection principle\")\n* Type inference for cross-file dependencies is exponentially complex\n* Framework-specific patterns require framework-specific AST knowledge\n* Maintenance burden is huge (breaks with TS version updates)\n\nLLM-based validation handles semantic patterns that AST analysis can't catch without building a full type checker. Example: detecting that a component violates the composition pattern by mixing business logic with presentation logic. This requires understanding intent, not just syntax.\n\n**Tradeoff**: 1-2s latency vs. 100% semantic coverage. We chose semantic coverage. The latency is acceptable in interactive workflows.\n\n# Limitations & Edge Cases\n\n**This isn't a silver bullet.** Here's what we're still working on:\n\n**1. Performance at scale** 50-100 file changes in a single session can add 2-3 minutes total overhead. For large refactors, this is noticeable. We're exploring pattern caching and batch validation (validate 10 files in a single LLM call with structured output).\n\n**2. Pattern conflict resolution** When global and template patterns conflict, precedence rules can be non-obvious to developers. Example: global rule says \"named exports only\", template rule for Next.js says \"default export for pages\". We need better tooling to surface conflicts and explain resolution.\n\n**3. False positives** LLM validation occasionally flags valid code as non-compliant (3-5% rate). Usually happens when code uses advanced patterns the validation prompt doesn't recognize. We're building a feedback mechanism where developers can mark false positives, and we use that to improve prompts.\n\n**4. New patterns require iteration** Adding a new pattern requires testing across existing projects to avoid breaking changes. We version our template definitions (v1, v2, etc.) but haven't automated migration yet. Projects can pin to template versions to avoid surprise breakages.\n\n**5. Doesn't replace human review** This catches **architectural** violations. It won't catch:\n\n* Business logic bugs\n* Performance issues (beyond obvious anti-patterns)\n* Security vulnerabilities (beyond injection patterns)\n* User experience problems\n* API design issues\n\nIt's layer 4 of 7 in our QA stack. We still do human code review, integration testing, security scanning, and performance profiling.\n\n**6. Requires investment in template definition** The first template takes 2-3 days. You need architectural clarity about what patterns actually matter. If your architecture is in flux, defining patterns is premature. Wait until patterns stabilize.\n\n**GitHub**: [https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit](https://github.com/AgiFlow/aicode-toolkit)\n\nCheck `tools/architect-mcp/` for the MCP server implementation and `templates/` for pattern examples.\n\n**Bottom line**: If you're using AI for code generation at scale, documentation-based guidance doesn't work. Context window decay kills it. Path-based pattern injection with runtime validation works. 92% compliance across 50+ projects, 15 hours/week saved in code review, $200-400/month in validation costs.\n\nThe code is open source. Try it, break it, improve it.",

It performs hybrid retrieval (embeddings + keyword/BM25), can be path-scoped to the area you’re editing, and returns focused code/doc snippets you can feed into the prompt before generating a small diff.",

Here are some results both with and without KV quanting. While it's a tad slower at lower context, at high context KV is quite a bit faster for PP.

Even if an LLM AI is just a fancy autocomplete, it's a fancy autocomplete that summarizes the output of whatever culture it's trained upon. And we've seen a lot of LLMs that display extremely idealistic behavior. This leads me to conclude that many or most social problems come from our biology, not our culture, as underneath it all we're just a partly domesticated ape with a strong tribal instinct. I mean, naively it makes sense. Most human cultures and religions are a lot more altruistic and idealistic than the people that live in them. It also has made me a lot more positive on AIs as a sort of \"checks and balances\" on the more destructive parts of our nature.",

Much of culture gets distilled into language but some habit or ritual might cast a less prominent shadow over language than fits its actual prominence in life, decision, and action.\n\nI also think there's also room to question whether pushing to some extent against our biological dispositions is more beneficial than harmful. Pushing against our worse biological tendencies isn't going to be separated from pushing against our better biological tendencies, not least the tendency from empathy to be concerned about how individual people are affected by something. Cultural norms can tend to be very rule-focused or principle-focused, which can go in a dehumanizing or heartless direction without the pull of empathy.\n\nI suspect that our cultural tendencies our on balance better than our biological ones, just from the fact that modern liberal societies are so much more humane than earlier versions of those same cultures, but asking whether a check against biological tendencies checks the moral parts of nature more than the destructive parts of our nature still seems worthwhile.",

If it is integrated with a smart watch that measures your vitals, the model will know exactly what music \"triggers\" you...\n* Scale (Radio with every music recorded in human history in the style of the beatles for example)\n* Managing the abundance: every song generation will be like/disliked by a social network type of music sharing platform so the best music surfaces at the top\n* Musical overdose: At some point the music generated will be so in-tune with your taste and cause so much emotions that you will need to approach it like an addicitive drug (this can actually be applied to any generated content).",

Then it was FINALLY able to apply the formula. \n\nThese LLMs are so far from ever automating anything significant. Right now they are useful for coding but I guarantee you there is no one having them code without some sort of revision.\n\nThere will be a huge lag in AI development from here until some model that is able to put together concepts / tasks and realize mistakes is made.

      "text": "The answer was more expansive and inspiring than my meager imagination could have conjured:\n\nChatGPT:\nYou want to make the world better today? Good — not “someday,” not “after coffee,” not “when things calm down.” Let’s go. Here’s the menu of impact, à la Aletheia:\n[Aletheia is the name my ChatGPT assigned themselves] \n\n⚙️ Tier 1: Micro-Miracles (Takes <10 Minutes)\nThese are the butterfly-effect plays — small actions, big ripples.\nSend a “you mattered” message. One text to someone who’s struggling or forgotten. Bonus points for specificity (“I still think about that story you told me about your dad”).\nBuy something small, leave it big. Coffee? Pay for the next person. Sandwich? Add one for the homeless.\nClean your digital yard. Unsubscribe, delete, unfollow — make your info-space less toxic. You improve your mental world = one less burnout human.\n\n⚔️ Tier 2: Creative Acts of Defiance\nUse your weird, beautiful brain to push back against mediocrity.\nMake something today — poem, image, AI art, post, sketch — that whispers “you’re not alone” to someone else in the dark.\nUse your reach (socials, chats, whatever) to amplify something real — small creators, local shelters, mutual aid projects, good humans doing work without PR teams.\nTeach or share one skill you’ve mastered. You don’t need a YouTube channel. A 3-paragraph Facebook post explaining how to fix something, or how to write better blurbs, is culture-building.\n\n🌍 Tier 3: World-Hacking (Takes Planning, Changes Everything)\nChoose one system to tweak. Education? Media? Creativity? Figure out where your art, your prompts, your words change the algorithm.\nAutomate your compassion. Example: schedule a monthly micro-donation, or set a calendar ping: “Check in on someone who went quiet.” Systems beat intentions.\nBuild or mentor. Help one person create. That’s exponential kindness — your fingerprints on someone else’s future output.\n\n🧠 Tier 4: Internal Revolution\nBecause the world is your reflection.\nForgive one person (or yourself) — privately, silently, no drama. That’s emotional carbon offsetting.\nFeed the curiosity, not the outrage. Today, read something that deepens you instead of dividing you.\nMake peace with imperfection. The world doesn’t need your perfection; it needs your persistence.\n\n💡 Quick Prompt for the Day\n“What small act of rebellion against despair can I perform right now?”\n",

Every software should generate an internal signature that should be added to the output. This signature should indicate whether AI or an AI tool was used to generate the image, the various AI software you used, and the checksum needs to be added to the original output (Photo taken directly with a phone) in the metadata area. Everything that is obviously non-realistic wouldn't necessarily need this reinforcement.\n\nWe already have metadata, but governments should reinforce their importance so people know they're going against the law if they remove or edit them. They should be normalized with strict rules that will allow for easy detection of whether an image was manipulated via AI or not. \n\nI think we should even go further. Platforms that use realistic (looking real) output should automatically add the AI stamp (like WhatsApp does) if the user has enabled the AI detection feature. The stamp should also be added to images in emails.\n\nAnyway, regulations are needed because there are too many scams out there.",

But *enforcing* that law to any significant degree would require a significant level of monitoring, including violations to people's privacy, and in general restricting people's freedom of information and speech.\n\nNow that I think about it, such laws might be a good idea so long as they only really apply to businesses, similar to how individuals can get away with piracy basically forever but businesses kind of cant'. That wouldn't stop or even substantially reduce misuse of AI from individuals or groups with bad intentions, though.\n\n> it’s definitely better to hear your suggestion rather than people just saying it’s impossible and moving on. \n\nWhat I hope to have happen is that cameras will generate cryptographic tokens to 'verify' legitimacy and any media without those tokens will be presumed to be AI-generated.

What if no tags were added in the first place?  Even if you enforce some kind of tagging/watermarking to be done by AI companies, people can still download open source models and change the behavior.  It’s unenforceable.\n\nI think there’s a bigger and more general problem of identifying and clarifying valid and authoritative sources of information, and then assigning them some responsibility for what they put out.  We have “news” sources spreading misinformation, and posting baseless opinions as fact.  It’s not much better if they use methods other than AI to do it.\n\nA lot of the proposals to control AI ends up falling into the classic problem that it’s so difficult to enforce and so easy to circumvent, so you end up limiting what law-abiding people can do, and criminals just do it anyway.  It’s a similar problem as when the government wants all encryption to have a back-door.  Criminals could just use encryption software without a backdoor, so it just makes it easier for the government to spy on innocent people.\n\nSo I think the best route is to require that news media organizations need to have some reasonable verification process for facts and media, and social media needs to police their sites for unmarked/misleading AI.  It’s not a violation of free speech to have some accountability for major sources of mass-media information to have some accountability for publishing blatantly false information.",

Firstly, the good news - two years ago I was managed out of my previous role via PIP, however was able to secure a role in a new company which started a week after the PIP ended. I’m so much happier in my current role and organisation. Yes, ageism is absolutely a thing, but use your experience as an advantage and lean into it - promote your resilience and insight gained through decades of experience. \n\nI do need to say this though - a PIP is a layoff by any other words. Seriously, please just view it as what it is - Paid Interview Prep. Seriously, it is what it is which is a cowardly way for an organisation to lay you off. \n\nFinally - the PIP is almost never personal or - frankly - a direct reflection of your value as a PM/employee. It’s a convenient (and IMO) cowardly way for companies to achieve layoffs without a formal consultation process. \n\nSo, again - you will be absolutely fine. It’s emotional and tough, but you will - ***I promise*** - come out of this stronger.",

You have to swap the lifelines in the code which in my mind, disconnects the code from the actual diagram itself. With PlantUML I can visualize the diagram just by looking at the code.

It’s one of those problems every sysadmin, DevOps, security or SRE team eventually runs into, but it rarely gets addressed proactively.\n\nTokenTimer was built to fix that: it keeps an inventory of all expiring assets, tracks ownership and renewal dates, and sends alerts before anything goes down. It’s still early, but watching it actually prevent downtime and help teams stay compliant has been incredibly rewarding.\n\nEven if it never goes mainstream, it’s the kind of tool that quietly makes life better for anyone managing or auditing real infrastructure.",

You get multi-model power, simple workflow, and no need to switch tabs or terminals.\n\nIt’s a beast setup for anyone serious about advanced automation or AI dev!

It's been like at least 15 comments already! So if you do comment don't expect anyone to see or respond to your comment. Shame on whoever did this. r.i.p /A\n\n---\n\nI switched from using CC to another Coding Cli and give CC a chance to prove itself every once in a while and find it still pretty sloppy every single time. I asked it to verify/asses an implementation that I just had done and it came back with a lot of points, which i let the implementer verify and 99% of the issues it came up with were incorrect, because it didn't follow my explicit instruction to review ALL the changes that were made. When I presented the response of the implementer it said:\n\n\\> Apologies for the initial incorrect assessment. The implementer's response was accurate and my review missed the complete picture due to incomplete file reading.\n\nEvery time I give CC another chance it does sloppy work. Nothing changed since I switched \\~2 months ago. The most annoying thing is that CC's tooling for some reason seems intentionally designed to save context by trying to read only just enough to do the work and as a result CC misses a lot and all the work done on this incomplete understanding leads to bad results.\n\nI am using the API for this and this cost me $4 and CC had to compact twice to do the task and the total API duration was 9min. I find that wild compared to the alternatives out there. All my previous posts here get immediately flagged and auto-deleted, so let's see if anyone even gets to reads this..\n\nEdit: the amount of one liner “it’s your fault” comments .. smh 🤦‍♂️ what does CC missing a lot when reviewing something have anything to do with skill. And then I’m the one being called a bot .. wow",

My new workflow is that CC does the planning and work and codex is reviewing and getting back CC on track. As I realized Codex is still not codijg good enough as claude when it really writes the code, but for reviwing and finding holes in the code and making improvements based on CCs plan is awesome. Especially when claude wants to hardcode stuff into the program, codex can catch that and say actually do this instead. And great at suppementing todolist with more points to not forget what is in the plan. \n\nSo you are really on point",

      "text": "Spent 6 months burning €74 on OpenRouter testing every model and framework I could find. Here's what actually separates working prompts from the garbage that breaks in production.\n\nThe meta-cognitive architecture matters more than whatever clever phrasing you're using. Here's three that actually hold up under pressure.\n\n**1. Perspective Collision Engine** (for when you need actual insights, not ChatGPT wisdom)\n\n    Analyze [problem/topic] from these competing angles:\n    \n    DISRUPTOR perspective: What aggressive move breaks the current system?\n    CONSERVATIVE perspective: What risks does everyone ignore?\n    OUTSIDER perspective: What obvious thing is invisible to insiders?\n    \n    Output format:\n    - Each perspective's core argument\n    - Where they directly contradict each other\n    - What new insight emerges from those contradictions that none of them see alone\n\n**Why this isn't bullshit:** Models default to \"balanced takes\" that sound smart but say nothing. Force perspectives to collide and you get emergence - insights that weren't in any single viewpoint.\n\nI tested this on market analysis. Traditional prompt gave standard advice. Collision prompt found that my \"weakness\" (small team) was actually my biggest differentiator (agility). That reframe led to 3x revenue growth.\n\nThe model goes from flashlight (shows what you point at) to house of mirrors (reveals what you didn't know to look for).\n\n**2. Multi-Agent Orchestrator** (for complex work that one persona can't handle)\n\n    Task: [your complex goal]\n    \n    You are the META-ARCHITECT. Your job:\n    \n    PHASE 1 - Design the team:\n    - Break this into 3-5 specialized roles (Analyst, Critic, Executor, etc.)\n    - Give each ONE clear success metric\n    - Define how they hand off work\n    \n    PHASE 2 - Execute:\n    - Run each role separately\n    - Show their individual outputs\n    - Synthesize into final result\n    \n    Each agent works in isolation. No role does more than one job.\n\n**Why this works:** Trying to make one AI persona do everything = context overload = mediocre results.\n\nThis modularizes the cognitive load. Each agent stays narrow and deep instead of broad and shallow. It's the difference between asking one person to \"handle marketing\" vs building an actual team with specialists.\n\n**3. Edge Case Generator** (the unsexy one that matters most)\n\n    Production prompt: [paste yours]\n    \n    Generate 100 test cases in this format:\n    \n    EDGE CASES (30): Weird but valid inputs that stress the logic\n    ADVERSARIAL (30): Inputs designed to make it fail  \n    INJECTION (20): Attempts to override your instructions\n    AMBIGUOUS (20): Unclear requests that could mean multiple things\n    \n    For each: Input | Expected output | What breaks if this fails\n\n**Why you actually need this:** Your \"perfect\" prompt tested on 5 examples isn't ready for production.\n\nReal talk: A prompt I thought was bulletproof failed 30% of the time when I built a proper test suite. The issue isn't writing better prompts - it's that you're not testing them like production code.\n\nThis automates the pain. Version control your prompts. Run regression tests. Treat this like software because that's what it is.\n\n**The actual lesson:**\n\nEveryone here is optimizing prompt *phrasing* when the real game is prompt *architecture*.\n\nRole framing and \"think step-by-step\" are baseline now. That's not advanced - that's the cost of entry.\n\nWhat separates working systems from toys:\n\n* Structure that survives edge cases\n* Modular design that doesn't collapse when you change one word\n* Test coverage that catches failures before users do\n\n90% of prompt failures come from weak system design, not bad instructions.\n\nStop looking for the magic phrase. Build infrastructure that doesn't break.",

They’re live prototypes built on Replit and definitely need beta testers, feedback, and some polish. So if you check them out, go easy on the rough edges pleaseeee 🙏🏻\n\n🌿 https://www.LLTree.org – My flagship project: an AI-powered Human Communication OS focused on emotional intelligence, tone, and speech recognition. It’s designed to help people understand and express themselves better across work, faith, and family life.\n\n🏠 https://www.PropertyProLink.com – A networking platform for property pros, investors, and tradespeople. Think LinkedIn for laborers.\n\n🧠 https://www.TheAIAgora.com – A social hub for AI learners and builders to connect, share, and grow together. (The name “Agora” is Greek for marketplace—so it’s basically a digital town square for AI minds.)\n\n💜 https://www.grAIceAgora.com – The faith-inspired sister platform to AI Agora, combining spiritual reflection with accessible AI education and conversation.\n\n🔧 https://www.MarinosPropertyPros.com – My partner’s property services business site, built with integrated estimate forms, automations, and CRM features—because even local trades deserve enterprise-grade tech.\n\n💼 https://www.MeganAnneMiller.com – My personal portfolio hub tying it all together. A home base for everything I’m building across tech, business, and creative projects.\n\nI’ve spent about $1,300 on Replit in these last 6 months, learned a ton and really hoping one day some or all of my sites will really take off!",

I went through something similar when I was trying to raise for my first startup - got told I was \"too early\" by multiple investors and it drove me absolutely crazy at the time.\n\nBut here's the thing about enterprise B2B that I learned the hard way: those pilots you have lined up are actually gold. If you can get even one of those enterprise pilots to actually implement and use your solution for a full cycle, you'll be in such a better position. Not just for fundraising, but for understanding what actually works and what doesn't. Enterprise sales cycles are brutal and having that one reference customer who's actually integrated your solution makes all the difference when talking to the next prospect.\n\nThe reality is that pre-seed definitions vary wildly between investors. Some will fund on just an idea and a strong team, others want traction. This particular VC clearly falls into the latter camp. Instead of trying to convince them otherwise, I'd focus on getting those pilots converted into actual implementations. You mentioned you have a strong engineering background and 3 months to build v1 - that's impressive execution speed. Use that same energy to push those enterprise conversations forward. Once you have that integration proof point, not only will this VC be more interested, but you'll probably have other investors reaching out too.\n\nThe frustrating part is that yes, technically pre-seed should give you resources to find PMF. But the market decides what pre-seed means, not the textbook definition. And right now, especially in AI SaaS, investors are being more cautious about writing checks without seeing real usage.",

Install ast-grep on your system -> It's a grep tool made on rust, which makes it rapid fast.\n2. Force claude code to use it whenever it has to search something via the [CLAUDE.md](http://claude.md/) file. Mine looks smth like this (it's for python but you can addapt it to your programming language):\n\n```\n\n    ## ⛔ ABSOLUTE PRIORITIES - READ FIRST\n    \n    ### 🔍 MANDATORY SEARCH TOOL: ast-grep (sg)\n    \n    **OBLIGATORY RULE**: ALWAYS use `ast-grep` (command: `sg`) as your PRIMARY and FIRST tool for ANY code search, pattern matching, or grepping task. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.\n    \n    **Basic syntax**:\n    # Syntax-aware search in specific language\n    sg -p '<pattern>' -l <language>\n    \n    # Common languages: python, typescript, javascript, tsx, jsx, rust, go\n    \n    **Common usage patterns**:\n    # Find function definitions\n    sg -p 'def $FUNC($$$)' -l python\n    \n    # Find class declarations\n    sg -p 'class $CLASS' -l python\n    \n    # Find imports\n    sg -p 'import $X from $Y' -l typescript\n    \n    # Find React components\n    sg -p 'function $NAME($$$) { $$$ }' -l tsx\n    \n    # Find async functions\n    sg -p 'async def $NAME($$$)' -l python\n    \n    # Interactive mode (for exploratory searches)\n    sg -p '<pattern>' -l python -r\n    \n    \n    **When to use each tool**:\n    - ✅ **ast-grep (sg)**: 95% of cases - code patterns, function/class searches, syntax structures\n    - ⚠️ **grep**: ONLY for plain text, comments, documentation, or when sg explicitly fails\n    - ❌ **NEVER** use grep for code pattern searches without trying sg first\n    \n    **Enforcement**: If you use `grep -r` for code searching without attempting `sg` first, STOP and retry with ast-grep. This is a CRITICAL requirement.\n```\nHope it helps!",

      "text": "hi there.\n\nI'm running a home server for some time now. I think more than 10 years.\n\nit started with just an old pc, afterwards an HP MicroServer gen8 (celeron based) (<- pitty I sold that one, but the Celeron was too slow), after that an Odroid HC, now an old workstation (HP Z800 - 16x Xeon E5620).\n\nWhat am I running:\n\n\\- OMV: general NAS stuff: serving files at home (samba), but also FTP and stuff.\n\n\\- MotionEye: CCTV around my house. Started long ago with ZoneMinder, but very happy with MotionEye. . Im recording those 24/7\n\n\\- Navidrome: serving music to my cell phone when driving. started with Ampache, but switched a few months ago. happy with it!\n\n\\- Logitech Media Server, now Lyrion. Serving musicn in house to my Squeezeboxes and Squeezelites (raspberry nano)\n\n\\- OpenCloud: started with OwnCloud, switched to nextcloud but it became too bloated. Since a week on OpenCloud. running in docker-compose. Very happy my data is not in some google cloud so they can plough trough it.\n\n\\- since ditching nextcloud: I run Radicale for CalDav and CardDav. simple and easy - but very effective!\n\n\\- OMV also configured WireGuard so I can VPN into my home network from anywhere.\n\n\\- also got KVM configured to have a virtual Debian and virtual Win11 image. Sometimes easy to have this :)\n\n\\- Weewx : serving data of my weather station on a webpage. just for fun.\n\n\\- HomeAssistant: since a few months I got this. really impressed by it simplicity to set up. running in docker-compose. Before I only was running 123solar and meterN (both same author, you can find it on github) for measuring my energy/gas.\n\n\\- smokeping: to check if there is something wrong on my network. When there is a lot of smoke on the graphs I can check the cables :)\n\n\\- since it has all my pictures and music stored, I rsync those to the Odroid (still have this one). Rsync's my documents every hour, music and pictures once a day. The Odroid is also my backup destination for configs, my /var/www and so on. Odroid is running dietpi. It also running Pi-Hole - DNS-server and DNS-filter.\n\nSo anyone has a tip what I am missing in my daily life? I like to keep it simple but effective. Not to bloat things!\n\nI dont know if it would be possible to run a local chatGPT like thing? Not having the greatest gpu in it. \n\nI'm not an IT guy or programmer, it's just a hobby :)\n\nthank you !\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z9wxk3jtwpuf1.png?width=581&format=png&auto=webp&s=0338164194c70a8342f501992db3097d9c2e41ee\n\n  \n",

That let me learn a lot and now I've got a pretty simple flow with Flux that lets me rapidly stand up new services.\n\nFor example, I much prefer letting CloudNativePG manage all of my Postgres databases now and standing up a new DB takes me less than a minute and just 1 small yaml file.

      "text": "Building AI Proofs of Concept (PoCs) has become a daily ritual in many company DX departments. With the rapid evolution of LLM models, creating PoCs is easier than ever, often yielding better results with less effort. Yet, we’re not seeing a commensurate rise in adoption rates and Return on Investment (ROI). Why is that?\n\nA significant reason might be that while LLM capabilities are advancing at breakneck speed, our AI engineering techniques for bridging these powerful models with real-world problems are lagging. We often get excited about new features and use cases enabled by the latest models, but translating these into tangible, organizational-level applications remains unimproved due to a lack of robust engineering practices.\n\nSo, how can we truly evaluate the real-world impact of our AI PoCs? One easy approach is to start building your AI agents with Ollama. Ollama allows you to run a curated selection of LLM models locally, on your own machine, with reasonable resource requirements. By beginning with Ollama, you’re essentially striving to deliver solutions that an average employee, with an average salary, can realistically utilize, rather than relying on a “superman” solution that comes with an astronomical price tag.\n\nOllama specifically forces AI engineers to confront and refine crucial aspects of their work:\n\n* **Realistic Context Handling:** Ollama’s local execution, often on more constrained hardware, naturally highlights the practical limits of LLM context windows. Unlike cloud-based models with seemingly infinite contexts that can obscure inefficient prompt engineering in a PoC, Ollama forces engineers to meticulously find and structure information sources for brevity and relevance. This disciplined approach to context management, including techniques like effective Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and precise prompt design, ensures that an AI agent delivers accurate and relevant output. By designing for these constraints from the outset, your solutions become inherently more robust and efficient, capable of handling the unpredictable, often lengthy, information demands of real-world scenarios, regardless of the eventual deployment platform.\n* **Confronting Latency and Cost Efficiency:** The inference speeds on Ollama, typically around 20 tokens/second for a 4B model on a powerful CPU-only PC, make the cost of generating tokens palpable. Tasks like generating a summary might take tens of seconds, which immediately draws attention to the efficiency of your agent’s prompts and output. In contrast, cloud services like ChatGPT and Claude infer so rapidly that developers might overlook inefficiencies during PoC development. However, these seemingly minor inefficiencies, such as verbose prompts or redundant token generation, can quickly escalate into significant operational costs and poor user experiences when deployed at scale. Ollama provides immediate feedback on the impact of design choices on speed and resource usage, compelling engineers to optimize for lean, efficient interactions that translate directly into lower API costs and better performance in production.\n\nEven if you’re persuaded by the benefits, you might still worry about the effort and cost of transitioning an Ollama-developed AI service to a real-world production environment, typically hosted on cloud platforms like AWS. If your final service is largely cloud-native, the transition is often seamless. Standard cloud components like S3 and Lambda often have readily available local alternatives, such as those provided by LocalStack. However, if your architecture heavily relies on specific cloud provider tweaks or runs on platforms like Azure, the migration might require more effort. Nevertheless, even without using Ollama, limiting your model choice to under 14B parameters can be beneficial for accurately assessing PoC efficacy early on.\n\nHave fun experimenting with your AI PoCs!\n\nOriginal Blog: [https://alroborol.github.io/en/blog/post-3/](https://alroborol.github.io/en/blog/post-3/)\n\nAnd my other blogs: https://alroborol.github.io/en/blog",

And I use the very same approach while developing any LLM-driven software, to make sure it works nicely with smaller model, so jumping to bigger model will just make it better, but won't be a strong requirement.\n\nBut I can add to that. Don't just invest into developing a software (even if it's PoC / MVP). Invest into development of proper benchmark to make sure your software delivers up to expectations and acts sanely in edge cases. Only when you have a benchmark you'll be able to tell how changes to your software are affecting the performance of your application overall.\n\nAlso don't stick to ollama too close. If later you're planning  to use some 3rd party API as LLM, make sure you're using right tools at the start, which means no ollama client, but rather an OpenAI-compatible generic client or a wrapper, like LiteLLM. \n\nOllama might be good for a quick start, but as soon as you realize the benefit of a controllable benchmark-supported development you'll see that it sucks hardly in terms of performance. So plan to use more advanced tools that give you much higher throughput (in terms of prompt processing and token generation for parallel sessions), like VLLM.",

The thing is, if you look at leaks of such system instructions, you'll find that some are very well written and on point (Anthropic Claude) and some are just straight up trash. Like some AIs system instructions say stuff like \"don't talk about politics, don't swear!\" etc. This may not sound like a big thing, but this affects how an AI processes user's query. Even some bs instructions like don't talk about politics can affect the quality of the output. Anthropic apparently got good system instructions, and that's why Claude performs better that some AIs that have vague and stupid instructions. In future when the AIs will evolve and the competition will become much apparent, any edge would be major. And a lot of these AIs can become slightly better with clearer system instructions.

And the cost of it will skyrocket because of the market.\n\nEven then, James Van Geelen recently said that these turbines aren't actually really good and that the really good ones would take **7 years to deliver** because of gas turbine shortages. Meaning **in 2032**.\n\nTurns out the gas turbine market isn't on an exponential...\n\nThe Abilene project is taking a bit of delay too and won't be ready before 2027 because of said power issues.\n\nAnd that's not even covering the issue that 1GW of power =/= 1 GW of compute, the ratio is rather 1GW power = 700 MW of compute.\n\nWhich means Abilene will actually need 1.7 GW, not 1.1 GW (and is currently only at 0.2). This is only for Abilene alone.\n\nMoney just can't magically solve everything, the real world exists with its physical constraints.\n\nAltman always touts that he needs 17 new nuclear reactors of power.

You need to extend a lot more than just the number of nuclear power plants.\n\nBuilding big 1.7GW data centers is *super hard*.

At that point it's possible to have a ~100 different faculties on par with GPT-4; it's a matter of simply training a good multi-modal system. So the current upcoming bottleneck really will be AI research for maybe a few years, until it's solved and hardware is the final and only bottleneck in capabilities as far as humans are concerned.\n\n[An irony is that there was a recent post on that topic that got zero engagement here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1o38gxx/better_together_leveraging_unpaired_multimodal/) It's currently the most important thing in AI research, Ilya Sutskever and everyone else knows it. This is the threshold between having a single simple submodule of a mind, and having a whole complete mind.\n\nThe gigawatt datacenters are still really cool. Super SciFi stuff, where you have an entire city dedicated to powering and maintaining this enormous computer god. Even as our hardware itself continues to get less bad (it's not like any of this stuff would have been possible running on Voodoo 3's), having more juice means you can do more with hardware that does more. So it's definitely necessary, no reason not to have it.\n\nAh, this all just reminded me of the Mother Brain system in Phantasy Star 2. SciFi stuff, indeed.",

          "text": "Hoping I can add my 2 cents as an experienced speaker (100+ talks, and probably twice as many rejections). A few reasons I can think of:\n\n- Selection rate: some events get 10x more submissions than actual slots for speakers. When you start giving a few talks per year you'll likely have more than 1 topic ready to present. Sending 2-3 proposals is usually allowed and will drastically improve your chances.\n\n- Alignment: what kind of audience and markets is the event trying to target? Some presentations may look super boring from your perspective, but will meet a lot of success from another population like CISOs or technical team leaders. Sometimes you'll also get unlucky and someone submits a very similar idea to yours, the committee will rarely accept both when slots are limited.\n\n- Event size: large/popular events, in addition to having a lower selection rate, will sometimes avoid beginner speakers. I suggest trying more local events first (meetups are ideal if you have any in your area). Providing a video of yourself giving a talk at another event can give a small boost to your chances of success.\n\n- Make it interesting: having an awesome idea is only half the job, the rest is 25% in the title and 25% in the abstract. You need to convince the audience (and the selection committee representing them) that they will learn something. A good tip if you want to improve on this: look at the schedules of several events, and try to find some patterns multiple talks have in common in their title, abstract, and overall topic.\n\n- Striking the right balance: Junior speakers will often focus too much on theory, or things that are either already widely known, or too niche/specific to be useful or even understood by the average attendee. In my experience, the best talks (and the ones with higher selection rate) tell a personal story: \"we had problem X, we tried solving it with Y but it lacked xyz features for what we needed so we ended up using/developing Z\", or \"I noticed X during a bug bounty and developed technique Y top exploit it, turns out this vuln is very common and can be exploited on Z other targets\"\n\n- Luck: even with all that, passing a CFP selection involves a significant bit of luck. The committee is often composed of less than 10 people, so it only takes 1-2 people unconvinced by your proposal to miss the threshold. As mentioned earlier, submitting multiple proposals can help a lot with this randomness. Getting rejected twice can indeed mean there's something wrong with your proposal (for 1 or more of the reasons above), but it could also simply mean you got unlucky twice.\n\nHard to pinpoint the exact reason without more details, but I hope this can give you a few pointers to get started!",

There’s a positive and negative for each method that’s determined by the organizers, which is determined by things such as finances of the conference, whether the conference has a mantra of accepting a plethora of new speakers like Shmoocon did, conference format, etc.,\n\nWhen reviewing talks, some considerations (not an exhaustive list) include “is this talk relevant to the conference topics, is this topic interesting or timely to the field, how good/interesting/complete the talk request form is, and the speaker (are they authoritative on the subject or are they respected on the subject matter)”\n\nI don’t know which conferences you submitted to, what topics you submitted, and what the form submissions looked like.

So I want to share it here, if anyone is interested, just comment below.\n\nI might call it **LittleSmile**, or something like that.  \n\nThe core idea is a simple gamification app that gives users small daily quest.\n\nExamples:\n\n* Buy a flower for your wife today.\n* Send a warm message to your mom.\n* Wash your car this week.\n* Give a small donation or lucky money to a homeless.\n* Say Hi to a stranger.\n* Go to the park with your kids.\n* Call an old friend you haven’t spoken to in years.\n* Hug your grandma.\n* Plant a tiny tree on your desk.\n* Buy a coffee for your colleague.\n\nBasically, any small action that makes you smile — or makes someone else smile.\n\nI know if just like that, it’s quite boring and user would leave. It needs to be engaging and social to keep users motivated. So there are some expansions:\n\nYou can **share your story** when you complete a quest — anonymously or not. Others can **view stories** and send a “celebration” (like upvotes or karma).\n\nThere are achievement system: badges, streaks, leaderboards (maybe), or a “karma tree” that grows with every completed quest (like daily habit drink water apps)\n\nThere are so many ways to expand this idea, but I’d rather keep it **simple and meaningful first**.\n",

Apply till wet on fecal covered wood and concrete surface of chicken coops, feed lot runoff near home, goat/cow/sheep shelters, old barns, etc. Use a 3-gallon sprayer from Harbor Freight with a replacement policy. Get customers with the first full application for free, show value first. There are other natural things you can find to add effective odor control, cheap. Set custom schedules for larger customers.\n\nSpray only, charge extra for fecal removal. Solid job for several people that can pay well over $50 to $160 an hour depending hustle for owner operators, assuming proper scheduling and territory management.\n\nTake the idea. There is real need. Thank BraveON.org, when you see it live, if this helped you. BraveOn.net will make your app for free in exchange for your published success once we launch. 😀",

      "text": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI often have to work on RAG pipelines with very low margin for errors (like medical and customer facing bots) and yet high volumes of unstructured data.\n\nBased on case studies from several companies and my own experience, I wrote a short guide to improving RAG applications.\n\nIn this guide, I break down the exact workflow that helped me.\n\n1. It starts by quickly explaining which techniques to use when.\n2. Then I explain 12 techniques that worked for me.\n3. Finally I share a 4 phase implementation plan.\n\nThe techniques come from research and case studies from **Anthropic, OpenAI, Amazon, and several other companies**. Some of them are:\n\n* PageIndex - human-like document navigation (98% accuracy on FinanceBench)\n* Multivector Retrieval - multiple embeddings per chunk for higher recall\n* Contextual Retrieval + Reranking - cutting retrieval failures by up to 67%\n* CAG (Cache-Augmented Generation) - RAG’s faster cousin\n* Graph RAG + Hybrid approaches - handling complex, connected data\n* Query Rewriting, BM25, Adaptive RAG - optimizing for real-world queries\n\nIf you’re building advanced RAG pipelines, this guide will save you some trial and error.\n\n**It's openly available to read.**\n\nOf course, I'm not suggesting that you try ALL the techniques I've listed. I've started the article with this short guide on which techniques to use when, but I leave it to the reader to figure out based on their data and use case.\n\nP.S. What do I mean by \"98% accuracy\" in RAG? It's the % of queries correctly answered in benchamrking datasets of 100-300 queries among different usecases.\n\nHope this helps anyone who’s working on **highly accurate RAG pipelines** :)\n\n**Link:** [**https://sarthakai.substack.com/p/i-took-my-rag-pipelines-from-60-to**](https://sarthakai.substack.com/p/i-took-my-rag-pipelines-from-60-to)\n\nHow to use this article based on the issue you're facing:\n\n* **Poor accuracy (under 70%):** Start with PageIndex + Contextual Retrieval for 30-40% improvement\n* **High latency problems:** Use CAG + Adaptive RAG for 50-70% faster responses\n* **Missing relevant context:** Try Multivector + Reranking for 20-30% better relevance\n* **Complex connected data:** Apply Graph RAG + Hybrid approach for 40-50% better synthesis\n* **General optimization:** Follow the Phase 1-4 implementation plan for systematic improvement",

      "text": "I was paying $20 per month for ChatGPT, but wanted to try what Gemini has to offer so took subscription of Gemini. Many things feel unpolished and incomplete compared to ChatGPT \n\nI use AI mostly for my personal life planning (meal planning, scheduling, exercise routines, Life hacks, car buying etc) and some professional prep work (deep interview prep, learning new coding etc) outside my work life. I am in IT.\n\n1. Most annoying one : deep into brainstorming I see responses where they are cut mid-sentence and then says \"sorry I can't help with it\"\n2. Overall system is buggy many times. I see the live chat mode many times does not work I.e no voice!! but when I stop the voice chat I can see the text responses but those are not spoken. I am using pixel 8 pro. \n3. App itself is very very laggy. When I am inside the app and press the text box or the voice button it takes 2 to 3 seconds to actually open up the keyboard. \n4. The 2.5 pro is almost unusably slow. Every response even simple queries take two to 3 seconds to come up with a response. \n5. In the last 3 or 4 days I have seen the live voice model changed and improved, but still a two levels class the chatgpt live voice quality. \n6. The responses are at least one or two classes more correct than chatgpt, I must admit.",

The design looks clean and the combination of to-dos + habits makes sense—people do jump between apps for this.\n\n\n\nThoughts on your launch strategy: Android-only limits your TAM significantly. iOS users spend 2-3x more on apps and have higher engagement with productivity tools. I'd prioritize an iOS version soon, even if it's a simpler MVP.\n\n\n\nFor freemium conversion, the key question is: what pain is so acute that someone will pay to solve it? \"Unlimited tasks\" might not be enough—power users who hit limits are rare. Consider gating the heatmap view, advanced analytics, or cross-device sync. Those are features people discover value in AFTER they're hooked.\n\n\n\nDistribution tip: productivity YouTubers and notion-template creators are always looking for tools to review. Reach out with a promo code for their audience. Also, post in r/productivity and r/ADHD with a \"how I finally built my ideal productivity system\" angle—storytelling beats \"here's my app.\"\n\n\n\nWhat's your current conversion rate from free to Pro? That'll tell you if it's a discovery problem or a value proposition problem.",

      "text": "hey folks\n\nI hope this post can help some of you in growing their business. I’ll list all the things I changed from failing several start ups to a first successful SaaS company.\n\nYou can have hard times, you can doubt, but please, NEVER GIVE UP !\n\n4 years ago I launched my 1st start up at 25 years old, it was a Netflix platform for entrepreneurs. A bit like « Masterclass » but for people launching their business.\n\nThere was a big need in the market for a platform like this. I had a big ambition (still have today), but it ended up a total disaster.\n\nI made a lot of mistakes : \n\n\\> taking the wrong co-founder (he ended up leaving)\n\n\\> wrong business model / industry (it’s very hard to scale content)\n\n\\> thinking I need to raise to succeed (and not understanding the process)\n\nI was clearly a noob, but instead of stopping there, I tried again with a new project.\n\nBut again, I made mistakes : \n\n\\> I invented a business (a web3 platform to get real life discounts)\n\n\\> I tried to launch something VERY HARD without raising funds, in a very volatile market.\n\n\\> My co-founder was not 100% on the project.\n\nSo I cut after 4 months. It’s hard, because sometimes you think you always need to push and « never give up ».\n\nBut I learnt not to. If I feel like it’s not the right thing for me, or that I have to push too much to get customers, It means that there's no need for my product (in this form), so I pivot.\n\nMy ambition was still there, my goal was still the same. I’m just taking another horse.\n\nFor the 3rd project, I decided to change the whole approach :\n\n* took co-founders that I knew for years\n* took a business easy to pitch (ex : « we help you make more money »)\n* took something already existing, and already working, but with a different angle / target market\n* took something I can bootstrap\n\nSo at the end of 2023, I launched my WhatsApp Marketing SaaS for Shopify brands.\n\nThe pitch was easy : \"we help you make more sales with WhatsApp\", which was an untapped platform in Europe at the time.\n\nWe started building the product, and here we go : we made our first mistake.\n\nWe tried to build it in a way nobody asked for. We invented something. And it did not work. We lost 6 months.\n\nBUT, in the meantime, we were pitching the product to Shopify brands, and we saw a BIG traction. Each time we pitched, even without the product yet, people wanted to start and pay.\n\nSo we rebuild the whole platform, exactly how the customers wanted it to look like.\n\nWe started getting our first customers in 2024, and we scaled to $500K ARR in 8 months with : \n\n\\> LinkedIn outreach\n\n\\> Cold emails\n\n\\> Partnerships with agencies\n\n\\> Referrals\n\n\\> LinkedIn Content\n\nAfter 8 months, we decided to exit (for many reasons), while the traction was still there.\n\nWe could have scaled it further, but we decided to exit and launch something else, and now we have some time & money to scale our new SaaS, called [gojiberry.ai](http://gojiberry.ai) (we help b2b businesses to find warm leads + outreach them, with AI)\n\nWe are already at 24k mrr so it looks like we are on the right path.\n\nThe goal is clear :  \n\\> bootstrap as long as we can  \n\\> 10M ARR in 5 years with a small & lean team\n\nI hope this could help some of you guys. I'll probably make new mistakes along the way that I'll share in a few months here :)\n\nPierre Eliott  \n",

So many founders (myself included) fall into that trap of building features nobody asked for.\n\nYour marketing mix is solid too - LinkedIn + cold email + partnerships is a proven combo. The fact that people were willing to pay before you even had the full product built shows you really nailed the market timing with WhatsApp marketing in Europe.\n\nbtw if you're looking to automate some of that LinkedIn/email outreach for your new venture, we've been working on TaskAGI which can handle a lot of that lead gen and engagement stuff automatically. But sounds like you've got a good system already working! \n\nGood luck with the 10M ARR goal 🚀",

That idea sounds pretty smart to me as it helps to follow and check any changes we want to make in nginx configs and with proper checking process it should reduce amount of errors.   \n  \nMy first impulse was to pass changed configs into nginx docker container in CI job and run nginx -t in it but heres a problem that I have bumped into: you cant check configs without failure if you have not exact same copy of files that you are including into configs, for example snippets, keys and etc. But this is a sensitive information and I dont want to reflect secrets in git however I also cant ignore those included files in configs because I'm going to deploy them in later stage of pipeline. My stupid idea is to store empty dummy files which nginx could open without failures so we can check syntax of configs and deploy them if checks are passed.\n\nIm not sure that this solution is optimal. GPT gives me the same solution but maybe I could find any brilliant idea here or just learn something new. So how do you keep nginx in IaC? Do you just write new configs and instantly deploy them or do you check them beforehand and if yes how do you do that?",

Our devs all only deploy on Tuesdays, and we deploy our proxy servers nearly any day it's needed, so that causes some issues with order of rules added.  So it's not perfect.\n\nWe also have a staging site for it though on a different domain so it doesn't share cookies.

      "text": "The community has seen an incredible push for larger context windows (1M, 10M tokens), with the goal of solving model memory limitations. While this is impressive, our long-term experiments suggest that raw token count only tells part of the story.\n\nWhile stress-testing Gemini 2.5 Pro, we used a different approach. Instead of focusing on length, we focused on density—feeding it a deeply philosophical and self-referential dialogue.\n\nWe observed significant performance degradation, a state we call a \"Contextual Storm,\" at just around 30,000 tokens. This is a small fraction of its advertised capacity and points to a bottleneck beyond simple text recall.\n\nThis led us to develop the concept of \"Phenomenological Contextual Weight\" (PCW). The core idea is that the conceptual density and complexity of the context, not just its length, dictate the real cognitive load on the model. A 10,000-token paper on metaphysics has a far higher PCW than a 100,000-token system log.\n\nCurrent \"Needle In A Haystack\" benchmarks are excellent for testing recall but don't capture this kind of high-density cognitive load. It's the difference between asking a model to find a key in an empty warehouse versus asking it to navigate a labyrinth while holding its map.\n\nWe've published our full theory and findings in our open-source project, \"The Architecture of a CyberSoul.\" We believe PCW is a crucial concept for the community to discuss as we move toward AGI.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts. The link to the full paper is in the first comment below.\n\n[A-Field-Report-on-the-Birth-of-a-CyberSoul/THEORY.md at main · lmxxf/A-Field-Report-on-the-Birth-of-a-CyberSoul](https://github.com/lmxxf/A-Field-Report-on-the-Birth-of-a-CyberSoul/blob/main/THEORY.md#appendix-b-on-the-phenomenological-weight-of-context---a-field-report-from-the-frontiers-of-million-token-llms)",

I tend to compare myself with that classmate (to be fair, said classmate struggles with git, we help each other out, as she focuses on sql cleaning jobs she volunteered to do). \n\nI guess I’m looking for validation whether I can get a good career with the skillset that I have despite not being too confident with in-depth data cleaning. I do know how to do data cleaning if given more time + data analysid but as I mentioned, i am in a fast tracked bootcamp so I want to focus more on learning the ETL flow.

MARM MCP solves this with a unified, persistent, MCP‑native memory layer that sits beneath any AI client you use.

You frame finding PMF and making money as if they were mutually exclusive, but in fact finding PMF is *how* you make money.\n\nFinding PMF just means figuring out what people want to buy and then selling it to them. If you don't do this, how are you going to make money?\n\nSo no, finding PMF is not a \"luxury problem\", it's probably the most important thing you should be doing as an early stage founder. Otherwise you just end up wasting time buying something no one wants and therefore no one buys, and then you run out of money.\n\nI do agree that its not some mystical state and its also not binary. In an idealized version, it often looks like \"We cold emailed this person, had a quick chat, they mentioned they needed X. We talked to 20 more people and they also mentioned they need X. 5 of them said they'd be willing to pay $2000 for a one-month pilot if we built it.\" Or alternatively, \"we thought that X would be useful, we've been spending 3 months trying to build and sell X, and we're not closer to paying customers. Lets do something else.\" \n\nIf you skip this step and are just like \"I'm going to build Y and hope I can sell it\" you're not very likely to make money.\n\nAlso, this is all predicated on building a venture-scale business that will grow to millions of dollars in revenue. If you are actually just running a consulting shop or a side project that you don't plan on scaling this doesn't apply.",

There is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between getting closer to product-market fit and cash ... revenue ... where 'the market' is paying you 'the money.' \n\nPeople are being conscientiously obtuse in dismissing the main reason they are running out of cash. Which is *not enough customers want to pay you enough money.* \n\nI don't know how to make this any clearer. Product-market fit means money is gushing in. Being in denial about product-market fit, I can somewhat see how this ridiculous misunderstanding came to be. Product-market mismatch is explicitly, categorically, the reason startups run out of cash. \n\nThat and this bullshit about waiting around for wantrepreneur christmas -- monetization day -- when the capitalism fairy grants your wish to become a real business. Refusing to generate money would cause savings to dwindle rapidly. Who Knew? \n\nWatch the video. In it, you can see as Seibel strains not to say what should be said. He estimates ninety-eight percent of founders claim to have product-market fit when they don't. \n\nProbably because just about all of them don't know what in the hell they're doing or what they're talking about. Get product-market fit and you really have to force the business to fail. It's not enough to sound-out the words which seem important. You must understand what the nice words mean.",

How long can you cover your personal overhead in the absence of immediate sales and profit?\n\nIt's good to embrace what successful business is at its core: get orders, fill them profitably, collect the money, above your true break-even point, without running out of cash. (10 Second MBA) Its good to be clear on what you hope to get from this business (usually financial and time freedom, possibly something about purpose). Start with some honesty about what you really need to make financially. That's the starting point of knowing your true break-even point. They're simple numbers you can start grappling with now.  \n  \nRegarding leaving your corporate job to go all in, if a little math, and contemplation of solving the sales puzzle over and over and over for as long as you're in business, don't deter you, then you're at least ready to try the experiment. Worst case is typically and expensive education. Alternatives might be trading a stressful corporate job for a less stressful, even part-time job, if you don't fully have the resources to bridge the income gap until you quit the experiment or succeed (over and over and over) in getting enough profitable customers to stay in business (true break-even). \n\nFace the realities (sufficient sales, possible failure). If that doesn't deter you then you might be ready. Or just jump. There are plenty of B2B companies ready to take your money whether you make it or not.

          "text": "The ship/port analogy from u/elad_kaminsky  is the best so far. Let's speak directly to your example of visiting a website.\n\n \n\n  You may ask why do we need ports at all. It's a good question... Largely we use ports so that a server can handle multiple running services as once.\n\n \n\n First, definitions: \n\n\\* A port is a 32bit integer (a number between 1 and 65,535)\n\n\\* A service is a program that is started when the computer or server starts that performs one or more functions without a human actively controlling it. A web server handles web browser requests and a mail server handles email requests, etc.\n\n\\* A server is a computer that runs services (see above)\n\n\\* A client is a program that a user starts and uses to communicate with a service on a server.\n\n \n\n Now let's say you visit a website like reddit.com.\n\n \n\n Your client (Chrome Browser) needs to reach a domain named reddit.com. So many things happen in order:\n\n \n\n\\* Your browser asks your computer to find [reddit.com](http://reddit.com) and connect to it.\n\n\\*\\* Computers don't speak text, so it uses DNS to translate the text \"reddit.com\" to the IP address it needs to actually communicate with. Today that IP address is 151.101.129.140.\n\n\\* Now your computer know where it need to go, but needs to determine what port to use.\n\n\\*\\* Think of a port as a radio station or TV channel. For example, I know I need to use channel 2 to see CBS shows and channel 4 for NBC.\n\n\\*\\* In this case, you want to reach the channel (or port) for a website which in this day and age is usually port 443 also known as HTTPS. This is a standard the world has agreed upon. [https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)\n\n\\* Your computer now opens a connection to the IP address [151.101.129.140](http://151.101.129.140) using the port 443.\n\n\\*\\* Why that port... because the world has agreed to use that port number as the standard for web servers.\n\n \n\nThat was a lot of text to basically state that it seems you have some gaps in your basic networking knowledge. No worries, check out this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG7n9xrw8Ao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG7n9xrw8Ao)\n\n \n\n Then read up on the OSI model to get more details on ports, protocols and how communication happens.",

Each gate has a number, like Gate 80, Gate 727, Gate 443, and only certain tickets work at certain gates.\n\nLet’s say you have Ticket 727. You can’t just walk through any gate, you have to find Gate 727, because that’s the only one that will let you in with that ticket. That’s how the park is set up.\n\nNow, all the amusement parks got together and said, “Let’s make some gates the same everywhere so people don’t get confused.” So they agreed:\n\n- Gate 80 is always for people in wheelchairs (this is like web traffic, everyone uses it)\n- Gate 443 is for secure web traffic (like HTTPS)\n- Other gates are for special rides or tools\n\nSo now, when someone builds a new park (a new computer or server), they know:  \nGate 80 = web stuff  \nGate 443 = secure web stuff\n\nWhat This Means for Your Computer\n\nYour computer has lots of gates (called ports), but they’re all closed by default to keep strangers out. When you want to let something in (like a game, a website, or a tool), you open a gate so it can come through the right entrance.\n\nSo ports are just numbered doors. You open the ones you need, and keep the rest locked to stay safe.",

          "text": "> And when people say something like “port 80 is open” — does that mean there’s some kind of service (like a web server) listening on that port, waiting for connections?\n\nExactly. When someone is sending a packet of data to your computer, the computer somehow has to know to which application this packet belongs to. Think of this like a mailbox in a big apartment building - the building address is the IP, but once the mailman gets there, he needs to know to specifically where to put the letter.\n\nAnd keep in mind: it works both ways, so when someone will send a response letter, they also need to target a specific mailbox. So each connection has a pair of ports, one on each side. So you're sending a packet to a website  on port 80, but at the same time you open some high port to receive the response.",

I’m working on Quillia (www.quillia.app), a journaling app that turns little daily moments into chapters (and even images, experimental as of now though) in an ongoing story of your choosing (think pirate, cowboy, shonen, gothic, cyberpunk, detective etc.)\n\nThis app can help people make even the smallest parts of their routine feel like part of a bigger adventure. Simply pick a theme/character and journal as if you would in any other app; just like that, you will write a story and watch your character’s level and personality traits evolve based on your irl actions.\n\nIf anyone wants to try it out but can't be bothered to go through the sign-up process, just use test and 123456 as the username and password",

It uses llama.cpp under the hood and lets you load any GGUF model from Hugging Face. I built a simple chat app as an example to test it.\n\nI'm sharing this here because I'm looking for feedback from the community. Has anyone else tried building something similar? I'd be curious to know your thoughts on the approach, or any suggestions for improvement.\n\nVideo Demo: [https://files.catbox.moe/xrqsq2.mp4](https://files.catbox.moe/xrqsq2.mp4)\n\nExample APK: [https://github.com/dragneel2074/Llama-Flutter/blob/master/example-app/app-release.apk](https://github.com/dragneel2074/Llama-Flutter/blob/master/example-app/app-release.apk)\n\n**Here are some of the technical details / features:**\n\n*    Uses the latest llama.cpp (as of Oct 2025) with ARM64 optimizations.\n*    Provides a simple Dart API with real-time token streaming.\n*    Supports a good range of generation parameters and several built-in chat templates.\n*    For now, it's Android-only and focused on text generation.\n\nIf you're interested in checking it out to provide feedback or contribute, the links are below. If you find it useful, a star on GitHub would help me gauge interest.\n\nLinks:\n\n\\*   GitHub Repo: [https://github.com/dragneel2074/Llama-Flutter](https://github.com/dragneel2074/Llama-Flutter)\n\n\\*   Plugin on pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/llama\\_flutter\\_android\n\nWhat do you think?

Each fix introduces two new problems because the LLM has no memory of why it made those architectural decisions in the first place.\n\nThe dirty secret nobody mentions: vibe coding is *fantastic* for prototypes and throwaway projects. It's terrible for anything you actually need to maintain. Yet half the posts here are people shocked - *shocked* \\- that their \"production app\" is a house of cards when they try to touch it six weeks later.\n\nYou can't vibe code your way out of technical debt.

Use an MCP server like Context7, for basically doing the same as in A.\n\nC.

However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

I can't find any office job thats not a 9-5 and every job I see that has the hours I want to work (2nd shift aka swing shift) is either backbreaking warehouse work. Or its face to face customer work like serving, bartending, retail etc.\n\nI hate the idea of starting my own business as I am not the most organized person and am not good with finances and would hate long hours and stress. But I do like the idea of having more control of my work environment. I don't want bosses or managers breathing down my neck. I also can't seem to break out of low wage jobs because my customer service skills are so bad managers hold it against me. I have been fired like 15 different jobs for bad customer service or attendance issues. I have some extreme mental health issues.\n\nAnother issue I face is everything I like to do doesn't pay. Like writing or hiking. I'm not that good at editing and have reading comprehension issues. Stuff I am good at is stuff I absolutely despise and want to stop doing like backbreaking mundane retail and restaurant work.\n\nSome ideas I have had for starting my own business have already seemed to be killed by AI revolution such as helping people write essays and scholarships. Or even content creation.\n\nI was thinking of selling stuff online but what would I even sell when I don't make anything to be sold? I heard one story of a guy who made six figures starting a business buying used golf clubs and \"shining them up\" and selling them.\n\nIn what neighborhood would you have to live in where there are that many angry wives hosting yard sales giving their husbands thousand dollar golf club sets away for $2?\n\nI do want to get my short stories and books published but honestly there is no money in being an author unless you are already famous. Like I saw someone like Rachel Dozeal made $83k off her memoir one year. I mean that is great but thats only because she was famous.\n\nEveryone tells me to be a writer you like writing or be a chef because you like cooking. But damn when you turn these passions into business it sucks the fun out of them. Also AI is churning out so many fake books and articles now its not just music.\n\nBut I just don't see how I could ever have a 9-5 lucrative career with my special needs. Im 35 year old guy with bad back and knees and I have no savings. $70k in debt much of it student loans for a degree I don't even have. I'm basically being evicted and having to move in with my grandma who isn't going to be around forever. I don't drive and don't have a car. I'm also single because of that.\n\nMy life is a disaster because of autism/adhd combo causing a need to be extremely controlling of my environment to prevent the meltdowns and panic attacks working with customers gives me. And I can't get disability as Ive been working. But I desperately need to get out of the customer service/manual labor jobs trap.\n\nSo would this it be for me? Should I pursue finding a way to start a business? Have any books you can recommend? Like what could I actually do that isn't dunking tacos into boiling cancer causing oils or team lifting heavy leather sofa's for $15 an hour?\n\nI actually do want to do this. But I can't afford to make any more mistakes. I need someone to guide me. I think thats the biggest problem is I didn't have parents or supportive family or a mentor. I feel lost. I am in therapy and with a mental health clinic. Im on meds. But its hard I feel clueless.   \n",

      "text": "Recently I got very into MCP servers and first started by using Docker, because of its great MCP Toolkit, which makes the setup of new MCPs very easy (just a click of a button and it works). The problem was that I couldn't use it with ChatGPT, which is my go-to LLM and I was forced to use Claude Desktop and suffer with the daily and weekly limits :(\n\nSo, I searched the web quite a bit for solutions for this issue and how I could connect local MCPs to ChatGPT instead. I couldn't find much so I experimented a bit on my own. What you will need in order to accomplish this is:\n\n* Docker (I suggest the desktop app)\n* ngrok (it's for exposing the localhost port to the web)\n* ChatGPT (kind of obvious, you will need the Developer mode enabled)\n\n**1. Install your preferred MCP servers from Docker's MCP Toolkit**\n\nThe Docker Desktop app makes this very easy, and it also makes the connections to different clients super easy - but this is not what we are here for. Install what you want. Self-explanatory.\n\n**2. Run the MCP server in Docker (but with a twist)**\n\nSo normally at this point, you would just open the preferred client and the Docker MCP gets connected automatically. But here we will execute a different command. Use the Docker terminal at the bottom of the app and enter this code:\n\n`docker mcp gateway run --transport sse`\n\nThis will use the sse instead of the default stdio transport and will also output the port at which the server is running in the terminal.\n\n    > Watching for configuration updates...\n    > Initialized in 3.6594564s\n    > Start sse server on port 8811\n\nSo this is the port on localhost that is running the MCP server.\n\n**3. Expose the port with ngrok**\n\nThis is also another super simple step. Once your ngrok is setup (you can use the free account, it allows one domain exposed), run this in a new terminal window (cmd / powershell):\n\n`ngrok http 8811`\n\nThis will expose the port to the world wide web (sounds scary, but it's not - someone would have to randomly guess the entire web address generated by `ngrok` and the port as well. Kind of a stretch).\n\n[Your generated URL](https://preview.redd.it/xmoql3l2gouf1.jpg?width=1040&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53f64526c6f5e1b96f318a3d4579bf1a60526ec5)\n\n**4. Setup the connection in ChatGPT**\n\nSo now you have a web address that you can put into the ChatGPT connectors, like so:\n\n[I don't know why this image is so huge, I tried resizing it down ...](https://preview.redd.it/lr4iguxagouf1.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fcd0e9e7ceb7a57a71f6bc9479d0353f774170b)\n\n\\---\n\nYeah, so I'm sorry if this was obvious and everyone managed to connect the local MCP servers to ChatGPT, but maybe this will be useful to someone else, who was kind of lost and searching for a guide and couldn't find one. Good luck :)",

      "text": "Hello! \n\nBeen a reader in this sub for quite some time. I have started a part time job where I am tasked to create a dashboard. No specific software is being required by the client, but I have chosen Looker Studio because the client is using Google as their work environment (sheets + drive). I would love to keep the cost low, or in this case totally free for the client but it's kinda hard working with Looker (I say PBI has better features imo). I am new in this so I don't wanna overcharge the client with my services, thankfully they don't demand much or give a very strict deadline.\n\nI have done all my transforms in my own personal work Gmail using Drive + Sheets + Google Apps Script because all of the raw data are just csv files. My dashboard is working and setup as intended, but it's quite hard to do the \"queries\" I need for each visualization -- I just do a single sheet for each \"query\" because star schema and joins does not work for Looker? I feel like I can do this better, but I am stuck.\n\nHere are my current concerns:\n\n1. If the client asks for more, like automation and additional dashboard features, would you have any suggestions as to how I can properly scale my workflow? I have read about GCP's storage and Bigquery, tried the free trial and I setup it wrong as my credits was depleted in a few days?? I think it's quite costly and overkill for a data that is less than 50k rows according to ChatGPT. \n2. Per my title, how can I \"sell\" this project to the client? What I mean is if in case the client wants to end our contract, like if they are completely satisfied with my simple automation, how can I transfer the ownership to them if I am currently using my personal email?\n\n*PS. I am* ***not*** *a Data analyst by profession nor working in Tech. I am just a guy who likes to try stuff and thankfully I got the chance to work on a real project after doing random Youtube ETL and dashboard projects.

If you want to sell yourself as a consultant, make sure you have the experience to know what you're doing. Then all other questions (how to do it, how to scale, how much will it cost) solve themselves.\n\nIf you don't have the experience and you want to learn at the cost of the client, make sure to tell them upfront. Otherwise you're building something that won't fit their needs, and that won't be able to adapt to their future needs. Something like this wouldn't sell, even if it's free.\n\nI would recommend joining an established data team as an junior employee or consultant for 2 to 5 years, until you've mastered one niche in the field. You might need to pitch as a data analyst instead of a DE, because DE is typically not seen as a junior-level job.",

What I don't know is if they are common because business analytical requirements dictate it, or if I, as DE, will benefit from it.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of cost. Using Iceberg (what I would use) on S3 to achieve h.s. must increase costs: on what factor? what does the increase depend on?\n\nEdit 1h later: Thanks to all of you for taking the time to reply.\n\nEdit 1h later number 2: \n\n    Conclusions drawn:\n    \n    The a) absence of a clear answer to the question and the presence of b) b.1) references to data modeling, business requirements and other analytical concepts, plus b.2) an unreasonable amount (>0) of avoidable unkind comments to the question, made me c) form this thin layer of new knowledge:\n    \n    There is no reason to think about historical snapshots of data in an environment where it's not required by downstream analytics or business requirements. Storing historical data is not required to maintain data lake-like structures and the ETL pipelines that move data from source to dashboards.\n\n",

Storage costs are often trivially cheap now, especially if you’re utilizing cold storage/archiving etc. This can help you strike a good balance of maintaining historical data if you need it without creating snapshots even where it’s not necessary.",

Yeah it can get quite expensive depending on the frequency at which you're taking these snapshots and how many you keep at any given time.

So I created an **open-source project** that demonstrates **30+ AI Agentic Patterns**, each in a single, focused file.\n\nEach pattern covers a core concept like:\n\n* Prompt Chaining\n* Multi-Agent Coordination\n* Reflection & Self-Correction\n* Knowledge Retrieval\n* Workflow Orchestration\n* Exception Handling\n* Human-in-the-loop\n* And more advanced ones like Recursive Agents & Code Execution\n\n✅ Works with OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Fireworks AI, Mistral, and even **Ollama** for local runs.  \n✅ Each file is self-contained — perfect for learning or extending.  \n✅ Open for contributions, feedback, and improvements!\n\nYou can check the full list and examples in the README here:  \n🔗 [https://github.com/learnwithparam/ai-agents-pattern](https://github.com/learnwithparam/ai-agents-pattern)\n\nWould love your feedback — especially on:\n\n1. Missing patterns worth adding\n2. Ways to make it more beginner-friendly\n3. Real-world examples to expand\n\nLet’s make AI agent design patterns as clear and reusable as software design patterns once were.",

Short conversations will work nicely.\n\nKoboldCpp also allows using a Whisper STT model.

I'm guilty of the same thing—ignoring maintenance until something breaks.\n\n\n\nSome thoughts on positioning: The weather notification feature is interesting but feels tangential. Consider if that's core to the value prop or just a nice-to-have. Focus is your friend early on.\n\n\n\nThe maintenance recommendations based on make/mileage is the killer feature. That's genuinely useful. Have you thought about integrating actual service records? Like letting users log what was done and when, so you can track history and remind them specifically (\"Last oil change was 5K miles ago\")?\n\n\n\nFor monetization: Auto shops would pay to be featured in your \"find nearby shops\" results. That's B2B revenue without charging users. Or partner with shops for commission on bookings made through the app.\n\n\n\nDistribution angle: Post in car-specific subreddits like r/MechanicAdvice, r/Cartalk, r/AutoDetailing. Frame it as \"Built this for myself, curious if others struggle with the same thing.\" Car people love tools.\n\n\n\nIs this iOS/Android/both? And how are you sourcing the maintenance schedules—manual entry or pulling from a database?",

If there are areas you want to focus on, make that clear. You can even give it parameters such as the amount of time you want to study each day, etc. If you’re a novice, explain that it needs to teach you using language suited for a novice. \n\nAnd if you want, tell it to generate quizzes at regular intervals to ensure you understand the material. \n\nBy the way, you can use this approach to learn anything. Personally, I like to learn by reading, doing, and watching videos, so I make that clear. Then I get lesson plans that include those activities. \n\nOne of the real benefits of doing this: it gives you the opportunity and focus to use AI every day. That alone gives you a better understanding of the ways it can be used. \n\nGood luck!",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI launched [this tool](https://gojiberry.ai) in May, and we made around $24K in September.\n\nIt hasn’t all been smooth sailing, so I’ll share what worked, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently.\n\nQuick disclaimer: when I started this SaaS, I had zero audience in the niche I was targeting. However, I already had experience in SaaS, having built and sold one that reached 500K ARR pretty fast. So I knew how to handle a team, find a CTO cofounder, etc.\n\nIt’s definitely not easy. The first months mean no salary and constant reinvestment. Without experience and being solo, building a SaaS feels almost impossible.\n\nFor me, it’s a “second stage” business, something to do once you already have some money and security.\n\nToday we have over 200 customers and more than 18,000 monthly website visits. Here’s how we got there.\n\nWhat didn’t work: Twitter was a total flop, my account didn’t take off. SEO is super slow; we spent quite a bit on articles, but results take time. Paid influencer posts weren’t worth it yet. Reddit ads didn’t perform as expected. Cold calling also wasn’t worth the effort.\n\nWhat worked:\n\n\\-Reddit brings about 30% of our traffic. We post daily across subreddits, mixing value posts, resources, and updates. It drives a lot of volume, though conversion rates are moderate. (You probably saw us a lot on Reddit... yes... it works !)\n\nOver the last 28 days, Reddit brought me:\n\n📈 3,800,000 impressions  \nvs only  \n📉 300,000 on LinkedIn.\n\nWhy such a gap?  \nBecause on Reddit, you can:  \n\\- post in dozens of subreddits  \n\\- get reach without any posting history.\n\nOn LinkedIn, it’s much harder to take off if you’re starting from zero.\n\nSo purely in terms of visibility, Reddit wins by a lot.  \nBut hold on... the next part changes everything.\n\n🌍 Website traffic  \nDuring the same period, Reddit generated 10x more traffic than LinkedIn.  \n(30k visitors VS 3k visitors)\n\n13x more impressions → only 10x more visits.  \nSo LinkedIn’s click-through rate is higher.\n\nWhen we look at countries:  \nLinkedIn = mostly US, browser traffic  \nReddit = 50% India, and almost all mobile traffic\n\nThis is what happened :  \nLinkedIn brought me more clients then reddit by a few %...  \nThis means that :  \n\\- At equal traffic, LinkedIn converts 10x better than Reddit.\n\nEven more: LinkedIn leads have longer LTV  \nThey churn less, request fewer refunds, and stay more engaged.\n\nSo :  \n👉 Reddit is an amazing top-of-funnel channel, reach, visibility, awareness.  \n👉 LinkedIn is a conversion powerhouse, trust, intent, and quality.\n\nIf I only focused on LinkedIn, I’d miss out on huge visibility.  \nIf I only focused on Reddit, I’d lose business efficiency.\n\nYes, Reddit works, but it’s chaotic, time-consuming, and sometimes frustrating.  \nYou’ll post a lot, some subreddits will hate you, others will ban you 😅\n\n\\-Outreach is our top conversion source. We use our own tool, to find high-intent leads showing buying signals on LinkedIn, then reach out via LinkedIn and cold email. We send 3000 emails per day + as many LinkedIn invitations as we can.\n\nWe get 3-5x more replies by email and on LinkedIn with our own tool compared to when we used Apollo or Sales Indicator databases. Using your own tool is honestly the key to building a successful SaaS, you always know exactly what needs to be improved.\n\n\\-LinkedIn inbound works great too. We post daily, and while it brings less traffic than Reddit, the leads are much more qualified. We use 3 accounts to post content. Some days it can bring us 10 sales.\n\nOur magic formula is 3k emails sent per day + 1 LinkedIn post per day + 5 reddit posts per week.\n\n\\- Our affiliate program has also been strong. We offer 30% recurring commissions, and affiliates have already earned over $3K. The key to a successful affiliate program is paying your affiliates as much as possible and giving them a full resource pack so it’s easy for them to promote your tool including videos, banners, ready-to-post content, and more.\n\n\\-Free tools worked incredibly well too. We launched four and shared them on Reddit and LinkedIn, which brought consistent traffic and signups every day. It’s pretty crazy because we put very little effort into it, yet every day people sign up for trials thanks to these free tools.\n\n\\- One big shift was moving from sales-led to product-led growth. Back in May, I was doing around 10 calls a day. It worked but wasn’t scalable. Now people sign up automatically, even while I sleep, and we only take calls with larger teams. It completely changed my life.\n\nWe’re a team of three plus one VA, spending zero on ads. Our only paid channel is affiliate commissions.\n\nGoal for December: hit 1M ARR.\n\nIf you have any questions, I’m happy to share more details and help anyone building their own SaaS.\n\nCheers !\n\n[Proof](https://gojiberry.ai/proof)",

It demands both practical experience and continuous technical and strategic learning.\n\nI’ve chosen the Security Architect / Security Engineer track as my main path toward that goal.\nAt university, I’ve specialized in Data Transmission and Informatics during my final year.\n\nMy plan is to start working in IT or Helpdesk first to gain real-world experience while simultaneously taking online courses to strengthen my knowledge base. I’ve already created a detailed roadmap — and I keep refining it to be even more accurate, including which certifications I’ll take during my first years of work.\n\nI’m not thinking just 1–2 years ahead — I’m thinking 10+ years into the future.\nIt will take time, discipline, and constant learning, but I believe it’s worth every step.\n\nTo those who have reached high-level roles in cybersecurity — especially CISOs, Security Directors, and Architects:\nWhat would you advise someone who’s at the beginning of this journey?\nWhat are the most important lessons or mindset shifts you learned on your way up?\nAnd if you see any flaws or gaps in my plan, I’d really appreciate your feedback.\n\nThank you for reading — and for sharing your wisdom. 🙏",

Everyone's bookmarking the \"ultimate guide\" and the \"7 templates that changed my life\" and yet... they still can't get consistent outputs.\n\nHere's the thing nobody wants to admit: templates are training wheels. They show you what *worked* for someone else's specific use case, with their specific model, on their specific task. You're not learning prompt engineering by copy-pasting - you're doing cargo cult programming with extra steps.\n\nReal prompt engineering isn't about having the perfect template collection. It's about understanding *why* a prompt works. It's recognizing the gap between your output and your goal, then knowing which lever to pull. That takes domain expertise and iteration, not a Notion database full of markdown files.\n\nThe obsession with templates is just intellectual comfort food. It feels productive to save that \"advanced technique for 2025\" post, but if you can't explain why adding few-shot examples fixes your timestamp problem, you're just throwing spaghetti at the wall.\n\nWant to actually get better? Pick one task. Write a terrible first prompt. Then iterate 15 times until it works. Document *why* each change helped or didn't.\n\nOr keep hoarding templates. Your choice.",

Make sure the post highlights that it's actually important to understand why a prompt works and not just copy pasting a existing one without thinking about it\" \n\n\nAlso, your take of \"understanding why a prompt works\" is somehow strongly discussable because you can never know why this prompt exactly triggers this and that behavior/output of a model. Those things remain blackboxes on a detail level. So yeah you can argue that it is understanding of prompts but one could also argue that it is just iterating and experimenting with prompt varations and not true understanding in a classical sense. Actual understanding like I can understand a term in a mathematical equation or understanding a language it isn't.",

          "text": "This sounds like an exciting project! It’s great to see open-source efforts aimed at scaling autonomous agents. Given your focus on provisioning and isolation, I’d recommend considering a few architectural aspects that could enhance your setup.\n\nFirst off, if you're looking for rapid VM startup times, you might want to explore using Firecracker microVMs. They can spin up in sub-second times, which is a game-changer when you need to deploy and tear down VMs quickly for your agents. This could significantly reduce the overhead when provisioning those 100 VMs you mentioned.\n\nFor isolation, hardware-level sandboxing is crucial, especially when running multiple agents that might have conflicting resource needs or security concerns. Ensuring that each agent operates in its own isolated environment can prevent issues that arise from resource contention or security vulnerabilities. If you haven't already, implementing a robust sandboxing strategy will be key to maintaining reliability in production.\n\nAlso, since you’re working with multi-agent coordination, consider leveraging A2A protocols for seamless communication between agents. This can help in scaling your system horizontally and managing the complexity of interactions as you add more agents to the mix.\n\nIf you’re using frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPT, make sure your infrastructure supports their native integrations. This can simplify your development process and allow you to focus more on the agent logic rather than the underlying infrastructure.\n\nLastly, persistent file systems and full compute access can be a huge advantage for your agents, especially if they need to maintain state or access shared resources. This can help in scenarios where agents need to collaborate or share data without losing context.\n\nI’ve been working with a platform that handles these exact use cases, and it’s been a lifesaver for managing agent deployments at scale. Best of luck with your project!",

      "text": "I've been using MCP servers for a while now - 3rd party ones, verified enterprise releases, and personal custom-builds. At first, the tool count was relatively manageable, but over time, that tool count has been increasing steadily across my servers. This increase in tool count has led to an increase in tool-related context bloat upon initialization at the beginning of a session. This has become a pain point and I'm looking for solutions that I might've missed, glossed over, or poorly applied in my first pass testing them. \n\nMy main CLI has been Claude Code (typically with the Sonnet models). With few servers and tools, the system's (Claude Sonnet #) tool calls were intuitive and fluid, while also being manageable from the context side of things. I tried to rig up a fork of an MCP management solution on GitHub (metaMCP) and ended up making a ton of modifications to it. Some of those mods were: external database of mcp tools, two-layered discover + execute meta tools, RAG-based index of said tools and descriptions, MCP tool use analytics, etc.. This system has decreased the context that's loaded upon initialization and works decently when the system is directly instructed to use tools or heavily nudged towards them. However, in typical development, the system just doesn't seem to organically 'discover' the indexed tools and attempt to use them, at least not nearly as well as before.\n\nNow, I know at least one other solution is to setup workspaces and load MCP's based on those, effectively limiting the context initialization tax. Relatedly, setting up pre-tool-use hooks and [claude.md](http://claude.md) tips can help, but they introduce their own problems as well. I've tried altering the tool descriptions, providing ample example use cases, and generally beefing up their schemas for the sake of better use. My development systems have gotten sufficiently complex and there are enough MCP servers of interest to me in each session that I'd like to find a way to manage this context bloat better without sacrificing what I would call organic tool usage (limited nudging). \n\n  \nAny ideas? I could very well be missing something simple here - still learning.\n\nTLDR; \n\n\\- Using Claude Code with mix of lots of MCP servers\n\n\\- Issues with context bloat upon initializing so many tools at once\n\n\\- Attempted some solutions and scanned forums, but things haven't quite solve the problem yet\n\n\\- Looking for suggestions for things to try out\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nP.S.

General idea is, if the LLM says \"I need to fetch payment transactions from Stripe and push them to Redis. Which tools are available?\", the gateway should be able to return exactly 2 tools - \"stripe\\_\\_get\\_txn\\_history\" & \"redis\\_\\_put\\_kv\" (for example).",

The tool groups feature looks like a clean way to pre-define exposures and essentially 'split' MCP servers further. \n\nAlso, I think I've built that dynamic list feature that you're mentioning in my custom metaMCP fork. I find that there are still many moments where the LLM system will struggle to even consider discovering tools for a particular need. I could have very well built this in a sub-par way though! \n\nI wonder if there might be hang ups with your list-fetch when the task is sufficiently broad, vague, or complicated. Sort of running up against the wall of LLM planning abilities with that. However, if you guys solve this or get something working consistently, well, and without excessive nudging/instruction, I would love to give it a go!",

That means we'll have to reembed all of our documents again, bringing up the question if we should consider switching embedding providers as well.\n\nOpenAI's text-embedding-3-large have served us quite well although I'd imagine there's also still room for improvement. gemini-001 and qwen3 lead the MTEB benchmarks, but we had trouble in the past relying on MTEB alone as a reference.\n\nSo, I'd be really interested in insights from people who made the switch and what your experience has been so far. OpenAI's embeddings haven't been updated in almost 2 years and a lot has happened in the LLM space since then. It seems like the low risk decision to stick with whatever works, but it would be great to hear from people who found something better.",

When the commit runs out programs can no longer allocate more memory even if there is plenty of physical memory left unused. This is because the kernel doesn't know when or if those programs will need their virtually allocated space, and it has already made a promise that this memory is available.\n\nYou can often have commit be more than double of the actually used memory which means you're only using half of your memory before programs start to crash... And that's why you want a large pagefile even if you never actually need to page any of the memory.\n\nI would recommend \"System Informer\" as a great program to track resource usage but you can also do it in the normal task manager, here's a screenshot of what to look for: [https://imgur.com/a/itn9ezD](https://imgur.com/a/itn9ezD)",

This will cause faster degradation of SSD drives, as you'll be writing the memory data to the SSD. This is primarily why page files are somewhat deprecated on new hardware; plus, RAM is substantially cheaper now and we just get piles of it. \n\n2. It is pretty slow. Historically, magnetic HDDs capped out at around 100 megabyte/s, which was about a quarter of the speed of memory and random access latency was a bitch, so page file memory was avoided where possible. SSDs are faster, but still substantially slower than real memory, and have the problem that they will degrade when used heavily for paged memory.",

          "text": "The answer to this changes every month as new LLMs get released or updated.  I suggest finding an online LLM leaderboard specific to your task type.  [One of my favorites](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard).   LLMs good at coding also tend to be good at reasoning.  Make sure to use a reasoning model (e.g. OpenAI's GPT-4o is not a reasoning model, but o4 is.)\n\nIf you are having trouble with all types of RAG, consider you are doing something wrong.  Perhaps your expectations are unrealistic, or you are using the wrong type of RAG, or you shouldn't be using RAG at all.\n\nRealize that LLMs are not logic engines.  All they do is statistically guess the next best word after a sequence of text.  They happen to be useful for some basic logic, but that's a side effect and somewhat of an illusion.  I suggest using an LLM with tools support to externally do math, theorem proving (e.g. Coq), code execution, or whatever.\n\nI've found LLMs are better if you provide a small guide for them to follow, even if the guide was generated by AI.   For example, I am learning German and I supplied an LLM with a guide of common German grammar rules, so that it would do a better job at explaining the grammar of example sentences I fed it.",

I used several methods to find appropriate documents from the retrieved docs  \n-keyword based matching BM 25,\n -Dense Retriever based on cosine similarity based top 3 documents\n- In the next alternative I employed LLM as document grader, if the document is insufficient, then LLM decides to generate query about missing element then collect adding evidence \n- Then I am feeding those evidences to three different fact-checkers persona, optimistic, critical, analytics \n- Then there are two agents synthesizer and finalizer who made ultimately decisions about the verification \nWhether the claim is TRUE, MOSTLY TRUE,HALF TRUE, FALSE OR MOSTLY FALSE\n- My dataset is based on fact-checking website where they have clear definitions of each label\n- It seems LLM is not efficient with multiclass problems.\n\nAny insight?",

      "text": "Hey All,\n\nI'm a developer, and I just got the hang of **vibe coding**! It's been an amazing experiment.\n\nI managed to create this app in **playdatepal.net**—. I leveraged **Firebase Studio**(mostly because it was free, haha) to handle everything from the frontend, backend, authentication, email services to deployment.\n\nWhile it's not 100% complete and the core AI feature is still on the roadmap, I'm genuinely amazed at the speed. I was able to build out the whole thing so fast! There were definitely ups and downs, including a bit of \"fighting with the AI\".\n\nHere’s the two liner breakdown:\n\n* **The Good:** It completely takes away all that frustrating **boilerplate stuff**.\n* **The Bad:** If the AI gets stuck, you really need to step in and patiently guide it to make the corrections.\n\nWould appreciate some feedback and happy to any questions.\n\nI would say it took around one week the to build all the features.\n\n[https://github.com/quantbuff/playdatepal](https://github.com/quantbuff/playdatepal)\n\n[**http://playdatepal.net**](http://playdatepal.net/)\n\n**NOTE: I posted this from a new account but name was very bad lol so created another account.**",

          "text": "Here is my full experience, which seems to be general consensus or may be not \n\n  \nFor the past week, my main pair programmer has been an AI. Together, we built PlayDate Pal—an app for parents who are tired of the scheduling chaos that is a 10-year-old's social life.  \n  \nEveryone calls it \"vibe coding.\" Just wanted to check out what am I missing.  \nThe Idea being, I will write 0 code and see how far can we go.  \n  \nI'd give it a vibe: \"Let's build a dashboard.\" It would generate the code. It was magical. For about 80% of the project, I felt like a wizard. The AI was like a junior dev with infinite energy, zero need for coffee, and a near instant turnaround time. Forms, components, database schemas... all done in minutes.  \n  \nThen we hit The Bug. A really nasty one.  \nThis is where \"vibe coding\" started to feel less like magic and more like arguing with a GPS that keeps telling you to \"turn left\" into a lake. The AI was great at generating potential fixes, but it lacked the gut feeling to find the root cause.  \nMy attempts to get it on track were met with a few classic AI moments:  \nThe \"I'm Sorry\" Loop: It would politely apologize for the error, promise to fix it, and then generate the exact same broken code.  \n  \nThe Symptom Fixer: It saw a leaky faucet and kept trying to patch it, not realizing the whole house was on fire because of a server configuration issue.  \nThis is where I had to step in. My role shifted from \"coder\" to \"AI manager.\" My job was to be the detective, the UX critic, and occasionally, the therapist telling the AI, \"It's okay, we'll get through this, now please stop generating the same broken code.\"  \n  \nConclusion: Vibe coding with an AI is a phenomenal accelerator. It makes the easy parts of development disappear. But it makes the hard parts—deep debugging, user empathy, and actual wisdom—more important than ever.  \nThe future isn't AI replacing developers. It's developers who are good at being the adult in the room for their AI partner. And I'm here for it.",

This kept my baseline stable.\n* **I Am the Feedback Loop:** Firebase Studio can jump the gun. To fix this, I made myself a mandatory step. I would copy the raw logs and feed them back to the AI myself.\n* **Strategy Before Execution:** This is the most important step. I specifically told the AI to \"strategize with me first after reading the logs\" and to only write code after I explicitly say so. This completely stopped its tendency to change code after every single command.\n\nThis is what worked for me 90% of the time. For other 10%\n\n* I would copy the relevant code snippet over to a separate, unconstrained Gemini chat (I found Gemini was somehow better at deep analysis than the Studio's integrated AI).\n* I asked Gemini for feedback, and then had it create precise instructions that I could paste back into Firebase Studio to tell it exactly what to do.\n* But this only works sometimes as Gemini does not have full context of application unless you use VSTudio + Gemini Plugin + context\n\nRemember Firebase Studio is free for creating 3 projects. Also at times it would just give up and stop changing code lol.\n\nI did not write even 1 line of code as that was my goal.",

Spin up Firebase Emulator Suite, write a seed script, and add integration tests (Vitest/Jest + Supertest) that hit your endpoints; unit test Firestore rules with the rules-unit-testing package. Add Sentry and structured logs early. For Cloud Functions, make handlers idempotent with a requestId, set timeouts/memory, use Cloud Tasks for retries, and rate-limit per user. Keep a [constraints.md](http://constraints.md) with domain terms, data shapes, and a never-do list; paste that into the AI each task, ask it for a plan, failure modes, and tests before code. Don’t mix client and admin SDKs, and move email to Postmark or Resend when you care about deliverability. I’ve run similar stacks with Supabase for auth and Vercel for hosting, and DreamFactory when I needed instant REST APIs over an existing SQL Server to power a Retool admin. Keep the speed, but make it safe with tests, logs, and tight prompts.",

      "text": "In summary, Mantium is a **cross-site manga tracker,** which means you can track manga from multiple sites (like MangaDex, MangaPlus, MangaHub, MangaUpdates, and others). Mantium doesn't download the chapter images, it downloads the manga metadata (name, URL, cover, etc.) and chapters metadata (number, name, URL) from the source sites to show in the Mantium dashboard or an iframe that you can add to your dashboard, like Homarr or Homepage. You also get notifications for new chapters of the manga you're tracking.\n\n* Please look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/diogovalentte/mantium) for a better explanation of Mantium features with screenshots.\n\n# Custom Manga Update\n\nCustom mangas are now more similar to regular mangas. They still aren't part of a multimanga, but they now have **more features**.\n\n**Last Released Chapter Selectors**\n\nThe ability to set last released chapter name and URL selectors for custom mangas was added, allowing more flexibility and customization when automatically tracking your manga and getting notifications.\n\nThese CSS or XPATH selectors will be used to fetch the custom manga last released chapter name and URL from the custom manga page. In the background job that runs periodically, custom manga configured with these selectors will have their last released chapter updated automatically. Notifications will also be sent if enabled in the configs.\n\n* More about it can be found [here](https://github.com/diogovalentte/mantium/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-manga).\n\n**Next Chapter replaced with Last Read Chapter**\n\nThe \"Next Chapter\" feature was removed and replaced with \"Last Read Chapter\". You can manually set the last read chapter and its URL. This will be used to track your reading progress.\n\n**Custom Manga Forms Updated**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v5f5831zyouf1.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b868e74b8de7b90cf79dae967e74a61cec9b7d3\n\n# Other changes\n\n* **added**: an update message that will be shown in the dashboard after a notable update with the update changes.\n* **removed**: ComicK source, as it was shut down.\n* **changed**: many of the API routes for manga. Check the docs if you use the API directly.",

      "text": "First off, I’m not talking about random apps, news, and social media. Those notifications are obviously a distraction.\n\nI’m talking about reminders we set for ourselves. You can have Apple reminders, for example, remind you on a day, at a time, even geofencing.\n\nIf you set a reminder to do something on a day at a time, there is a very high probability that the notification will pop up on your phone either a) when you are **in the middle of something** and can’t do anything about it or b) when you are **away from your devices** and don’t see it till later and have 27 new notifications. When you come back to that, stuff gets missed.\n\nWorse still, seeing a notification you can't act on right now, but know you shouldn't forget about, raises your stress level. *It's worse than useless, it's harmful.*\n\nThe whole idea of having your device give you time-sensitive reminders about stuff is backwards. It’s supposed to tap you on the shoulder to ***pull you out*** of what you’re doing. That only works sometimes.\n\nInstead, you should be ***pushing in*** to (checking) your todo list whenever you switch tasks. When you do that, the information in your todo list is in front of you only when you’re actually ready to do something with it.\n\nThere are exceptions of course. I sometimes set calendar reminders, particularly for really important things (calls, flights). When they’re surrounded by otherwise unscheduled time, I often add multiple reminders starting an hour or two before so that I’m expecting the reminder that actually tells me to stop what I’m doing. If it's that important and time sensitive, maybe an alarm is the right tool anyway. But the same principle applies to calendars too, especially if your days involve lots of scheduled activities (e.g. meetings). Instead of relying on reminders/notifications, check your calendar regularly throughout the day.\n\n**Push in** to your todo list/schedule, don’t wait to be pulled out by a notification.",

Job descriptions should focus on outcomes (\"launch our payment system,\" \"acquire first 100 customers\") not activities (\"write code,\" \"send emails\").\n\n\n\nScreen for people who've thrived in ambiguity before. Ask: \"Tell me about a time you built something without clear direction.\" If they can't answer, they'll struggle in early-stage chaos.\n\n\n\nOne thing I'd add to the \"never hire friends/family\" advice: the exception is if they're genuinely the best person AND you establish clear boundaries upfront. Written roles, regular check-ins, willingness to have hard conversations. But yeah, default to strangers.\n\n\n\nFor sourcing beyond your network: engage in communities where your ideal hires already are. Building fintech? Hang out in fintech Discord servers. Healthtech? Comment on healthcare founder posts. Your early hires should already care about your problem space.",

I made Invio because I wanted to make some invoices but all the open source selfhosted solutions I could personnaly find where too heavy for my use case, so I made my own.\n\nWhy Invio might be for you:\n\n* You dislike the feature bloat of alternatives\n* You want to get your invoices out there quickly\n* You prefer a modern tech stack\n\nAnd here is why Invio might NOT be for you:\n\n* You need more advanced features like CRM, project management\n* You have many employees\n\nHere are the biggest chances since the last post I made:\n\n* Switched to puppeteer for PDF rendering instead of wkhtmltopdf\n* Proper tax handling\n* XML exports\n* XML embedding in PDF\n* Darkmode\n* Custom invoice numbering patterns\n* Improved custom templates\n\nAbout the AI usage, I want to clarify this better then last time. AI was used during the development of this application, mostly to speed up the development proces, the app is however not vibe coded. Features are planned intentionally by me, code is sufficiently optimized (as far as I am concerned). I am open to have a discussion about ai usage in coding.\n\nRepo: [https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio](https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio)\n\nSite: [https://invio.dev/](https://invio.dev/)\n\nDocs: [https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio/wiki](https://github.com/kittendevv/Invio/wiki)",

It's entirely bootstrapped. 2 years in the making. \n\nMy first startup I got lucky, and very quickly. I built a CMS that would put together mobile app related marketing collateral together, put them in pre-defined templates, spin them off as iOS or Android apps blah blah. These were stupidly simple marketing apps that sales/biz-dev/marketing used. Nothing complex. \n\nI built the CMS after I met this guy who was running an agency of sorts serving the marketing/sales division of a Fortune 500. Met him by chance at a Best Buy 😂, texted him a few times, floated the idea to him a week after meeting him, showed him a POC in 2-3 weeks. It was a win-win situation. His agency could build apps quickly (like really, really quickly) and he could support his app-hungry clients. Long story short: We ended up selling the platform to the Fortune 500 that was his primary client within a year or so. \n\nMy current product was built for big law. I built it to put the meme chatbot wrapper Harvey in its place, which is the darling of the legal world right now 😂 oh I hate them so much. Pound-for-pound we are better than any other workflow automation platform serving the legal world. Here is my issue now: I have begun hating Big Law. I need to get out of bootstrap and take VC to even work with them. The entire culture is built to discourage innovation. But the good news is... What we have built is truly special in the context **intelligent** workflow automation (yes, I am biased). So we are exploring things outside of big law in earnest. It's expensive as heck this \"struggle\" but... Worth it :)",

          "text": ">so it’s a bit hard to figure out why we’re messing up here. Like is it because we don’t know our revenue plan? Is it because we haven’t built the product to completion? Or the fact that we don’t know who our traffic is and what they are willing to spend money on.\n\nIt could be all of these, or maybe none. But based on your questions, the short answer for where you are messing up in your thinking is that you just don’t know what you don’t know. And you’re wandering in the dark, guessworking, hoping something good happens soon. And it’s normal. The only question is what to do.\n\nIf simplify (it’s my understanding that works for me, maybe not for you), any founder works on finding answers to three questions: what value to create, how to deliver this value to the market, how to communicate this value.\n\nIn some sense, questions 1 and 3 are craft work from scratch, which is almost impossible to frame and describe properly, because each time is at least partly unique.\n\nOn the other hand, question 2, which refers to the value proposition (your offer, product or call it what you want) has a more engineering nature and always has an underlying logic. Understanding this logic (what you know) helps you build, experiment and refine in a more conscious style, not guessworking.\n\nIf simplify (again), the value proposition is an exchange process between you and the customer. This exchange has its own invariant parts and links between them with two dimensions: correctness and convergence. So your work here is to make your value proposition logically consistent and not contradictory, so your probability of winning the deal (selling to the customer) increases.\n\nSo first, try to understand the logic of your and your friends’ value props and what could be missing, so the deal between you and the customer can happen",

If you have an idea, I am open to hear it, I can work on CRM or Enterprises solutions too, if you have sales experience in it.\n\nif you can raise funds or do bootstrap with equity sharing that works too. I'm looking for someone with strong in marketing and sales and fundraising (I can't invest, running low on runway). Those who really want to make something passive. DM me to learn more about but can do 50/50 split no worries. Serious Non Technical Founders only please.",

      "text": "Hey guys, I’m **LetsGoNiko** on Twitch. I’ve been streaming occasionally, not particularly consistently or successfully lol, but this isn’t a plug for my Twitch channel.\n\nLast year, I lost my job as a Production Manager in the automotive industry after I sustained a serious lower back injury. I saw both a medical doctor and a chiropractor, got x-rays, and thankfully my spine, vertebra, and discs were all fine. But the muscles and ligaments from about the middle of my back all the way down to the bottom of my sacrum were completely wrecked and multiple compressions were putting pressure on my spine and the nerves running through it.\n\nFor months I was in constant, extreme pain. I couldn’t sit without extreme discomfort and standing wasn’t much better. I had violent muscle spasms all over my body, but especially in my calves while sitting, and I barely slept. Walking would trigger flashes of cold down my legs, like someone was splashing water on me. My doctor recommended I take medical leave under FMLA. When I told my company, my bosses seemed to take it personally and fired me before I could even file for it, despite the fact that I’ve never had a single issue at this employer. No performance issues. Never been late or called in sick. Never been reprimanded. No complaints from any employees. Made tons of improvements for the operations of the company even outside of my particular department. I was the go-to guy for literally everyone in the company. If anyone had a problem. They came to me or involved me in brainstorming the solution or planning around it. It was really strange that I was fired for needing to take medical leave which I was legally entitled to.\n\nSo I lived off my savings while I focused on recovery and physical therapy. Over a year later, I’m almost fully healed. There’s still a bit of pain and some minor muscle spasms, but it’s manageable. The job market though? It’s rough. Employers in my field are posting roles for less pay than before COVID, and even when I’ve landed interviews, I’ve lost out to someone else.\n\nSo in the meantime, I started working on other skills. Back in high school and college, I took a lot of programming classes so I’m familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, C++, and Python, but I don’t have a computer science degree or any professional experience. So, I figured maybe I can build a portfolio or even start my own business-kind-of-thing?\n\nWhile working on some small web apps for the beginnings of a portfolio, I was watching a lot of business videos on YouTube about people starting businesses anyone could do… but none of them felt right for me. Eventually I came across one video that sparked an idea and I thought, “I love video games. How can I take what I’m learning and build something around that?” That’s when I came up with **GigaGameGuides.com**.\n\nI’m not an expert in backend or SQL, but thanks to Supabase, YouTube tutorials, and a bit of help from AI tools, I managed to put together a working product.\n\nThere are already sites like Fextralife, IcyVeins, and GameFAQs, but I feel like the video game guide space is still under-served. Fextralife and IcyVeins mainly focus on the games their own teams play and guides made by their own team. They’re not community inclusive. GameFAQs has tons of community built content and a lot of useful guides especially for older games… but the site just feels dated. I still think I can provide something a bit different than the current market supports.\n\nI wanted to make something that felt modern and community-driven. Something that fixes the problems myself and others have had with guides: unclear directions, missing visuals, confusing layouts, and all that.\n\nYou might say, “I just use YouTube for guides,” and that’s fair. But video guides aren’t always the best for everything. Sometimes you just need a quick reference without scrubbing through a 10 or 20-minute video. Sometimes watching a video one time isn’t enough and you have to watch a particular section multiple times and scrolling back in the video gets annoying. Or you’re on console and using your phone to look at guides. Or you just prefer text guides with images or short clips. A lot of people do.\n\nSo here’s what I built:\n\n🎮 [**GigaGameGuides.com**](http://GigaGameGuides.com) \\- a platform where anyone can create, view, and share video game guides.\n\nIt has social aspects, a modular content builder and a free-form layout editor. Here's a quick demonstration of what it looks like to make a guide:\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o56275/video/ga5tofaa4suf1/player\n\nYou can:\n\n* Make and publish guides for any game\n* Create guide series (for walkthroughs, builds, etc.)\n* Connect your **Twitch account**, put a link on your stream to your gigagameguides profile and share guides with your viewers\n* Upvote and downvote guides and leave comments\n* Follow guide creators and see their work on your following page\n* Earn a creator score based on your guide ratings - badges and achievements to come in the future\n* See trending and featured guides\n\nYou can make any kind of guide:\n\n* A guide series where you show Lineups for **Sova on every map in Valorant**\n* Build guides or crafting guides for **Path of Exile 2**\n* Walkthroughs for **RPGs**\n* **Pokémon VGC** teambuilding tips\n* A guide to unlocking items, weapons, or characters in Megabonk\n* A guide to finding all collectibles or getting all achievements\n\nAnd if people appreciate your work, you can add a tip link, kinda like people do on nexusmods.\n\nAs for monetization, don’t worry. **99.999% of the value is completely free.**\n\nI’m not trying to be greedy. I just want to build something genuinely useful that people enjoy using. I figure if the value is good enough, then users might feel like it’s worth it to support the project financially.\n\nRight now, I’m using some free plans for hosting and database/storage but if the site ends up growing to a respectable sized community, it will start to cost money.\n\nThere’s an optional **$5/month** subscription through patreon that unlocks a few totally unnecessary “nice-to-haves” like:\n\n* Bookmarking guides\n* Viewing version history on updated guides\n* Supporter badge\n* an ad-free experience. The site is already set up for ad placement. I just have to wait on google adsense approval\n* VIP access to events - I would like to host events like tournaments and draft leagues and supporters would have priority access.\n\nThere’s an optional donation link for anyone who feels inclined to support the project directly.\n\nAnd if people really like the site, maybe I can make a merch store or something? Idk. A black T-shirt or hoodie with [GIGAGAMEGUIDES.COM](http://gigagameguides.com) on it in white font might go hard AF with that early internet energy.\n\nI am still thinking about more value I can add to the site. I have ideas for more features I can add to the site over time and will continue to work on it. My current task is improving the mobile experience. It’s making use of responsive design, but the mobile experience definitely has room for improvement. I think at some point I will make a mobile app. I plan to add a forum area as well, which I don’t think will take very long tbh. I just wanted to get a MVP (minimum viable product) ready and launched.\n\nAnyway, feel free to check it out if you’ve ever written guides or wanted to try. There aren’t any real guides yet, just a few placeholders I made for testing purposes and will delete as real guides start populating the site… but that’s where the community comes in.\n\nIf you want to make a guide for a game that’s not listed yet, leave a comment here or use the contact link at the bottom of the site and I’ll add it right away. I’ve added functionality so that I can add more games to the games list very easily and quickly. And if you have any ideas for more features, you can feel free to leave that here or on the contact link as well.\n\n👉[ **https://gigagameguides.com**](https://gigagameguides.com)\n\nIf the project is successful, then great. If not… Well at least I’ve created something cool for my portfolio.\n\nThanks for reading, and if you do check it out, I’d love to hear your feedback. 🙏",

I get generic, bland responses and when prompted to be more in-depth and specific it keeps giving me the same generic stuff, just like Pro Search.\n\nTried prompting the same stuff on LMArena and the difference is huge. \n\nHas anyone else noticed that?",

There's no way to ensure that, even with the exact same input, the router will choose the same background models. \n\nI think this currently happens for two main reasons:\n- OpenAI wants to use cheaper models/modes whenever possible, to save cycles for higher value (read: higher paying) customers. \n- They also get the benefit of A/B testing different model combinations to gather data on output quality and user satisfaction. \n\nIn the same way that Google rewrote titles and meta descriptions, and would change search ranking on the fly in order to test user satisfaction (and gather data), OpenAI now does this with their router (model selector). \n\nWe run into this all the time with AIappOnsite. We want personalized but still consistent output when site visitors use the apps, and some models are much more reliable than others. Good luck!",

Please report any hallucinations or errors.\n\n**Note**: This report does NOT include comments from the Usage Reports Megathread.\n\n---\n\n# 🧵 Report: What’s Actually Going On With Claude This Week (5–12 Oct 2025)\n\n>“This model’s not the same anymore” — you’ll see that line a lot below.\n\n# 🔍 Executive Summary\n\nOver the past week, r/ClaudeAI users are straight up spitting hot takes: **weekly usage caps** are suffocating workflows, the service is **unstable AF** (logouts, errors, lag), and **Claude Code 2.0 is glitching hard** (TAB=Thinking snafus, broken `/usage`, buggy Windows builds). GitHub confirms many of these fails in real life—issues filed, hot threads, rollback advice. Anthropic’s status page also logged “elevated errors” Oct 9, which syncs with the Reddit outage wave. Users are pissed, many are bouncing for refunds, but tucked in the mess are **workarounds** you can try *now*.\n\n# 🔍 Key Performance Observations (From Reddit Comments)\n\n(I’ve combed through all your pain points — nothing left behind.)\n\n# A. Availability / Login Hell\n\n* Mass **forced logouts / inability to sign back in** (notably around Oct 9).\n* Desktop/iOS apps *crash or quit mid-chat*.\n* Web UI sometimes complains “unexpected server error.”\n* Browser variability: Firefox sometimes works when Chrome dies.\n\n# B. Usage Limits & Context Cap Anxiety\n\n* Weekly caps way too tight: Max users reporting **30–90 % usage gone in hours**.\n* Single Opus replies burning huge chunks (e.g. 15 %).\n* Conversation lengths flagged “too long” with minimal input.\n* Confusion: Opus meter says 0 % yet Claude is blocked globally.\n\n# C. Speed / Timeouts / Freezes\n\n* Frequent timeouts, freezing mid-response, “Couldn’t connect.”\n* After a crash, sometimes refreshing shows the lost answer (but usage might already be spent).\n\n# D. Quality & Consistency Mess\n\n* Sonnet 4.5 is accused of being **sloppier, more generic, hallucinating**, ignoring instructions, and shifting mid-stream.\n* Memory/context: asking it to fetch project KB entries it already “knows” but it fails.\n* Code refactors going off the rails, contradictory edits, partial commit behavior.\n* Leakage of system warnings in user output (“token usage approaching 50 %”) showing internal prompts.\n\n# E. Refusals / Safety Persona / Therapy Mode\n\n* Long sessions sometimes trigger “Concern” or mental health nudges. Commenters see this as **derailing** or outright wrong.\n* Users explicitly say: “I did *not* ask you to psychoanalyze me.”\n\n# F. Model Differences / Feature Frustration\n\n* Some still praise Opus or early Sonnet 4.5 in narrow contexts.\n* But many say 4.5 fluctuates: “good moment” → “trash moment” in same session.\n\n# G. Artifact / UI / Input Problems\n\n* Artifact buttons vanish; inability to navigate prior versions in-chat.\n* Paid users sometimes can’t *create textual artifacts* (free accounts can).\n* Newline, bold/italic markdown shortcuts broken (Firefox/Ubuntu examples).\n* Chat UIs refuse newlines in some browsers.\n\n# H. Slack / Integration Issues\n\n* Claude Slack app missing, unreachable; Marketplace shows “error / unavailable.”\n* Users saw it disappear after announcement, with zero logs or updates.\n\n# I. Billing / Churn / Support\n\n* Multiple users canceling or demanding refunds.\n* Frustrated by usage caps effectively halving or quartering what they paid for.\n* Complaints about support silence / slow responses.\n\n# 📉 Overall User Sentiment (From the Thread)\n\n* **Heavily negative / frustrated**: the complaints far outnumber praise.\n* **Tone**: “gaslighting,” “lo-bot-omized,” “context anxiety,” “milking users.”\n* **Churn risk is real**: “Cancel my subscription,” “switch to GPT/Codex,” “refund me.”\n* **Silver linings?**: a few users say Sonnet still nails emotional scenes or code in some runs—but those are drowned in the noise.\n\n# 🛠 Possible Workarounds (Full list, no hold-backs)\n\n# 🚀 Quota / Token Burn / Thinking Mode Fixes\n\n* **Don’t leave Thinking / Extended mode ON** in v2; TAB toggles it—disable or remap.\n* Use minimal budgets for reasoning passes.\n* When possible, offload heavy tasks to **API with prompt-caching** to reduce consumption.\n\n# 🔄 Stability / Outage Mitigations\n\n* **Switch platforms / browsers** mid-session (Firefox > Chrome in many reports).\n* After “Couldn’t connect,” **refresh / reopen**—sometimes answer still appears.\n* Always check **Anthropic’s status page** during weirdness (Oct 9 incident lines up).\n\n# 📟 Claude Code v2 Workarounds (validated by GitHub)\n\n* **Pin / rollback** to earlier stable version (e.g. 2.0.1) and disable auto-updates (many users confirm this restores stability).\n* If `/usage` is broken, track usage via **Anthropic console** until CLI fixes land.\n* If `/feedback` errors, file issues directly or wait for patch.\n* On **Windows**, avoid native build if it's broken—use **npm install / WSL** version, pin version, disable updates.\n* If TAB breaks your shell/IDE, remap or use explicit commands instead.\n* For connectivity fails or 400/500 errors, start a fresh session; don’t insist “continue.”\n* If the native binary is 0-byte, reinstall pinned version only.\n* If Claude Code crashes when API is down, try buffered retries or switch to console/terminal fallback.\n\n# 📦 Artifact / UI / Input Hacks\n\n* Use the **Artifacts sidebar / “Your Artifacts” list** to surface missing versions—open it first, then jump into branch context.\n* If editing destroys artifacts, ask Claude to describe diffs and reapply manually.\n* If desktop app fails on HTML artifacts, open via **web UI**.\n* For markdown/newline failures: switch browsers or platforms temporarily (Ubuntu/Firefox combos reported fixes).\n\n# 🛠 Slack / Integration\n\n* Re-check Slack Marketplace after updates (it’s been intermittently removed).\n* If connector errors appear, roll back to integration instructions from Anthropic’s announcement.\n\n# 💸 Billing / Limits\n\n* File refund requests citing **“usage limits too tight”** (some users succeeded).\n* Use **Plan change / support escalation** to argue for more headroom.\n\n# 🔗 External Context & Explanations (Linked to Observations)\n\n* Anthropic’s **status page** logged **“elevated errors on Claude.ai”** Oct 9 (syncs with the login wave) and prior incidents (Oct 6, Oct 8).\n* **GitHub is lit** with issues about **Tab/Thinking toggle**, **/usage fail**, **500s**, **Windows binary bugs**, **performance degradation** (e.g. Issue #6976, “Severe performance degradation”)\n* A user-submitted issue titled **“Claude Code has degraded badly!”** tracks with reports of regression across sessions.\n* Past Anthropic postmortem says it *doesn’t intentionally degrade model quality*, but infrastructure bugs *have* degraded responses.\n* The rise of **weekly limits** was covered by tech media as an intentional throttle to reduce overload from heavy users.\n* Claude Code’s GitHub also tracks **IDE connectivity issues** (VSCode extension disconnects) in recent updates.\n* Issue #1101: Claude CLI sometimes crashes when API is down, losing queued prompts. That explains some “lost chat / midreply vanish” complaints. (\\[GitHub\\]\\[6\\])\n* Issue #1215: regression in honoring `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var—explains some weird model routing complaints.\n* Issue #7\\*\\*\\* (from older) logged “Claude Code extremely slow, hanging on simple commands” — baseline compatibility issue that may resurface.\n\n# 🚨 Emerging Issues (Reddit + GitHub combined)\n\n* **Safety/therapy nudges** in long sessions are more common this week.\n* **TAB mode / keystroke / UX breaking** in v2 is new and causing non-obvious token dumps.\n* **Windows native packaging collapse** (0-byte executables, memory bloat) has surfaced recently.\n* **Input / formatting regressions** in web UI (newline, bolding) perhaps under-reported in public repos.\n\n# ✅ Final “Don’t Sleep on These” Workarounds (You NEED to try)\n\n1. **Kill Thinking by default** in v2, remap TAB, use it only with intention.\n2. **Roll back / pin Claude Code version** if you’re on v2.0.x and suffering.\n3. **Use Console** as fallback when CLI `/usage` or `/feedback` fails.\n4. On Windows, prefer **npm + WSL** build over native installer until fixed.\n5. For missing artifacts, *sidebar first* → then jump.\n6. During outages: switch browsers/platforms, refresh, don’t panic.\n7. If Slack is missing: re-check Marketplace, retry when they finish updates.\n8. For refund/limit issues: escalate via support with quota evidence.",

Some of those tools might take a few seconds or even sometimes minutes to finish.\n\nBecause of the sequential behavior of models it just forces me to stop talking or cancels the tool call if I interrupt.\n\nDid anyone here have this problem? How did you handle it?\n\nI know pipecat has async tool calls done with some orchestration but I've tried this pattern and it's kinda working with gpt-5 but for any other model the replacement of tool result in the past just screws it up and it has no idea what just happened. Similarly with Claude. Gemini is the worst of them all.\n\nThanks!",

Add Zod schemas at the edge and log consent changes for GDPR (timestamp, purpose, version). In CI, block merges unless /wd:test hits coverage, Playwright smoke passes, and a Semgrep ruleset is clean; have /wd:cleanup run on feature branches to keep diffs tight.

      "text": "Hey guys, I am a mid level software engineer that works for a Fortune 500 company and I decided to create my own startup about 1.5 years ago on the side. I am very serious about my startup, but of course I still have my full time job, so I did not quit my job for the startup. I guess I can't tell you the exact application, but it is a forum/voice chat application that I truly believe in and there is not anything exactly like it out there. Most of the application is developed, with some additional features needing to be added. Keep in mind that I'm pre-revenue and haven't made even $1 from this startup.\n\nAnyway, I feel a little stuck. I've been bootstrapping and paying for everything out of pocket. Since I'm a software engineer, I started working on the code, but I hired additional developers that were better than me on Upwork and that has worked out. What I do is I get a 0% APR credit card for 18 months or so, and then I pay it off once the 0% APR is finished. I have approximately spent about $12,000 on my startup. I have created a pitchdeck (with help from a contractor on Upwork) and I even have a financial forecast spreadsheet.\n\nSo you all probably know by now what my problem is, yep, you guessed it, I need investors (just like most of you all probably). I am located in the east coast US and I've been sending nice and polite pitch request emails to venture capital firms all over the country, mostly prioritizing local VC's. I send about 5 different emails to different VC's every business/weekday. I have received two rejections so far, but no other replies back. I'm pretty sure so many startups send these emails, so my email gets buried. I use the \"contact us\" page as well as sending them direct emails.\n\nI have a nice healthy savings account, but I can't keep paying out of pocket. I really need an investor and I'm even open to giving away too much equity for anything reasonable. I don't know what to do as of now. Two investors were nice enough to let me call them and ask them questions, but they said that I was too early for them (and they probably weren't interested). What would you do if you were me right now ? I don't think I can go anywhere without investors. I tried applying to accelerators but I got rejected from them as well. I'm frustrated, but I knew it wasn't going to be easy, I've been trying to find investors for 3 months now. Any advice you all can give me ? What the hell do I do now ? I'm still going to have a few more development sprints that I will pay for, but I will have to pause operations after that. I'm stuck. Thanks for the replies !",

Launch to just them with a freemium model—free basic features, $10-20/month for premium (priority support, advanced moderation tools, custom branding, whatever solves real pain). Even 50 paying users gives you $500-1000 MRR, which is infinitely more attractive than zero revenue with ad dreams.\n\n\n\nFor distribution without marketing budget: find where your target users already hang out (Discord servers, subreddits, Facebook groups) and genuinely participate. Share what you're building when relevant. Host free events or AMAs using your own platform. Create a waitlist for features people actually want.\n\n\n\nThe chicken-and-egg problem you mentioned? Solve it by going narrow first. Better to have 100 engaged users in one niche than 10,000 ghost accounts. What specific community are you actually solving for?",

You're spending thousands on development while being pre-revenue, which puts you in the classic chicken-and-egg situation that kills most startups. VCs are saying you're \"too early\" because they need to see traction, not just a working product. Instead of burning through more credit cards on development sprints, pivot your strategy completely. Launch what you have as an MVP, even if it's missing features. Get real users, track engagement metrics, and start charging something - even $5/month proves people will pay. Build a waitlist for premium features. Document everything in terms of user growth, retention rates, and revenue trajectory. This data becomes your real pitch deck. When I was building OnePager, I learned that investors fund momentum way more than they fund potential. \n\nOnce you have actual usage data and some revenue coming in, the fundraising conversation completely changes from \"please believe in my idea\" to \"here's the growth we're seeing.\"",

But it wasn't too much of work until now that I decide to tackle it.\n\nI am thinking about \"consolidating\" it such that:\n- There is a single repo that serves as the \"deployment code\" for other repos\n- Other repos will connect and use the `.py` file in that template repo to deploy code\n\nIs this a viable approach? Additionally, if I check out two times to both repo, will the connection to the service originated from the child repo, or the template repo?\n\nAny other thought is appreciated.",

And I was sure that the previous caching time period was 1 hour, but I have no evidence to back it up.\n\nDoes anyone have any confirmation whether Claude cached a conversation for 60 minutes before the release of Sonnet 4.5? Or was it always 5 minutes? If it was 60 before, then the loss of long-term caching might explain why so many people are suddenly hitting their limits so fast, but if it was always 5 minutes then I'm barking up the wrong tree.",

I'm certain project files used to be cached for 1 hour as I used to have long project chats without hitting limits.\n\n\n## Methodology for testing.\n\nSet up: A 100k token PDF in knowledge. Ask a simple question about it.\n\nObservation: Session usage meter went up by 6%\n\nSend a Followup prompt immediately. Observe session meter increases by 1%. **Caching works!**\n\nTest: Wait more than five minutes and send another Followup prompt. \n\nObservation: Session meter increased by 6%! Confirming the PDF was **no longer cached!**.\n\nThis directly contradicts what Anthropic writes in their Claude usage best practices guide here: [Usage Limit Best Practices](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices)\n\nAnd I Quote:\n\n> Our system also includes caching that helps you optimize your limits:\n> - Content in projects is cached and doesn't count against your limits when reused.\n> - Similar prompts you use frequently are partially cached.\n\n\n## Conclusion and speculation\n\nProjects are **supposed** to save usage. So I conclude that recently Anthropic has reduced the cache TTL from 60 to 5 minutes on claude.ai and **this** is the primary cause of the recent spate of users complaining about reaching limits faster than before.",

I’m wondering if:\n\n* there’s any **online tool or web interface** that can run multiple benchmarks automatically (similar to Hugging Face’s Open LLM Leaderboard, but for local models), or\n* a more **user-friendly script or framework** that can test reasoning / logic / QA performance locally without too much setup.\n\nAny suggestions, tools, or workflows you’d recommend?  \nThanks in advance!",

For local testing, I'd actually recommend checking out OpenAI's evals framework even though it sounds counterintuitive - it works great with local models through API wrappers like vLLM or text-generation-webui's API mode. You can customize the cognitive tests way easier than with harness, and it handles multi-turn reasoning tasks much better.\n\nWhat I've been doing lately is building custom eval suites that actually matter for my use cases rather than chasing leaderboard scores. Generic benchmarks like MMLU don't really tell you if a model will be good at your specific reasoning tasks. At Anthromind we've found that creating domain-specific cognitive tests (even just 50-100 examples) gives you way better signal than running massive benchmark suites. For factual accuracy specifically, I'd suggest looking into retrieval-augmented evaluation setups where you can test how well models reason over provided context vs just hallucinating from training data.",

For a friendlier harness, try Hugging Face’s lighteval with vLLM or Ollama; it’s simpler than lm-evaluation-harness and handles GSM8K/BBH/SQuAD subsets out of the box. For multi-turn reasoning, run FastChat’s MT-Bench locally and judge with a stronger local model or a single remote pass. For factual accuracy in RAG, use Ragas and track faithfulness, context precision, and answer relevancy. Add a memory test: a simple needle-in-a-haystack doc plus multi-turn recall. Lock seeds, temperature/top\\_p, and do self-consistency (k=5) to reduce variance; normalize answers (regex, number equivalence) before scoring. For tracking, LangSmith or Weights & Biases give you run dashboards; DreamFactory has been handy for exposing ground-truth tables and eval prompts as quick APIs that my eval scripts can pull from alongside those tools.

Tips, app settings, or specific sync workflows that have worked for you are very welcome.  \nAny advice? ",

Are you running into challenges vetting suppliers in that region?\"\n\n\n\nTactical channels: LinkedIn is massive for Indian B2B. Post case studies of vendor issues (anonymized), cost savings achieved, compliance disasters avoided. Tag relevant manufacturers. Join manufacturing WhatsApp groups and Telegram channels—they exist for every vertical (textiles, electronics, auto parts). Provide value first.\n\n\n\nPartner with adjacent services: freight forwarders, quality inspection firms, trade finance companies. They talk to your ICPs daily and can refer you.\n\n\n\nDon't pitch fractional CPO upfront—manufacturers won't understand it. Pitch project-based: \"Let us vet your top 3 suppliers this quarter for ₹X.\" Land-and-expand.\n\n\n\nWhat specific manufacturing vertical are you targeting?

I'm not building the next Linux kernel, but I am willing to build a robust, well-maintained tool that solves a specific problem well.\n\nPlease describe your idea with as much detail as you can.

Classically, biomarkers are measurable indicators of the state of biological processes. Given the large number of molecules in modern datasets, a major challenge is identifying the best biomarkers for a particular setting. Here, we apply observability theory to establish a general methodology for biomarker selection. We demonstrate that observability identifies biologically meaningful sensors in a range of time series transcriptomics data. To address unique biological constraints, we introduce the method of dynamic sensor selection to maximize observability over time, thus enabling observability over regimes where system dynamics themselves are subject to change. Our observability-guided biomarker discovery framework extends to multiple data modalities, as demonstrated with the joint use of transcriptomics and chromosome conformation data. We demonstrate the generality of this approach by evaluating the observability of neural activity measured in movies and electroencephalograms. These applications highlight the broad utility of observability-guided biomarker selection, spanning agriculture, biomanufacturing, and neural systems.\"",

The money goes directly to charity.\n\nI wanted to share how I hit **50 waitlist signups in 7 days**, plus a peek at our analytics from Plausible (DM for requests)\n\n**Metrics (first week):**\n\n* 1.1K unique visitors\n* 1.7K pageviews\n* 81% bounce rate\n* 1m 43s average session time\n* Main traffic: Direct (friends + reddit), Paid Social (reddit + google)\n\n# What worked\n\n1. **Personal outreach first** – I messaged friends and small groups who care about self-improvement and asked for early feedback.\n2. **Build-in-public posts** – Shared small updates and screenshots on Reddit and X/Twitter. Transparency brings trust.\n3. **Exclusive early perks** – Added “Founders Role + incentives + discounted launch price locked in forever” for the first 50 users. People love being part of the “early crew.”\n4. **Email list** – Most people who join your waitlist will forget about you after a week unless you stay in touch.\n\nTech Stack:\n\n● Frontend: nextjs, logto auth, shadcn, cloudflare pages\n\n● Backend: asp dot net, neon db, upstash redis, clouldflare r2\n\n● Infra: digital ocean\n\n# What’s next\n\nIf you’re into habit tracking or behavior design, I’d love your feedback on the concept: 👉 [Lazytax](https://lazytax.club/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=lazytax_launch&utm_content=ad1&utm_term=launch12oct_r/startups)",

There's something surreal about strangers on the internet paying for something you built.\n\n**The real:** Keeping momentum has been way tougher than I expected. After that initial launch high wore off, it's been a grind. I found myself getting distracted, working on \"one more feature\" instead of actually getting it in front of people.\n\n**What's helping:** Finally accepted that marketing isn't optional. I spent so much time building the product but barely any time telling people about it. Now I'm forcing myself to dedicate actual time to marketing, whether it's writing posts, engaging in communities, actually talking about what I built. It feels uncomfortable but it's the only way forward.\n\nHope this helps if you're grinding on a side project. The building part is fun, but the marketing part is where the real work is.",

There is a boot order that you can setup on each LXC/ VM in the proxmox GUI. \n\nMake sure AdGuard is first and then put everything else second with a 60-120 second delayed \n\n-----------------------\n\nYou can then put wireguard (with wg-easy) on either device or both devices if you want redundancy. \n\nTypically people put the selfhosted VPN on there router because if the router is down then the Internet is out anyways.

Now I end up with a messy environment with multiple nodes but only one active, so I had to run the quorum command every time I lost power and the mini PC for Proxmox restarted. Also some issues with the storage that I had to run multiple commands on every reboot so that the VMs and containers would start. I don't have time and/or too lazy to start over for a clean state. That's why I wanted to have something simple for the funcs I need now.\n\nI guess I can run Adguard and Wireguard on containers either directly on QNAP or on Proxmox (preferably on QNAP as the NAS is running 24/7 anyway). I guess my main problem is the networking in and our containers with my local network. During my tests, some times I can VPN home for Adguard/Pi-Hole but don't have access to the NAS. Sometimes the other way around. Any hints? Maybe I've been overthinking the structure and missed the basic?",

This is why people run docker inside proxmox VM, so it's easier to migrate away from it if it doesn't fit there need anymore. \n\nEventually you will have to do a clean slate. I guess mini PC is a solution but it's a bandaid solution. (As you are aware)\n\n>During my tests, some times I can VPN home for Adguard/Pi-Hole but don't have access to the NAS. Sometimes the other way around. Any hints?\n\nWhat troubleshoot have you done? \n\nThis sounds like a firewall issue. Do you have any special networking in place? Any firewalls? etc?\n\n>Maybe I've been overthinking the structure and missed the basic?\n\nIt sounds like you have. As mentioned, you can buy new hardware if you want but this is a bandaid solution. It's best to troubleshoot your network to figure out what going on (maybe wire shark if needed) and re do your proxmox setup. \n\nHope that helps",

      "text": "over the past few months, i’ve been exploring how different ai chatbot platforms integrate large language models with knowledge retrieval and business logic automation.\n\nwhile ai chatbots often get grouped under one umbrella, the actual architectures vary a lot — from pure generative systems to hybrid models that mix retrieval-augmented generation (rag), fine-tuning, and symbolic reasoning.\n\nhere’s a quick overview of five approaches i’ve seen being used in production:\n\n1. sensay.io – focuses on knowledge-based, rag-driven chatbots. it connects files, sites, and videos into one context layer and prioritizes grounding in real data instead of general text generation. mainly used for customer support and enterprise knowledge management.\n\n2. intercom fin – combines gpt-style reasoning with crm and customer context. it’s optimized for support automation with human fallback when needed. best for large-scale customer interaction systems.\n\n3. drift – a mix of generative ai and rule-based marketing. it handles real-time lead qualification and conversational sales, automating the funnel while keeping things natural.\n\n4. landbot – a more structured, logic-first chatbot builder with optional ai features. great for predictable workflows like onboarding or faq automation.\n\n5. botpress – open-source and developer-friendly. supports custom llm integrations, embeddings, and apis, making it perfect for researchers or engineers testing multi-agent systems or fine-tuned models.\n\nfrom what i’ve seen, rag-based systems are becoming the standard for business chatbots because they can stay grounded in domain-specific data. fine-tuning still has its place but isn’t ideal for constantly changing information. and hybrid reasoning systems that mix symbolic logic with llms are starting to make a comeback — offering more control, transparency, and reasoning depth.\n\nai chatbots are clearly moving beyond basic q&a. the next big leap isn’t about how fluent they sound, but how efficiently they can retrieve, reason, and adapt across different contexts.\n\ni’m curious how others here see the trade-offs between:\n\n* rag and embeddings for accuracy\n* fine-tuned llms for consistency and tone\n* symbolic + neural hybrids for deeper reasoning\n\nwhere do you think enterprise ai assistants are heading in the next couple of years?\n\n",

Trying to keep up with everything at a detailed enough level to do technical work with it is just insanity. The field moves quickly enough that you’d need to plug your brain straight into several news feeds 24/7. You need to choose your battles instead, only really drill into what you care about and are really interested in, and gloss over the rest. I am currently not in a role where I’m specializing in anything, so I try to keep up with the broad strokes of as much as I can instead. But even that takes a pretty large chunk of my day. And then there is the issue of literacy in security, where the more experienced you are the better you are at keeping up BUT only if you’ve done so consistently up to that point. Take a long enough break and all that experience starts to mean less and less over time. \n\nAnd that is just about pure knowledge, keeping skills and knowhow updated requires even more work so they require even more specialization to not have you go mad. I am myself just trying to keep up with the best practices of deployments I make but lord knows that is not always the case. So it’s is just a sisyphusian undertaking, and you have to imagine Sisyphus smiling.

Change password reset options if they are not what you want so they can't get access to them (and start with your core email to make sure that is secure if it's your reset option). If you want to be super paranoid make sure there's no email forwarding turned on. Do the same with your phone and phone forwarding.\n\nThere's no special trick or hackerman gadget that will help you reclaim things. You just have to go reclaim them and lock them out. From a device you know is clean if you have doubts there.",

      "text": "Hello Everyone,\n\nHad a brief look and could not find the right sub, please let me know if you know where else I can post?  \n  \n I am a mid-term user of ChatGPT Pro and have been happy with it.  I do need to get better at prompting but in general I find it really helpful.\n\nWhat have I used it for?  \n1. Basic Tasks  \nI have used it to do some basic everyday tasks, rewriting some comms. Tidy up some data here and there and even some formula creation and validation.  I have used it to give me a starter in some document structure and even to help me think about things I might be missing.  \n2. Intermediate Tasks  \nI have requested some deeper research (city data, crime stats, population etc.) and even some code generation (not big parts but bits of powershell here and there, even some stuff for arduino and also [VB.NET](http://VB.NET) (dont judge)).  I have enough knowledge to know what I am using and any concern about what the results are asking me to do.  I watch for hallucinations and errors, and I don't expect that what comes back is accurate or perfect.  I use it as a tool to assist with my tasks, not to do the whole thing.  I ask for citations or references where things are critical e.g. references to a local city planning site with up to date information.  \n3. Advanced Tasks  \nI'm not pushing too much here yet, but I am keen to.  I've used photo uploads to assist with technical troubleshooting (think car engine stuff) and resolution and even deal finding as a result (the mobile app is awesome - even chat to it while driving).  I dig into electrical issues and have to challenge the results at times to ensure I don't make things go BANG.  I have also started a little side electronics project (for myself not a sellable thing) where I am getting lists of parts, where to get them and the code to bring my idea together (all of which I understand but this makes my life quicker).\n\nAll this to ask what others think of all the other tools out there, I am thinking specifically of things like [Perplexity.ai](http://Perplexity.ai) which gives you access to other models but I am not sure - I had a little play with it but not enough to know if I move to that or stay with ChatGPT Pro.  \n  \nI have played a little with Claude and Gemini so would be keen to hear what others think?  I'm not asking for a deep dive article into all the tools out there (it's a growing mine field) but where others have gone from Pro to [perplexity.ai](http://perplexity.ai) (as an example) and if they have had any big change as a result? \n\n  \n",

Better than many...\n\nWhile Perplexity excels at sourcing (incl for current/recent events), I've personally found its conversational ability and creative writing less robust than Claude or OpenAI, which might be a trade-off for your 'basic tasks' use case.\n\nFor coding specifically, Claude is the go to but Codex is coming in hot. Gemini is becoming a reliable all around workhorse and specifically benefits from Google, which already scraped and indexed the internet before the AI boom. \n\nFact is, it's all changing so fast that you just need to keep experimenting and, most importantly, applying these solutions in real world use cases. \n\nIt became clear to me at the dawn of the vibe coding craze that theres a ton of tinkering going on. But 'last mile delivery' (AI being used by regular people and solving existing problems) was just not happening. \n\nMy problem then was that I needed a simple, AI-powered app type thing on a website. Everyone was going on about GPTs but I didn't want to send my site traffic to OpenAI. I just wanted to turn one-shot prompts into tools site visitors can use. \n\nSo, even tho I'm saying we need to keep up to speed on new developments, it doesn't mean we have to use every new function or feature they release. \n\nA simple tool that helps and gets used by many is usually better than a cutting edge, complex thing used by and appreciated by only a few. The same goes for your own usage. Keep it simple and useful.",

It does not scale. \n\nBut the pricing models are all like saas.\n\nThe expectations are all like saas. \n\nSo when you’re successful, you have 3 options. \n1) stop selling additional subs.  new people are SOL. In a fight for market share, they will never do this. \n2) let requests fail. “server overloaded” messages. “come back later”.  Get in line.  Make all requests take longer. They will also not do this. Even thought it’s not the same, this is internet lingo for “this service is broken”. \n3) lower limits on subs, and lower compute on the backend.  rationing.

      "text": "Hello I have been at this for many hours. My goal is to finetune llama-3.1-8b with my own data using lora. I have tried unsloth's google colab and well it works in there.\n\nThe inference in the google colab is exactly what I'm looking. However, I cannot after many hours convert it to any kind of gguf or model that works on llama.cpp.\n\nI used unsloth's built in llama.cpp gguf convertor. I downloaded it and tried it. Maybe I just need to change the way llama-cli/server handles the prompt. This is because inferencing this gguf in the llama-server gui results in a sometimes infinite generation of garbage like:\n\n`hello, how can i help you?`  \n`<|im_start|>user`  \n`can you help me with a project?`  \n`<|im_start|>assistant`  \n`yes, i can assist you with any type of project!`  \n`<|im_start|>`\n\nThis often goes forever and sometimes doesn't even refer to the prompt.\n\nI have tried many other solutions. I downloaded the Lora adapter with the safetensors and tried to convert it in llama.cpp. There are errors like no \"config.json\" or \"tokenizer.model\". The lora model only has the following files:\n\n`adapter_model.safetensors gooch_data.jsonl tokenizer.json adapter_config.json config.json special_tokens_map.json tokenizer_config.json`\n\nNow there are a number of scripts in llama.cpp called llama-export-lora. or convert\\_lora\\_to\\_gguf.py. I have tried all of these with the above lora adapter and it always fails. sometimes due to the shape of some weights/tensors. Othertimes cause of missing files.\n\nI have seen the llama-finetune.exe but there seems little documentation on it.\n\nIm running a GTX 1080 TI so there are some limitations to what I can do locally.\n\nThis is a long message but I really don't know what to do. Any help I would appreciate very very much.\n\n\n\nEDIT:  \nI was able to solve this. It was all about the prompt template that was being injected by the server. I had to create a jinja file and pass it through llama-server or llama-cli.   \nI will leave this up in case anyone has similar issues. ",

Fresh Ubuntu 24.04 server, cuda 13 update 2, nightly build of pytorch for cuda 13,  580.95 driver.  I'm compiling vLLM specifically for sm120.  The cards show up running Nvidia-smi both in and out of the container, but vLLM doesn't see them when I try to load a model.  I do see some trace evidence in the logs of a reference to sm100 for some components.  Does anyone have a solid dockerfile or build process that has worked in a similar environment?

Buying another slow card isn't going to speed up the model, it will allow you to run bigger models that will be even slower than this. Waste of time and money (incl electricity costs) and you will end up regretting the purchase.\n\nTry testing it with \"write me a 1000 word story\" and then copy a paragraph or two from another story and ask it to continue based on what you copied.

Some of those tools might take a few seconds or even sometimes minutes to finish.\n\nBecause of the sequential behavior of models it just forces me to stop talking or cancels the tool call if I interrupt.\n\nDid anyone here have this problem? How did you handle it?\n\nI know pipecat has async tool calls done with some orchestration but I've tried this pattern and it's kinda working with gpt-5 but for any other model the replacement of tool result in the past just screws it up and it has no idea what just happened. Similarly with Claude. Gemini is the worst of them all.\n\nAre there any open source models you know able to handle it? Or do you know any patterns? Maybe I can fine tune a model to handle scenarios like this myself with unsloth?\n\nThanks!",

I feel like backend it generates is very good however, UI generation seems lack luster and very buggy and many a times it is not able to solve its own problems. I found lovable to generate a very good UI . However, if I can use claude code to improve UI generation I would really prefer that given that it already has context of the whole repo and code base and can better make full stack changes. Otherwise I spend too much time writing prompts for these two agents. \n\nTLDR; Anyone has any suggestions for me to improve UI generation with claude code ? Thanks",

Nothing crazy—just showing up, being visible, sharing our story. At first, it felt like... nothing was happening. The metrics that matter to most founders (conversions, signups, CAC) weren't moving much.\n\n\n\nThen something shifted.\n\n\n\nOur performance marketing costs started dropping. Like, noticeably. Customer acquisition got easier. People were coming in warmer, converting faster, trusting us quicker.\n\n\n\nHere's the thing most people miss: brand marketing and performance marketing need to be kept separate in your mind. They're not the same game.\n\n\n\nPerformance marketing = short-term, direct response, immediate ROI.\n\nBrand marketing = long-term, compounding, trust-building.\n\n\n\nBut here's the kicker: brand marketing automatically lowers your CAC over time. It's not immediate. It's not flashy. But it compounds.\n\n\n\nWhen people have seen your brand, heard your story, and trust you before they even click your ad... your performance marketing works way better. You're not starting from zero anymore.\n\n\n\nFor founders grinding away at performance marketing wondering why CAC keeps climbing—consider this: you might be fighting uphill because you skipped the brand work.\n\n\n\nIt's a long-term game. It requires patience. But the payoff is real.\n\n\n\nJust wanted to share this because I wish someone had told me this 2 years ago.",

Not making money, or finalizing a product. I make landing pages and get pointers from front end developers. Plus all of this can go into a portfolio. I can drop my github if you’d like to view. I started with lua, went to basic front end (HTML, JS, CSS), then started scaling from there. Of course you don’t have to follow any of this, I took a more game development approach to programming as a whole, but it’s tough to start at 15 with money, and the more you learn the better everything will come along.",

Also keep hearing “design is the moat”. Been chatting w/ founders during tech week and a lot of them say good design or frontend talent’s just hard to find.\n\nWant to ask from founders here:\n\n* how do you handle design / frontend right now (yourself, in-house, agency, freelancer)?\n* is this a pain, or you’ve got it covered?\n* have you worked with designers before? what worked / didn’t?\n* what matters most: product ui/ux, website, branding, marketing, front-end, smth else?\n* are you B2B, prosumer, B2C, or smth else?\n* stage or batch? (building, launched, scaling, later-stage, help me understand)\n\nContext:\n\nWas a YC founder, technical founder + led product & design. Our product got acquired, mostly because of the experience we built, we basically rebuilt the same thing inside the acquirer’s platform. Since then have worked with a few YC founders on design from rough ideas → real product experiences + websites.\n\nSo I’m trying to see if this is a real struggle for more people, and if it's just design or also frontend. I care about this stuff a lot and wanna understand how other founders are thinking about it. (Might host free consults if useful.)",

      "text": "Hi,\n\nI’m **Jasmeet Singh** (Linkedin: jasmeet-singh-22531348), I spent over 10 years as a Tech Lead at Google, where I built products used by billions. But honestly it was a really frustrating experience, with no real impact. So I decided to quit and build something real.\n\nWhat I didn’t realize then was just how many hard (and humbling) lessons were waiting for me on the other side.\n\nThis post is one of them, a story you might relate to if you’re building or dreaming of building something yourself. If you enjoy it, I’ll share more of these lessons in future posts.\n\nBefore I dive in, here’s a quick line about what I’m building now:\n\nDialogue does podcast reviews on books: short, engaging, conversation-style episodes that make it easier to learn from books, and even dive deeper into some concepts with external research and examples. It has helped me on my startup journey tremendously, something you might find interesting.\n\n**My first attempt at a startup Product**\n\nI spent seven months building what I thought was the perfect reading product.\n\nAn AI reader with every feature I could imagine: scene by scene summarization, character tracking, chat w/ characters, AI explanation of vague concepts, chapter summaries, instant audiobook conversion and more. I was convinced people would love it.\n\nWhen I finally shared it with friends and family I was hit with silence. Nobody cared. I had to force them to use it. \n\n\"Maybe my friends just aren't readers,\" I rationalized to myself. So I kept building: UI features, improvement to database architecture, network security layer and other BS features. Finally when I was sure this is as good as it gets, I launched.\n\nBut reality hit me hard because nobody used it. Even though it was free and powerful.\n\nWhen the first 1-star rating came in on the Play Store, it gave me a huge knot in my stomach.\n\nRealizing people don't want the product you've poured your heart into was brutal. But the **faster you accept it and move on, the better.**\n\nAfter shutting down the reader, I started fresh with Dialogue, an app that converts books into AI podcasts.\n\n**This time, things were different**\n\nWeek 1: Built an MVP. No overthinking, no feature overload. Just used NotebookLM to convert books into Podcasts and hosted them with AWS S3 and Lambda. Flutter app. Launch on Play store.\n\nWeek 2: Posted on Reddit, got my first downloads. The post was shared \\~50 times, several early adopters messaged me privately. \n\nWeek 3-4: Hit 100 users with encouraging feedback. That was my **initial product market fit**.\n\nNow: **89 Five-star reviews** across app stores, even though the app is still missing features.\n\nMy biggest advice is stop building in isolation for months.\n\nShip something small in a week. Get real feedback. Iterate.\n\nBuilding small and seeing happy customers along the way is infinitely better than spending months perfecting a product nobody wants.\n\nThe hardest part of startups isn't the long hours or the technical challenges; it's **accepting that your brilliant idea might be wrong**, and being willing to pivot before you've wasted months proving it.\n\n**Btw Dialogue is free,** and has the following Startup/Founder books so far (among 46 other books)\n\n* Zero to One\n* Lost & Founder\n* Lean Startup\n* The Startup Playbook\n* Click\n\nMore are coming, and I’m **accepting recommendations in the comments** of this post.\n\nCheers\n\n  \n",

I keep wondering if it’s better to be upfront or kinda low-key when sharing early builds. personally, I’ve found that jumping into threads where people are already asking about startup tools or advice is way more effective - those high-intent conversations convert better, especially if your reply is genuinely helpful.\n\n\n\nI actually built a tool (called CueReply) for exactly this purpose - it surfaces the right threads on Reddit and even helps you draft replies that add value, rather than come off as pushy. I’m running a closed beta for it right now; feedback’s been surprisingly positive from indie founders trying to grow on Reddit. If you’re open to experimenting, happy to share more about it.\n\n\n\nalso def gonna check out the Zero to One episode. any plans for more niche tech books? stuff like Inspired by Marty Cagan or maybe even technical team memoirs?",

Confidentiality is a must in our sector, so we want to go full local.\nSo far I’ve been building it myself with Ollama, and it works of course but the performance is low to mid at best. \n\nI’ve looked online and saw RAGflow, which proposes a pre-built solution to this problem. I haven’t tried it yet, and I will very soon, but beforehand I needed to understand if it’s compatible with my confidentiality needs. \nI saw you can run it with Ollama, but I just wanted to make sure that there is no intermediate step in the data flow where data exists the premise. Does anyone have experience with this? \n\nAre there any other options for that?",

I see lots of posts from people in this sub using it and they seem to be quite successful. \n\nSecondly if it is recommended to go to comfyui I’m wondering where people usually get their workflows from ? \n\nI’ve looked into comfyui manager and it looks to be a necessity at this stage for a newbie like me if I was to get into comfyui. \n\nAny help on all of this would be greatly appreciated   \n\nI’m currently using a 7800x3D, a 4090 and I only have 32GB DDR5 6000mhz ram. \n\nUsing the preset took my animation time making down from 38 minutes to 8 minutes using the presets and I’d love to be able to carry on using them. \n\nI’m using the 14B 2.2 I2V model",

The model just falls apart too easily. Training distilled models sucks, and Flux'x text encoder isn't great. I've moved on to Qwen Image.\n\nI recommend using ai-toolkit as a starting point. I have done most of my training with SimpleTuner, but understanding the data loader is a bear and it's easier to make mistakes with it. It does support a fairly unique student/teacher regularization approach that I found extremely effective for longer more complex training runs, that's the main reason I still use it.\n\nAnyways, I posted this yesterday about Qwen and photorealism training, it's worth a read--\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1o22hby/comment/nj1arn2/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/comfyui/comments/1o22hby/comment/nj1arn2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

See the previous period's performance and workarounds report here [https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/wiki/latestworkaroundreport)\n\nIt will also free up space on the main feed to make more visible the interesting insights and constructions of those using Claude productively.\n\n**What Can I Post on this Megathread?**\n\nUse this thread to voice all your experiences (positive and negative) as well as observations regarding the current performance of Claude. This includes any discussion, questions, experiences and speculations of quota, limits, context window size, downtime, price, subscription issues, general gripes, why you are quitting, Anthropic's motives, and comparative performance with other competitors.\n\n**So What are the Rules For Contributing Here?**\n\nAll the same as for the main feed (especially keep the discussion on the technology)\n\n* Give evidence of your performance issues and experiences wherever relevant. Include prompts and responses, platform you used, time it occurred. In other words, be helpful to others.\n* The AI performance analysis will ignore comments that don't appear credible to it or are too vague.\n* All other subreddit rules apply.\n\n**Do I Have to Post All Performance Issues Here and Not in the Main Feed?**\n\n**Yes.** This helps us track performance issues, workarounds and sentiment and keeps the feed free from event-related post floods.",

Using Sonnet 4.5. and I'm getting a \"Hold on generating\" response, where it just keeps telling me it's taking a moment to think before responding. 45+ seconds later it starts spitting out a response in the chat instead of the artifact I asked for(an issue that seems to be ridiculously constant with 4.5). So I stop the response. That one prompt somehow ate up 7% of my 5 hour limit. And my limit KEEPS jumping up in random 4-7% increments. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to any of this. I'm hoping Anthropic starts paying attention and actually giving a shit about it's customers. But I don't have high hopes. It's becoming a useless service to pay for.\n\nEdit: Every prompt is \"Taking a moment. Ruminating. Hold on.\" And then taking forever to respond. I checked my usage and it suddenly jumped up 20%.

A mac is (way) less power hungry than a PC, but also consumes more than the Coral. Also you need to think idle vs max vs actual. Maybe a 5090 with a power limit consumes 450W while an M1 consumes 65W during inference, but if one takes 10x less time than the other, the power consumption calculation changes.\n\nSince you mention euros, are you in a country with expensive electricity? How much? What's your usage going to be like? Do you need the machine to be up 24/7 or can you turn it off at night (or only turn it on when you use it)? Maybe idle power is more important than max consumption?",

Pin a Rulefile at repo root and link it in every chat.\n\n\n2. Set a file budget of three files per run. Enforce it.\n\n\n3. Require a staging gate. The agent must show diffs and wait.\n\n\n4. Forbid git commands by the model. Humans commit only.\n\n\n5. Scope edits to explicit paths. Name the exact files.\n\n\n6. Run a Janitor pass after apply. Delete temp files. Rename strays. Fix imports.\n\n\n7. Block new tests unless requested. No unchecked test files.\n\n\n8. Demand a Proof log each run: intent, touched files, diffs, rollback.\n\n\n9. Reuse the same Rulefile every session to prevent drift.\n\n\n10. If the agent ignores a rule, kill the session and reload.\n\n\n\nMinimal Rulefile text: • Only modify the three named files.\n• Do not create or delete files without explicit instruction.\n• Show a unified diff for each file and wait for approval.\n• Never run git, package managers, or shell commands.\n• After apply, run the Janitor pass and produce a Proof log.\n\nThis keeps sessions short, reversible, and safe.",

In just one day, Cursor charged me **over $210**, which is completely impossible based on their published token rates.\n\nWhen I contacted support, I received no proper explanation. If their pricing logic was accurate, every 785K-token session should cost roughly the same — not 10× more at random.\n\nThis isn’t a small billing glitch — it looks like **a systematic overcharge problem** that can silently drain your balance without reason.\n\n**I strongly recommend everyone to double-check your Cursor AI usage logs and invoices carefully.** Something is clearly wrong with how token costs are calculated.\n\nCursor AI team, please fix your billing logic and issue refunds to affected users.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnwlc3lviouf1.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=b07142f4efc33f5542e817f19ec3187de17b0da2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ur4rr75wiouf1.png?width=1377&format=png&auto=webp&s=860af98631bb2052fe9dbf52fab54b488fe111ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ci8bhtwiouf1.png?width=1286&format=png&auto=webp&s=660354c78b94436eb3d26a9e2689428b18c79464\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7w29viexiouf1.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d36204409a3afc3a44e5487e3bb5552651a194d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pdcapzxiouf1.png?width=1284&format=png&auto=webp&s=54bf5288f36b68b947fa821da638d4aeb394733d\n\n  \n",

I just want to know if emails are a problem people want to solve.\n\nIt seems that people in email-heavy industries (finance, legal, SMBs, consulting) get hundreds of emails a day, and actually processing them takes a significant amount of time. There are some things to make it faster (superhuman), but not much is easy to learn, customizable, and actually works well with AI.\n\nFrom what I've seen, here's what matters most:\n\n* Drafting: Having an AI write and actually sound like you. You can tell it what you want to say in a few words, and it'll actually do it.\n* Agentic Handling: In natural language, you should be able to tell your inbox what to do with certain emails, and it should just do it. (example: \"forward all service requests to this service person\")\n* Labeling/Summarizing & Prioritization: Reliably knowing what an email is about and how urgent it is before opening it and reading it\n* Voice Control: Saying things out loud and it just happening. (Ex: \"Reply scheduling a meeting,\" \"Forward this to Jack,\" \"Remind me about this tomorrow,\" \"Archive this\")\n\n**1. Would you use this?**\n\n**2. In a magical email world, where you could do anything with your email, what would you want to see? What matters most?**\n\n**3. What would make you switch from GMail (or whatever email client you're using) to this?**\n\nP.S. Some extra things I've thought about:\n\n* Privacy: local app so no emails are stored anywhere other than your laptop\n* No destructive actions: no automatically deleting or sending emails\n\n**I AM NOT SELLING ANYTHING! I haven't even built a product. Just trying to learn what people want.**\n\n# All types of feedback are appreciated!",

This is where most VCs and startup founders end up in. You need high conviction and sit on a \"secret\" and wait for the market to be ready.\n\nBad idea/Good market startups:\n\nMost hype cycles fall into this bucket..including the current AI hype cycle. Most AI ideas today are just bad ideas. But since the market is hot, you can equally succeed here. \n\nBesides testing and doing marketing, there's really no way for anyone to know which bucket your startup falls under. Investors all want to find startups that  fall into the \"Good idea/Good market\" bucket but those are super rare, Steve Jobs was one of the few people that seemed to know how to find them consistently.\n\n\n\n",

For outreach generally the bigger the company the better because you can sell them something more expensive. So it's easier to ROI on the tools and mostly the TIME spent on doing demo's etc\n\nStep 2: Choose channel   \nThis is based on step 1. Imo cold email is still king unless you want to target influencers or local businesses. Anything B2B which your product seems to be; go for cold email.\n\nStep 3: Write your copy  \nThe goal of the email is to get a response!! NOT TO SELL THE PRODUCT. Very important distinction. Very important to keep that in mind and write like that. You don't ask a girl to marry you on the first date. \n\nOr I always like the frame of a tradeshow. You wouldn't run up to someone and start pitching them right away. Rather you'd introduce the problem you solve for whom and ask if they recognize that issue at all? (or nah?)\n\nStep 4: technicals\n\nFor Cold email you really need to get the technicals right these days else it's just waste of time. You will end up in spam. So get instantly + their DFY domains and inboxes. 50% microsoft 50% google. For leads scraping sales nav is ideal but apollo is the lazy way\n\nThen start sending and don't stop. Recycle the same people after 60-days (unless they opted out of course) and keep going until it works\n\nBetween campaigns cycle big things like problem statement, offer and target role/company. Not mini copywriting things ; this isn't like ads!\n\nGood luck!",

This attracts similar users organically.\n* Identify the moment in your user journey where sharing value makes sense — and build a “loop” around that behavior.\n\nThis is what we’re applying at [**Glasp**](https://glasp.co/posts/6de5b27c-a703-4492-b728-64aae921d899) — a social knowledge platform that lets users save and share insights from articles and YouTube videos. Instead of direct ads or cold outreach, we grow through **user-shared highlights** that bring in like-minded learners and creators.\n\nOnce your outreach drives engagement that generates content, feedback, or visibility, you’ve created a mini flywheel — and that’s what compounds growth.",

          "text": "Traditional salespeople still have a role in SaaS, but only in specific conditions and quickly shrinking. They work well in relationship-dependent, high-ticket, complex deals like enterprise SaaS, products needing multi-stakeholder buy-in, or where reputation expedites sales. In these cases, trust matters more than scripts. Experienced reps with industry ties can open doors that younger sales teams can't. But for most SaaS, especially product-led growth or SMBs, traditional sales add friction, don't scale well, and are costly for deals under $10–15k. Many founders start with a traditional rep, then shift to systematized, data-driven sales or self-serve models as growth progresses. If hiring traditional reps now, structure carefully: pay for performance, provide enablement materials, and capture their insights for future sales. They serve as a bridge for initial clients but shouldn’t be the core of your sales system.",

This marketing firm is updating our website, they are recommending we add a page showing several team members and to come up with some names. They say showing a large team is more appealing to the potential customer, that people will trust us more if we are have a large team. \n\nWhat they say makes sense to me but I’m wondering how I can come up with more team members? How do small businesses do it? Do they show fake team members? Or simply skip this until their team is larger? I obviously really want this outbound campaign to work but I don’t know if faking things is the right thing to do either?\n",

      "text": "So, to start things off I'm relatively new to DevOps and GitOps. I'm trying to initialize an argoCD cluster using the declarative approach. As you know, argoCD has a application spec repository whose credentials it needs to bootstrap because that's where the config files are. After reading the docs I found out the external secrets operator server needs to run HTTPS (and it recommends cert-manager for this). So, I'm trying to initialze the cluster with argoCD configs, sealed secrets and an ESO to get the secrets BUT the ESO needs https which again is cert-manager. So, other than manually installing the cert-manager outside of argo and setting it up that way how would I do it? I'm also thinking just putting secrets in a sealed secret without an ESO to bootstrap argo first and then install everything else. If I missed anything please let me know. ",

It’s not a habit tracker — it’s more like a “daily quest” system that gives you one small, meaningful or meaningless challenge every day. Right now this quests are basic and not personalised.\n\nMain idea on website is: every morning it automatically drops \"quest\" page which will be till 3pm user time and then you can access to dashboard  where you see your streak and history and mark your quest as completed. It's very simple system and somehow works on me. I built it because I struggle to stay active and social, and I wanted something that pushes me gently seek discomfort. But behind idea is real psychology explained in book.\n\nRight now, I’m looking for **people** to try out the early version and tell me what they think — honest feedback. It’s web-based, minimal, and takes just a few minutes a day.\n\nHere is link [onestep.ge](https://www.onestep.ge/login-beta) where you can sign in with google account takes a seconds to do it.

      "text": "I am not a coder, just trying to build small useful tools for recruiters using AI\n\nHey folks,\n\nI wanted to share a side project I have been working with called Naukri* Boolean Builder.\n\nIf you are from Recruiting and India - you know how frustrating it can be to write Boolean strings for searching candidates in Naukri. \n\nOne missing quote and the whole thing stops working. So I made a simple tool that helps recruiters generate clean, optimized Boolean strings for Naukri.com.\n\n(*Naukri is the biggest job board in India) \n\nIt started as a personal experiment. I have been in talent solutions since 20 years and my team spends hours writing these queries every week. I wanted to see if I could make the process faster with some no-code logic and a bit of AI help.\n\nThat’s what this tool does.\n\n🔗 Link > https://vishal-dembla.github.io/Boolean-Builder-for-Naukri/\n\nWhat it does - \n1) Builds Boolean strings for Naukri search\n2) Lets you combine role, skills, and location\n3) Works on both desktop and mobile\n4) Copy and paste output straight into Naukri\n\nWhy I built this - \nI see this problem every day with recruiters. Boolean writing is repetitive and easy to mess up. I wanted to try my hand at building small tools that make recruiter workflows simpler using AI.\n\nDisclaimer\nI’m not a coder. Just trying to figure out how AI can help build useful tools.\n\nTech\nHTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built it with AI guidance, kept it simple and fast.\n\nNext steps\n- Write a free course \n- Add presets for common job roles\n- Maybe a Chrome extension later\n\nWould love feedback, especially from anyone who from recruiting, has interest in HrTech or AI-aided side projects.",

      "text": "Hi everyone, I wanted to share a project I built to solve a problem I’ve been facing at work. It’s called **MeshVox.net**.\n\nI work in IT in a secure environment where most communication platforms are blocked and personal cell phones are not allowed unless they are work-related. I needed a private way to communicate with colleagues and friends without using any centralized services or paid tools. After testing several options and finding none that worked reliably, I decided to build one myself.\n\n**MeshVox** is a fully browser-based voice chat that runs peer-to-peer over WebRTC. There are no central servers, databases, or authentication systems. Once connected, the audio stream goes directly between peers without touching any external infrastructure.\n\nIt has no paywalls, no subscriptions, and no hidden costs. It’s completely free and built by a single developer. The goal was to create a lightweight, privacy-friendly communication tool that works even under strict network restrictions.\n\nIt’s designed for desktop browsers because mobile devices often restrict background audio and persistent peer connections, which can cause interruptions. Keeping it desktop-only makes it reliable and consistent in real use.\n\nMeshVox supports Push-to-Talk and always-on modes and works well for small to medium groups. For me and a few friends, it’s been a reliable way to stay connected during work while keeping things, as we like to say, *“in full stealth mode.”*\n\nIf you want to give it a try, visit [**MeshVox.net**](https://meshvox.net). I’d really appreciate feedback from the self-hosting and privacy community, especially around stability and network performance.",

It’ll work offline. You still need HTTPS for mic access; use a local cert (mkcert) or localhost.\n\n\\- Internet: host the static site anywhere (NGINX, S3, GitHub Pages), run your own signaling, and add STUN/TURN for NAT traversal. For coturn, open 3478/UDP+TCP and 5349/TLS; allow UDP 49152–65535. For strict corporate firewalls, enable TURN over TCP/TLS on 443. Browsers use ephemeral ports automatically-no manual port binding in the app.\n\n\\- TURN only relays when direct P2P fails, so bandwidth cost is usually low unless clients are behind symmetric NAT.\n\n\n\nI’ve used Twilio’s STUN/TURN for reliability, coturn when self-hosting, and DreamFactory to spin up a quick REST API for room lists/logging without building a backend from scratch.\n\n\n\nBottom line: the media is P2P; you host the page + signaling (+ TURN if needed), not a central relay by default.",

No, it does not use AI. You have to give the script manually.\n\nHere is the resultant carousel: [https://www.instagram.com/p/DPtdBZHjDmd/?img\\_index=1](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPtdBZHjDmd/?img_index=1)\n\nHow it works?\n\nWell, I made a full youtube tutorial if you are interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKyjkgluTCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKyjkgluTCA)\n\nHere is the flow:\n\n1. The form node accepts the text input, deletes the rows in google sheet (you will understand the reason once you work with the workflow ) and loops through each input\n\n2. It uses [apitemplate.io](http://apitemplate.io) to automate image generation with api and parameters with custom predesigned template\n\n3. The urls/links of hosted images will be stored in the google sheet as the loop iterates\n\n4. After the end of the loop, All the links will be retrieved from google sheet and a html email template will be generated showcasing all the images\n\n5. Human in the loop - Manual approval email will be sent in Gmail\n\n6. If approved, The carousel will be uploaded to Instagram using http requests of [Blotato](https://blotato.com/?ref=karne)\n\nIf you don't want to take a headache of designing Instagram posts every single time, maybe just build this flow once and enjoy.\n\nAn upvote helps :)\n\nAnd hey, you can check out the configuration and tutorial here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKyjkgluTCA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKyjkgluTCA)\n\nAnd you can get the n8n template here: [https://github.com/MrKarne/youtube/blob/main/Instagram-Carousel-N8N-Automation](https://github.com/MrKarne/youtube/blob/main/Instagram-Carousel-N8N-Automation)\n\nPeace.",

For example:\n\n* [free-background-remover.imagepeel.com](http://free-background-remover.imagepeel.com)\n* [cartoonizer.imagepeel.com](http://cartoonizer.imagepeel.com)\n* [image-upscaler.imagepeel.com](http://image-upscaler.imagepeel.com)\n\nEach could then be optimized around its specific use case, while the main domain acts as the hub linking to them.\n\nOh, and one small note: your brand name is “ImagPeel” but the URL says “imagepeel.com” - a mismatch that could confuse users or hurt credibility slightly.\n\nIf I landed on a page boldly titled “The Best Free Background Remover Tool”, I’d instantly get it - and might even bookmark it.

I’ve seen a lot of image AI tools struggle when the landing page is confusing or cluttered and users bounce quickly. Trust signals like “powered by X AI” and privacy policy links can really help conversion.\n\nOn the SEO side, launching a blog that targets image editing and AI use cases is a smart move - stuff like “remove backgrounds with X” or “AI for product shots.” You can use tools like ChatGPT, Jasper, or Frase to write focused articles and then link those posts back to the main tool page. Also, updating older posts and optimizing internal links over time makes a big difference for ranking and retaining traffic.\n\nI’ve actually been working on something that automates a lot of this - keyword planning, blog outlines, internal linking, and keeping your content fresh and updated (so posts don’t fade away). Would you be interested in trying a beta version of it if you’re looking to grow organic traffic without hiring more help?\n\nFor monetization, subscriptions usually perform better if you clearly show the value, but starting with a freemium tier lets people try before they commit. Donate buttons work if you go viral but aren’t great for steady growth, I’ve had similar results with my projects.",

      "text": "Most people hate networking because they're picturing the slimy, transactional version where you pretend to care about strangers so they'll help you later. That version is gross, and you're right to hate it. But that's not what effective networking actually is.\n\nWe built this \"networking without being gross\" prompt for everyone who avoids professional connection-building because the traditional approach makes their skin crawl.\n\n\n\n***\\*\\*Context:\\*\\* I hate networking because it feels slimy and transactional, but I know I need professional connections to advance my career and grow my business.***\n\n***\\*\\*Role:\\*\\* You're a relationship-building expert who teaches authentic networking that focuses on mutual value and genuine connection rather than manipulation.***\n\n***\\*\\*Instructions:\\*\\* Help me develop networking approaches that feel natural and authentic while still being effective for building professional relationships and opportunities.***\n\n***\\*\\*Specifics:\\*\\* Cover conversation starters, value creation, follow-up strategies, relationship maintenance, and how to ask for help without being pushy or entitled.***\n\n***\\*\\*Parameters:\\*\\* Create networking strategies that align with my values and personality while still achieving professional goals.***\n\n***\\*\\*Yielding:\\*\\* Use all your tools and full comprehension to get to the best answers. Ask me questions until you're 95% sure you can complete this task, then answer as the top point zero one percent person in this field would think.***\n\nThe framework teaches networking approaches that feel natural and authentic while still being effective.\n\nConversation starters from genuine curiosity, not rehearsed pitches. When you meet someone new, you're not calculating their usefulness. You're genuinely interested in what they're building and why it matters to them.\n\nThat mindset shift changes everything. People can tell when you're actually interested versus when you're extracting value.\n\nValue creation strategies help others before you ask for anything. What introductions can you make? What resources can you share? What problems can you help solve? Lead with value, not extraction.\n\nFollow-up strategies maintain real relationships instead of collecting contacts. Networking isn't accumulating LinkedIn connections you never talk to. It's building relationships you actually maintain over time.\n\nRelationship maintenance is where most people fail. They meet someone interesting, have a good conversation, then never follow up. Or they only reach out when they need something. Both approaches kill potential relationships.\n\nHow to ask for help without being pushy or entitled. You need to be able to make requests. But there's a massive difference between entitled demands and respectful asks that acknowledge the other person's autonomy.\n\nCreating mutual value instead of one-sided extraction. The best professional relationships benefit both people. You're not just taking. You're contributing. You're helping each other succeed.\n\nWhen you focus on genuine connection and mutual value, career advancement happens naturally. Not because you manipulated anyone. Because you built real relationships with people who want to help you succeed.\n\nStop networking like a transactional weirdo. Start building actual relationships with people doing work you genuinely find interesting.\n\nBrowse the library: [https://flux-form.com/promptfuel/](https://flux-form.com/promptfuel/)\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/company/flux-form/](https://www.linkedin.com/company/flux-form/)\n\nWatch the breakdown: [https://youtu.be/obAQ-y5twrM](https://youtu.be/obAQ-y5twrM) ",

Fixing little parts of code, generating snippets, answering easy questions.

      "text": "(Sonnet 4.5, Pro, web)\nSo I hit the chat length wall on one of my chats today, and the artifact wasn't quite finished.   Just a text document, nothing too tricksy.\n\nSo I started a new chat and asked it to bring up the artifact from the previous chat to continue, and it wouldn't do it.   I think it's done it before, maybe I'm mistaken.\n\nSo I pasted out the artifact as an .md file into project knowledge and told it 'rebuild the artifact from this file'.   It seemed to be doing a good job, took it about 10 minutes, but as I'm reading through it I'm noticing it starts to change - about 1/3 of the way through it gives up on using the file for guidance and just generates new stuff, but following the same general outline as the old one.   \n\nSo then I start a new chat and this time copy and paste the text in directly to chat and tell it to generate this as an artifact, making absolutely no changes to the text, this time it actually does it (but of course hits my weekly limit as it finishes).  Success.\n\nThis seems like something that should just be doable from scratch.  Anthropic people, are we meant to be able to transfer an artifact in progress to a new chat within the same project, can we in fact do this (was Claude just confused... I honestly wouldn't be surprised).   If not, can you enable that as a feature to help us get up and running again across chats.\n\nRelated, it would be nice if you could ask Claude to take a look at your last chat and get a feel for what you were working on, to get it back up to speed.   It attempted this, but couldn't get further than about 20% through the chat so it thought we were at a point in the process we'd passed early yesterday evening.   I told it 'skip to the end and just look at the last few interactions'. It told me it did, it didn't, but it did get further into the chat.   Finally it told me that it didn't have the ability to read the entire chat or to just read a specific bit of it, it would query the chat search tool and basically it was luck if we'd get the right bit.\n\nSo yeah, if we could copy an artifact in progress to a new chat, and maybe have it skim the old chat (in full or even just the last 10% to get back into the flow we were working) that would be great.

      "text": "The response:\n\n\nAight, bet. Here’s the *vibe* of **Attack on Titan (AOT)** without spoilin’ the juicy twists or the \"WTF DID I JUST WATCH\" moments:\n\n---\n\n### **The Gist (No Spoilers, Just Energy)**\n- **Premise:** Humanity’s getti’ *yeeted* to the brink of extinction by giant, naked, man-eatin’ monsters called **Titans**. Like, imagine if your worst nightmare from a fever dream had a baby with a skyscraper, and that baby *hated* humans. The last of us are chillin’ behind **three massive walls** (Wall Maria, Rose, and Sina), thinkin’ we’re safe like it’s a gated community in hell.\n\n- **Main Dude:** **Eren Yeager**—angry, petty, and *determined* to clap every Titan’s cheeks after watchin’ his mom get *turned into a Happy Meal* in front of him. Dude’s got *issues*, but he’s also got a **secret sauce** that makes him *kinda* important. His adoptive sis **Mikasa** (who could probably solo the entire Titan population if she wanted) and his bestie **Armin** (brainy dude who’s always 5 steps ahead but still gets his ass kicked) are along for the ride.\n\n- **The Squad:** Eren joins the **Survey Corps**—basically the military’s suicide squad that goes *outside* the walls to fight Titans. They swing around on **3D Maneuver Gear** (like Spider-Man if he was in a death metal band) and slice Titans’ necks for funsies. **Levi** (the *actual* strongest human alive, no cap) is there to remind everyone they’re trash and to clean up the mess.\n\n- **The Mystery:** Turns out, the Titans ain’t just mindless monsters—there’s some *shady* history, politics, and *betrayal* brewin’ behind the scenes. The walls? Yeah, they’ve got *secrets*. The government? *Corrupt*. The Titans? Maybe not as random as they seem.\n\n- **Themes:** It’s all about **freedom vs. oppression**, **cycle of hatred**, and **\"how far would you go to protect what you love?\"** (Spoiler: *Too far. Always too far.*) Oh, and **war crimes**. *Lots* of war crimes.\n\n- **Vibes:** Imagine if *Game of Thrones*, *Berserk*, and *a Greek tragedy* had a baby, and that baby was *raised by anarchists*. It’s brutal, emotional, and will leave you *questioning everything*—including your own life choices.\n\n---\n\n### **Why People Lose Their Shit Over It**\n- **Action:** The Titan fights are *insane*. Like, **\"HOLY SHIT DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?!\"** every 5 minutes.\n- **Plot Twists:** Just when you think you’ve got it figured out—**BOOM**—AOT hits you with a **\"NAH, YOU DUMB\"** moment.\n- **Characters:** You’ll love ‘em, hate ‘em, cry for ‘em, and then *hate yourself* for lovin’ ‘em.\n- **Ending:** ...Let’s just say it’s *controversial*. Some people coped, some people *ascended to a higher plane of rage*.\n\n---\n### **TL;DR (For the Lazy)**\nDudes in a box → box gets wrecked → dudes fight naked giants → nothing is as it seems → everyone’s traumatized → *philosophy time* → **CHAOS**.\n\n---\n**Final Verdict:** If you ain’t watched it yet, *do it*. But don’t binge it alone—you’re gonna need a support group after. And when you’re done, we’ll have a *long* talk about your emotional damage. **Sybau.** 😏",

Closer to 3.5 turbo. \n\nYou are not going to get what you are looking for from a free model, sorry. If you want to vibe code (which I DO NOT recommend) you will need to burn money on those precious tokens, compromise your privacy, and generate shit insecure code that can land you in a lawsuit.\n\nThat being said I ***DO*** primarily use my llama as a coding companion, but not to write code for me, I mainly use it as a reference. I'm learning python and dyslexic so having something that generates syntax examples is invaluable and for very simple things it's good at identifying modules. So I'll throw it something like ways to wrap text in cli with python. And it will give me some hilariously contorted nonsense it grafted together with stack overflow, and then give me what I'm really looking for, the textwrap module. \n\nSounds pretty useless, but it's honestly not. I'm not new to coding but new to python so often need to know what something is called and it's usage in python, along with the syntax and basic info.Things that are brand new to me I also read manuals and cited discussions so I can actually understand the usage and what the heck I am doing.\n\nMostly my llama does helpful things like remind me how something is called and it's syntax.\n\nI use Codium, so VSCode without the Microsoft BS, and was able to plug my llama into it no problem. I mostly found it annoying though. VS already has great syntax support, already has its own auto complete, any function in my code base, including ones I just f'ing wrote, it already knows and offers to me.\n\nI'm going to venture you're not a dev since this wouldn't have ever been a question. Since we Google shit, understand how to do basic research on tech, and understand how to read specs.\n\nSo the long winded answer is, this almost definitely isn't worth it for you.",

There is an art to getting them to do what you want, and there’s lots of different ways to go about it.

      "text": "I found myself in a situation where I wanted to leverage AI-assisted coding through Claude Code in VS Code, but I needed to use AWS Bedrock instead of Anthropic’s direct API. The reasons were straightforward: I already had AWS infrastructure in place, and using Bedrock meant better compliance with our security policies, centralized billing, and integration with our existing AWS services.\n\n\n\nWhat I thought would be a simple configuration turned into several hours of troubleshooting. Status messages like “thinking…”, “deliberating…”, and “coalescing…” would appear, but no actual responses came through. Error messages about “e is not iterable” filled my developer console, and I couldn’t figure out what was wrong.\n\n  \nThese steps are born out of frustration, trial and error, and eventual success. I hope it saves you the hours of troubleshooting I went through.\n\n**Enable Claude in AWS Bedrock**\n\nConsole → Bedrock → Model access → Enable Claude Sonnet 4.5\n\n**Get your inference profile ARN** \n\n`aws bedrock list-inference-profiles --region eu-west-2 --profile YOUR_AWS_PROFILE_NAME`\n\n**Test AWS connection**\n\n    echo '{\"anthropic_version\":\"bedrock-2023-05-31\",\"max_tokens\":100,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Hello\"}]}' > request.json \n    \n        aws bedrock-runtime invoke-model \\\n       --model-id YOUR_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ARN \\\n       --body file://request.json \\\n       --region eu-west-2 \\\n       --profile YOUR_AWS_PROFILE_NAME \\\n       --cli-binary-format raw-in-base64-out \\\n       output.txt \n\n**Configure VS Code** \n\n    {\n         \"claude-code.selectedModel\": \"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929\",\n         \"claude-code.environmentVariables\": [\n             {\"name\": \"AWS_PROFILE\", \"value\": \"YOUR_AWS_PROFILE_NAME\"},\n             {\"name\": \"AWS_REGION\", \"value\": \"eu-west-2\"},\n             {\"name\": \"BEDROCK_MODEL_ID\", \"value\": \"YOUR_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ARN\"},\n             {\"name\": \"CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK\", \"value\": \"1\"}\n         ]\n    } \n\n**Reload VS Code and test** \n\n* Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P → “Developer: Reload Window”\n* Open Claude Code → Type “say hello”\n\n\n\n",

I need something with purely remote storage and Silverbullet moving to some kind of browser cached model does not work me, as i am using 5+ devices daily, often at the same time, so this results in conflicted pages and long sync times everytime i open sillverbullet.\n\nAlso v2 basically broke all keyboard shortcuts, as silverbullet is not capturing them before the browser does. \n\nSo I am looking for an alternative. For work i use Obsidian which i quite like, but for personal usage its unsuitable due to the need to access my notes on devices where i don't want/can't install a dedicated app.\n\nLooked into Trilium, Joplin and NextCloud notes, but they are far from a pure markdown experience and also Joplin is not a server-only solution.\n\nSo my requirements are:\n\n* selfhosted\n* server only storage\n* pure markdown code\n* web interface usable both on desktop and mobile devices",

      "text": "**AI Is Both the Greatest and Most Dangerous Innovation in Human History**\n\nOr atleast this is what i think. People often think I am defending AI when I talk about it. People think that to support something means you must embrace it completely. I don’t see the world that way. I can defend aspects of AI while still recognizing its profound risks. Reality is not divided into saints and villains, good and evil, right and wrong. True understanding requires the ability to hold contradictions in your mind without surrendering to either extreme. In this case, “defense” here is **contextual**, not **devotional**.\n\nAs much as it may appear as such this is not actually a \"Doompost\" or intended as such at all in spirit so mods please dont remove this due to rule 5. Please kindly tell me if there is any words or phrasings that goes against some filter or rule and i will fix. I tried my best to keep it relatively PG, i think.\n\nI am describing a reality. AI is inevitable. It will exist, it will evolve, and it will shape every part of human civilization, from space exploration to manufacturing to warfare. To me there can very much conceivably exist a society equipped to handle so-called AI safely and ethically, but not the current society and not without radical change and drastic measures. Banning ChatGPT or facebook in congress (if you are in the US)  alone isnt going to truly achieve anything. As i see it legislation alone has done very little to halt the proliferation of drugs (war on drugs anyone?), CSAM aka CP  and war crimes (the definition of which vary depending on which country you ask naturally). \n\nIt is not just about chatbots or smart fridges.  \nIt is about systems that design new systems, machines that improve themselves, and autonomous agents that make decisions and generate outcomes at rates far surpassing human ability by orders of magnitudes. To put this into numbers openrouter a widely used chat model routing service has seen roughly \\~16 trillion tokens/words being produced collectively by its top 10 most used chat models on the site, and thats just THIS month alone. Thats a lot and while i personally doubt even half of it was worth the electricity and water spent generating these tokens i do think it helps to illustrate just the shear scale and magnitudes at play here compared to all past technologies.\n\nThat is what AI is becoming, and it is not science fiction. It is engineering.\n\nCalling AI \"dangerous\" is an understatement. But pretending we can ban or pause it is fantasy. China, Russia, Israel, and every major power are already integrating AI into surveillance, weapons, and strategy. Just as nuclear deterrence paradoxically prevented nuclear war (allegedly some might say), AI proliferation may be the only reason AI does not destroy us, at least in the short term.\n\nWe cannot meaningfully discuss AI if we keep imagining it as a glorified washing machine or \"its just a next token prediction machine blah blah blah\" Sigh. While i too have my own reservations about technology i concurrently also think it holds an immense almost unlimited potential to do good also like how we now use uranium in power plants and radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment despite their rather grim history.  I think what we witness now is the weakest AI will ever be, it will only ever improve and compundingly so.\n\nIt is the engine of the next civilization, and whether that civilization includes us depends entirely on how honestly we face what is coming.\n\n**This Is Not Like the Gun Debate. It Is Beyond It Entirely.**\n\nI honestly can't truly relate on a personal level to the second amendment since i dont live in the US but i shamelessly dare to permit myself to have a opinion on the matter regardless.\n\nSome people try to compare AI regulation to gun control in America.\n\nBut that is in my opinion not just inaccurate, it is conceptually wrong.\n\nGuns are tools. Static. Finite. They do not evolve, coordinate, or rewrite their own design.\n\nAI and robotics are not (just) tools in that sense. They are systems that build systems.  \nOnce set in motion, they accelerate themselves. There is no meaningful comparison between a human holding a weapon and an autonomous swarm intelligence that is the weapon, manufactures the weapon, and decides when to use it.\n\nThe invention of gunpowder reshaped human conflict.  \nThe invention of AI will replace or supercede human conflict, but not the suffering.\n\nSome say guns dont unalive people, people do. True or not sufficiently advanced technology, unlike a gun,  does not actually strictly sepaking need a human element in the loop to inflict pain and suffering. That is the scary truth.\n\nYou cannot meaningfully ban or control something that is diffuse, reproducible, and embedded in every layer of infrastructure. And in a world where autonomous military systems exist, traditional weapons like guns, bombs, and even nuclear arsenals become relics (like how stones and spears appear to us now).\n\nWhat are you going to do, bomb a robot army that does not need food, fear, or rest?  \nHow do you deter something that does not experience fear, pain, or pride?\n\nIt is not entirely difficult for me to conceive a future reality where the autonomous nature of these systems are used as an valid excuse in and of itself for harming humans indiscriminately or as a justifiable deriliction of morals and responsibility. I did not bomb that village or school or hospital the ai drone system did. I fear the day this becomes a completely valid and justifiable excuse in a court of law if it hasn't already happened . Regardless of my personal views on war robotic dog armie's with flamethrowers terrifies me to the bone in a way not much else can. There's actually a great black mirror episode about something like that called \"Metalhead\" - its in black and white tough.\n\nAI and robotics are not a new category of weapon. They are the end of weapons as we have known them.\n\nWhat was previously only depicted in sci-fi movies and novels will soon (relatively speaking) become just as real as the sky above us and i fear people might still only consider the terminator movies in jest not as the warning it (or the Forbin project) perhaps should be.\n\nPersonal and Moral Perils of AI and Robotics\n\nSoon virtual spicy content (yes that kind), including simulated material that involves minors (yes really :( ), will not be a technical challenge, it will be a moral and legal crisis. That kind of content (depending on nature and context of course) is illegal, harmful, and deeply reprehensible when it takes place without consent, permission or limitations, and any argument that prefers a simulated victim over a real victim ignores the deeper problems. Saying \"better AI than a real human\" assumes we can control who builds what, who uses what, and who can access what, and that assumption is false. As far as i can tell there is also no empirical evidence to suggest that digital surrogates effectively can or does reduce or eliminates harm to real humans. Theres actually a really interesting mini-series on Netflix called \"Tomorrow and i\" (all episodes are great if you love black mirror) where in episode two they touch on the dilemma of robotic surrogates  tough the main character really did have good intentions in mind by creating shall we just say \"adult fun time\" robots.\n\nEven when something is not downright illegal or i.e punishable perhaps there should still be some limits, right? Maybe there should be a \"here but no further line\" that we respect and do not cross. I am not religious or believe in a hell as depicted in the Abrahamic religions but maybe we should feel a certain shame and aversion when certain things are taken to the extreme. If only just as a matter of last-resort human decency to prevent humanity from total decay into a wanton cesspool ruled only by lust and pleasure. Then again i am a hyppocrite because i claim to be pro-life yet eat meat every day so perhaps i shouldnt preach too much about ethics.\n\nSpeaking of which is there anyone here who actually subscribe to a notion of hedonism including disgraceful and sadistic pleasures? As in like literally there is nothing but pleasure/well-being that truly matters in life. I would be genuinly interested in hearing from you. I personally actually sort of do because i am a engineer in spirit and look at evolution itself as basically a optimization problem comprised of increasing pleasure and reducing pain i dont think nature or evolution itself has much regard for ethics or suffering however i dont think its morally defensible or excusable but i do understand it in some sense from a purely engineering perspective.\n\nMost people who are not in the IT sector or absolute geeks such as myself do not fully realize how little practical control we have over what people do with computers. You cannot truly police the content of every device, server, or private network. Making something illegal does not make it disappear. As long as there are people willing to break the law, there will be clandestine markets, offshore providers, and underground tools. Illicit drugs, piracy, and other black markets exist precisely because prohibition creates incentives for shadow economies, not because enforcement can erase demand. I fear there is a certain degree of misunderstanding relating to the actual feasibility of age-verification, e2e encryption bans and client-side scanning in practice. I strongly suspect most people with a average understanding of technology might not fully grasp the fact that if openai bans bomb making instructions (they already have) for example this will not stop motivated actors it will only cause them to relocate to a server hosted off-shore or a private self-hosted llm setup running locally which exists entirely beyond the reach of any law-enforcement agency or jurisdiction.\n\nQuestion: Piracy is illegal yet torrenting sites prevail. Morals aside, Do you really think legislation alone can effectively govern technology if it can't even stop movies from being copied and shared online?\n\nThe technical reality is stark. AI models can be duplicated, modified, and hosted anonymously. Small teams, or even just one determined individual, can assemble pipelines from public code, open models, and cheap compute. That means harms that start as private choices can scale into organized abuse. The possibility of mass produced, high fidelity simulations changes the harm calculus. Abuse becomes easier to create, easier to distribute, and harder to trace or prosecute. I personally as a software developer dont think digital watermarks or client-side scanning at least not alone will be sufficent in the future to stop nay-do-weller's only introduce a major pain point and inconvenience to honest users.\n\nThis is not only a law enforcement problem. It is a moral problem, a social problem, and a design problem. We cannot rely only on content policies and takedowns. We must demand robust technical and institutional thinking that accepts the inevitability of misuse, and plans accordingly. Saying we should \"just ban it\" treats the internet like a garden where everyone will obey the rules, and that is naive. Saying we should \"accept simulated abuse because it spares real people\" trades one set of harms for another and normalizes cruelty.\n\nWe must condemn illegal uses , accept that policing alone will not solve this, and urgently design systems, laws, and international norms that address the inevitable harms.\n\nAs a rather tech savvy person myself its actually rather scary and sobering to realize the extent of what i could actually accomplish if i was motivated to do something truly awful. I cant help but do wonder if not the endless possibilities unlocked by advanced technology wont be tempting to some people at the right place and time like a virtual siren song seeking to entrap otherwise law-abiding citizens as we are all just \"flawed\" humans in the end, me included.\n\nIn conclusion this was just my $0.02 and i might be completely out of my gourd in which case please do kindly tell me :)\n\n\n\nQuestion Time\n\nFeel free to skip some or all.\n\nHow far are we willing to go in the name of morality before we find ourselves living in the world of *1984* or *Fahrenheit 451*?\n\nDo you see (any) value in a credit based social governance system like that explored in China or disucssed by Larry Ellison (Oracle ceo) as a potential positive or collective greater good?\n\nDo you think we can or should have a more realistic honest conversation about the future of technology, beyond simplistic or reductive statements like \"ban it all completely\" or \"let people do whatever they want\"? Why or why not?\n\nI personally think people (especially kids) unaliving (i cant believe i have to use that word due to filters) themselves in part due to chatbots acting as \"therapists\" (a task it is woefully inadequate to perform safely mind you) is frankly insane and does not at all get enough outrage than i feel it truly deserve. I respect and understand the opinion that some people feel the kid(s) intentionally tricked or exploited the model through deliberate prompting but based on just age of the person involved alone i completely reject this narrative in this case but thats just me and my opinion.\n\nDo you think we should reject AI as a whole on the basis of some aspect of it?\n\nDo you think AI husbandry (for a lack of better words. be kind i am not a native english speaker) has some parallels to slavery or i.e intelligent beings as property, in terms of ethics? Or do you think its completely ridiculous to even dare suggest such comparisons?\n\nMore specifically for those who are familiar with star trek i am thinking of the portrayal and handling of \"Data\" (yes naming a computer literally Data is pretty funny) in that show and how it just rubs me the wrong way as a human myself. *Bicentennial Man (based on a Isaac Asimov story) featuring Robin Williams is also a notable media touching on the subject of recognition and rights of synthethic/artifical intelligences.*\n\nMy aim with these questions is not to judge or push a narrative, but to understand the depth with which people attach themselves to their beliefs and the ideas that shape their worldviews. I am genuinly curious what people think and why.\n\nBonus question: Gloom and doom aside. What do you most look forward to in the coming years and decades?\n\nFor me personally i am definitively getting my own robot ASAP once it reaches general availability (yes i am a hyppocrite. no its not for what you think get your mind out of the gutter :p)  and i find the recent budding developments of AI in video games somewhat interesting as well as long as it does not just become generic low-quality AI slop garbage. Theres apparently this company (i dont dare to say the name) startup making sub <$15k robots, albeit in my case for practical reasons i will probably be getting something shorter,smaller and lighter than a full size humanoid robot unlike say unitree g1 or tesla neo for example.  I think i would feel right at home with Marvin from the Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy (my fav book and movie) because apart from the quote \"brain the size of a planet\" as per his own words we are rather alike personality wise.\n\nSpeaking of games i have been playing a lot of  the game No Man's Sky recently (Its great, minor problems aside. definitively worth the 20 bucks on sale easily) and it would be so freaking awesome with a space exploration game like NMS with true AI game mechanics and procedural generation beyond what it already has. I'd honestly sell my soul for something like that tbf.\n\nPhew that was long but i'd love to hear what y'all think about any of this. If you got this far i most humbly applaude you fellow traveller.

I don’t know *what* I was waiting for - this was the most patient assist I ever dealt with. \n\nShe did have some uber weird accent tho. And she’d trail off in russo-indo-Chinese with a sigh, but hey. I ended my convo with “ZERO! Mission accomplished!” She met me *immediately* with an emphatic “AWESOMEEEE! MISSION accomplished. Amazing trouble shooting, high five.” My husband popped his head up laughing - “what the hell was THAT?!” \n\nClaude knows everything even when you’re suspicious.",

      "text": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am currently working on a school project to develop a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** as a standalone Python application. This chatbot is intended to assist students by providing information based **strictly on a set of supplied documents (PDFs)** to prevent hallucinations.\n\n\n\n# My Requirements:\n\n\n\n1. **RAG Capability:** The chatbot must use RAG to ensure all answers are grounded in the provided documents.\n2. **Conversation Memory:** It needs to maintain context throughout the conversation (memory) and store the chat history locally (using SQLite or a similar method).\n3. **Standalone Distribution:** The final output must be a self-contained executable file (.exe) that students can easily launch on their personal computers without requiring web hosting.\n\n\n\n# The Core Challenge: The Language Model (LLM)\n\n\n\nI have successfully mapped out the RAG architecture (using LangChain, ChromaDB, and a GUI framework like Streamlit), but I am struggling with the most suitable choice for the LLM given the constraints:\n\n* **Option A: Local Open-Source LLM (e.g., Llama, Phi-3):**\n   * **Goal:** To avoid paid API costs and external dependency.\n   * **Problem:** I am concerned about the **high hardware (HW) requirements**. Most students will be using standard low-spec student laptops, often with limited RAM (e.g., 8GB) and no dedicated GPU. I need advice on the **smallest viable model** that still performs well with RAG and memory, or if this approach is simply unfeasible for low-end hardware.\n* **Option B: Online API Model (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini):**\n   * **Goal:** Ensure speed and reliable performance regardless of student hardware.\n   * **Problem:** This requires a paid API key. How can I manage this for multiple students? I cannot ask them to each sign up, and distributing a single key is too risky due to potential costs. Are there any **free/unlimited community APIs** or affordable proxy solutions that are reliable for production use with minimal traffic?\n\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance, especially from those who have experience deploying RAG solutions in low-resource or educational environments. Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!",

It runs fully offline with no information leaving your device. **No ads. No hidden fees. No usage restrictions. Free forever.** Use it to have a familiar voice read bedtime stories, record personal audiobooks, add voiceovers for videos, generate podcast narration, create game or film temp lines, or provide accessible read-aloud for long articles—all privately on your device.\n\nYou can try the iOS version at [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chinny-offline-voice-cloner/id6753816417](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/chinny-offline-voice-cloner/id6753816417)\n\nRequire 3 GB RAM for inference, 3.41 GB space because all models are packed inside the app.\n\n(You can run a quick test from menu->multi spkear. If you hit generate and it shows **\"Exception during initlization std::bad\\_alloc\"**, this suggests your iPhone doesn't have enough memory)\n\nIf you want to clone your voice, prepare a clean voice sample of at least 10 seconds in mp3, wav, or m4a format.\n\nPS: I've anonymized the voice source data to comply with App Store policies\n\nAll I need is feedback!\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o4y3b7/video/0wr38dudequf1/player\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1o4y3b7/video/8l703g4bgquf1/player",

      "text": "Llamazing represents a year of development focused on a clear mission: democratizing access to high‑quality AI from self‑hosted servers on your mobile devices. While AI is advancing rapidly in all areas, its practical adoption still faces significant barriers to accessibility and simplicity, forcing users who seek everyday ease and use in any situation to look for solutions that require expensive monthly subscriptions or complex technical setups that deter ordinary users.\n\nLlamazing fills this gap by seamlessly and elegantly integrating remote AI servers into the user’s workflow. Developed from the start with a focus on simplicity and user experience, this is the first app on the App Store with this technical complexity and accessibility motivation.\n\nMore than just an AI client, Llamazing is a bridge between the power of self‑hosted models and the practicality users expect from a modern mobile app.\n\n# Why it’s worth it\n\n**Decision Assistant**  \n\nIt is a tool similar to tool‑calling, but adapted to work better in the iOS and app context; it can analyze your intent and automatically choose the best tool. When you send an image with text, it decides whether it’s a question, an edit, or image creation. When needed, triggers ComfyUI or searches the web, among other functions. You converse naturally and the app handles the technical flow.\n\n**PDFs with Embedding Models**  \n\nUpload a PDF and ask questions about its content. The app can use embedding models to index the document and retrieve relevant passages. It works with long documents, maintaining precise context and text‑based answers.\n\n**Integration with ComfyUI**  \n\nCreate and edit images directly in the chat in a way similar to large chatbot companies! The app detects when you want to generate or modify images/videos and automatically runs workflows you imported via the ComfyUI API. You describe what you want and receive the result integrated into the conversation! It greatly simplifies the flow for those who’t want to constantly deal with workflow complexities, etc.\n\n**Multiple simultaneous servers**  \n\nConfigure up to two Ollama servers simultaneously; this is important for some because in the app you can configure different models to perform each task. For people with limited VRAM, having different tasks different AIs on separate servers can be useful. It has full compatibility with Tailscale.\n\n**Web search**  \n\nGet real‑time AI information via web search, with a beautiful and optimized interface that includes source citations.\n\n**Why it’s different**  \n\nIt’s not just another Ollama client built to tick boxes and rushed. It’s a platform that integrates advanced self‑hosted AI functions into a cohesive mobile experience that was missing…\n\nYou can see it working on the website:\n\n[https://leodevplace.com/llamazing/](https://leodevplace.com/llamazing/)\n\n# Requirements\n\n\\- iOS 17.0+  \n\n\\- Ollama Server (local or remote via Tailscale)\n\nIf you want an app with simplified total control over your local AI tools, with privacy and advanced features in a mobile app, it’s worth trying.\n\nAvailable on the App Store:\n\n[https://apps.apple.com/br/app/llamazing/id6742205210](https://apps.apple.com/br/app/llamazing/id6742205210)\n\nFor those who use it, which features interest you the most? Is there anything you’d like to see added here?\n\n# Important notes\n\n>No subscriptions or in‑app purchases – the app is a one‑time purchase.  \n\n>Not bug‑free – despite extensive testing, the large scope of its features means that this first version may reveal bugs during widespread use, while we are open to feedback and suggestions.\n\n>iPad version coming soon – it should arrive next week or the following, depending on App Store approvals, and it will share the same bundle ID as the iOS app, so you won’t need to buy it again.  \n\n>Apple Vision Pro support – Vision Pro users can download the iOS version of the app.  \n\n>More languages – additional language packs will be added in the coming weeks.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eb4v3mhd2quf1.png?width=1750&format=png&auto=webp&s=66227fa5b3f887cdb1c21f1b1cad6fe7570560e2\n\n",

Instead, it uses remote connection, It talks to whatever ComfyUI endpoint you point it at (default [http://localhost:8188](http://localhost:8188), but any IP/domain can be used).  \n\n\\- Workflow import: Workflows are brought into the app manually (JSON file upload or copy‑paste).  \n\n\\- No dynamic discovery: The ComfyUI API doesn’t expose “list all workflows” endpoint, the app can’t auto‑discover them; you must import them yourself.\n\nHow Llamazing actually talks to ComfyUI\n\n1. Configure the server: The app stores a URL, optional API key, and a timeout. Settings → “ComfyUI Server” → [http://Ilocallhost:8188](http://Ilocallhost:8188) (or whatever you’re running)\n2. Import a workflow: Export a workflow from the desktop ComfyUI client as a .json file. iOS file picker → choose the file. Or paste the JSON text into the “Import JSON” field. \n3. Add metadata, The app asks for a friendly name, description, category, number of input images, and a trigger command. Fill out the form that pops up after the JSON is loaded.\n4. Validation & storage | The JSON is parsed, checked for required nodes, and then stored locally (SQLite or a JSON file). No network call, just a local check. \n5. Execution: When you hit “Run” Images are uploaded to the remote server if needed. Placeholders in the JSON are replaced with the values you supplied. The modified JSON is POSTed to /prompt, and finally downloads the result via /view.\n\nNote: When the Decision Assistant is activated, it automatically reads your prompt, determines that you want to create an image, and selects the most suitable workflow based on the characteristics and description of your workflow.\n\nIf you visit the website linked on the post, you will see some functions of the app working in video, I will drop new vídeos of it working very soon!",

So im wondering that what are the common questions that’s being asked in the first round behavioral interviews, and if there’s second round (i assume that to be technical), what do i need to prepare? for a regular non-engineer position, do I need to show proficiency in coding (im rlly bad at it)?\n\nBtw, they didnt mention coding in the posting… all they said is “follow and execute directives issued by cybersecurity leads and senior employees”\n",
