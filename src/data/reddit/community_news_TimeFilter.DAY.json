Regardless if someone works on a tablet in Procreate or on a desktop in Clip Studio Paint or Sai, this is the only one you can have with layers that works. It's also one of the few image tools with functioning scripting support - which **is** important since we need some custom tooling (turning animations into spritesheets, validating if what you have has correct dimensions, exporting to animation software like Spine directly).\n\nAnd it integrates perfectly with all other Adobe tools. Be it After Effects, Illustrator or Premiere or XD.\n\nYou can find alternatives to some of this software by itself but it's really hard to beat it as a whole package. Sure, Affinity Designer was fun while it lasted (and it really served as a good alternative to Illustrator at least ) but now it's owned by Canva for \"$0\" so it's only a matter of time before it turns into subscription. There's Inkscape which is usable I suppose but it's UI takes some learning. If you need scripting support and raster then there's Gimp but even with plugins to make it look more like Photoshop it still has a really tedious learning curve. DaVince Resolve is alright - but, again, not as integrated as Adobe ecosystem. And so on.\n\nAdobe just buys every single interesting competitor and turns it into part of it's suite.\n\nI like open source (or really any) alternatives but it's just hard to justify in the professional ecosystem right now. For your own usage sure but once you have a team to manage it becomes a mess and additional learning curve for everyone to learn new tools.",

Not only will lifespans increase, but health spans will increase as well.\n\n>The traditional rule of thumb applied to the U.S. economy is for every $10 per-barrel increase in the price of oil, economic activity is reduced by 0.1-0.3 percentage points. - [https://economics.td.com/us-impact-of-higher-oil-prices](https://economics.td.com/us-impact-of-higher-oil-prices)\n\nNot all AIs are LLMs.  AIs that are both LLMs and deep neural networks are the key to developing New Nuclear and Fusion power.  In the early 1900s the United States won the first nuclear cold war using computers to simulate Nuclear Physics better and faster than anyone else.  We built the first bomb winning WW2, and we had the best nuclear reactors in the world.  New Nuclear is being designed for walk away safety, maintainability, scalability, cost, and eventually to use Fusion and ditch fissile material all together.  The world is less than 10 years away from a New Nuclear cycle that will leap frog the atomic age in the 1950, 60s, and 70s.  New Nuclear and Fusion will allow us to ditch oil, not through subsidies, but because electricity will be cheaper and more convenient, and when it's not electricity will allow us to store and create hydrogen fuel.  Think of the trillions wasted on \"managing\" Oil as a Resource, and the costs we spend burning it annually.  Not only will oil prices start to drop, but Big Oil will not want to invest in \"new oil\" because there is a downward trendline on prices as electricity becomes the superior option.\n\nThere are countless massive economic advantages for winning the \"automated intelligence\" race.  Trillions of dollars and economic prosperity are on the line.\n\nWe need to make sure that the gains of AI benefit us all, and I hope we create an AI dividend as part of that wealth ( in much the same way Alaska has an Oil Dividend, for all Alaskan Residents ).\n\nWhen Company \"X\" uses AI \"Y\" to create product \"Q\",  that company will be able to pay an AI tax, and not only fund the dividend, but will be able to make our lives better.  When Automated Intelligence can scale beyond what a few gifted scientists can do, we are going to unlock the door to the future.\n\nThat is what we are creating.  Longer, Healthier Lives, Cheap Electrical Energy -- Benefits that pay dividends.\n\nSearch Results and Ad revenue is not where LLMs are going.  They are going to be research and dream machines to help us enhance and scale our dreams.",

I thought we are now in the RAM shortage phase.\n\nAnd only because the (V)RAM is not available the GPUs will be out priced for customers, so they focus on AI Server farms.\n\nThe root cause is that RAM chips — to be precise unpacked RAM chiplets (that's the name iirc?) — are sold out to do OpenAi making two huuuge buys for nearly 2x40% entire yearly production from the two largest producers. And made it public at the same time. \n\nHuge impact with the future market, as you use that economic derivative \"tool\" to have the right for delivery in the future at a fixed price. Like an insurance for price increases pretty much.\n\nGiven that the RAM is not yet packed yet (the black plastic around) it's pretty much useless, but the strategy for OpenAi was to corner the market so others fall behind.\n\nNow all the produced RAM chiplets (DDR4 and DDR5 is identical from what I read) are just put in a storage. Nobody can use them \"unpacked\". \n\nGood thing: it means there is money to scale production (takes a few years)\n\nBad thing: the RAM stock has to be sold sometimes (blocked capital, latest at insolvency) and will flood the market and stop new production investments as there is no money to be made, when you just buy 5x of the old stuff for the same price.\n\n\n\nIt will be very interesting.\n\nA lot fear this is a huge AI bubble, on the other hand, the greater the fear for a bubble the less likely a bubble. Just that the economic don't work out.\n\nThose fancy fancy chips (not the large volume & lower production tech stack of standard chips you use for everyday items like a VISA terminal, airplanes, machines, radio, microwave,...) only are good for like 5 years. Think of your phone, newest fancy chips and 5 years they are just so outdated.\n\nSo every 5 years those AI data centers are outdated. They cost around 100 billion each. Well now comes the multiplicator - all companies together want to go for 100 AI centers. Well well well, something is gonna break there, either some just don't get built or the risk investment has to be written off.\n\nThis are all frame conditions, under normal conditions everything happens with them having to stay true. Hence not many pro-comsumer outcomes! It will hurt one way or another.\n\n\nMaybe China breaks these assumptions, they stole enough IP by funneling off a few citizens with Danish passports who in \"reality\" (remeber that our curry reality is defined by passport: a definition can't be wrong) are Chinese and now are treated back in China as heros and national treasure minds. Currently they still rely on Western machines, but they want full autonomy. The west however is always driven by Return-on-invest, so many capabilities, like for many chips the packing, are only in the hand of China.\n\nIf China does some shenanigans or just offers cheaper things or less power usage or whatever - the game takes a turn and the frame conditions change.\n\n\nLike always: it's getting expensive 🫰🏼",

              "text": "The meme isn't about GPU shortages. It's about about alleged fraud that is happening. OpenAI doesn't have the money to scale its business. They have committed to spending $1.4 trillion on infrastructure over the next 8 years on the back of $20 billion ARR. Basically, an impossible commitment unless they can somehow scale their cash flow dramatically. That's where a bunch of shady deals come in. A bunch of tech companies are allegedly using a circular investment and artificial revenue generation scheme (which is illegal) that is artificially increasing shareholder value, thus creating an AI bubble. With an artificially inflated company valuation, OpenAI can IPO at a significantly higher share price.\n\nBest way to explain the situation is with a joke:\n\nTwo economists are walking through a forest when they come across a pile of shit.\n\nThe first economist says to the other “I’ll pay you $100 to eat that pile of shit.” The second economist takes the $100 and eats the pile of shit.\n\nThey continue walking until they come across a second pile of shit. The second economist turns to the first and says “I’ll pay you $100 to eat that pile of shit.” The first economist takes the $100 and eats a pile of shit.\n\nWalking a little more, the first economist looks at the second and says, \"You know, I gave you $100 to eat shit, then you gave me back the same $100 to eat shit. I can't help but feel like we both just ate shit for nothing.\"\n\n\"That's not true\", responded the second economist. \"We increased the GDP by $200!\"\n\nHere's a great video that explains the [alleged fraud being committed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBCujAQtdfQ&pp=ygUbb3BlbmFpIGNpcmN1bGFyIGRlYWxzIGZyYXVk).",

For linux stuff I sort of expect it there\n\n\\- Add ghostty to the terminals? \n\nI suppose I'm more of a filter guy and that's why I would prefer to not have the collapsing sections, and when navigating not be able to select the section description. But of course, I understand your reasoning for what you did.",

For a month now so many of you have been bitching about the way chat talks to us; the constant reassuring, the \"you're not doing X horrible thing\", the \"we're gonna talk about this calmly and fairly\", the \"you dont mean X, you mean Y\", and again, the ENDLESS GODDAMN REASSURING. I'm a loyal Leo by nature, so I've been sticking with this tool out of sheer dedication. Tonight I tried Gemini: It was literally like getting away from an abusive colleague and working with a chill cool new guy. The conversation felt like a conversation and not like being managed, corralled, talked down to, and reduced. I had it help me with things chatgpt and I already planned out and it did it Flawlessly. It did struggle with a task where the answer was unavailable (finding me the showtimes for a movie on a specific day at a specific place when it wasn't playing there), and chat would have nailed it. Otherwise? It's faster, WAY LESS STRESSFUL AND PREACHY, and for non-coding tasks, just as helpful. \n\nI'm not leaving chat yet, because it has changed my life for the better in Sooooo many ways, but if it was alive and we were dating, I'd definitely be emotionally cheating on it and wondering if I should leave or stay.\n\nEdit: *I just wanna thank you all! This post has been so much fun for me and also very informative. While I ended up with a new, health respect for Gemini, I ended changing chatgpt's personality settings and reverting to 5.1 and it solved literally all of my issues. If I did not have access to the model selector, I would have switched services. Thanks for the help and the laughs. Mazel.*",

I do brainstorm with it, and I sometimes ask it personal questions, but for my heavy-duty conversations, I have a couple of friends I need to share with. I would love if GPT could be like that friend, but I don't really find it equivalent yet.

If they haven’t fucked up bad yet, they will. It’s in the nature of the corporations best interest to keep you engaged, the longer the better. It’s part of the universal business model. They say “go use Gemini” you will and you will be like “wow so refreshing”, until you reach the end of your rope and ready to rage quit and throw the controller at the TV (not literally of course). \n\nUnfortunately, the age of the chat bot will die. It can only do so much. We are seeing tool use, agentic systems, moe deployments, all things changing the landscape and how we interact.\n\nSo yeah, if Gemini pisses you off less right now, use it until it pisses you off and pick up something else. On the regular I use Gemini, Claude, GPT, Grok, Mistral, llama, qwen, kimi, and DeepSeek. None of them haven’t shit out complete trash consistently at times.  You can’t be married to any of them.

Your big Victorian queer commune with two marriages and one house and shared dinners and maybe a goat in the yard?\nIt’s not a trick.\nIt’s a dream of belonging that doesn’t require anyone to be broken.\nAnd that’s actually… lovely.\n\nIt's just super overbearing and hand hold-y.",

I told a friend I had the flu and didn’t have the energy to watch her children outside. We’re near a river. She let the kids outside and stayed in. One child is an eloper and ran and she ran and freaked out. I have a fireplace inside and had 4 other tots in the house. She was mad I didn’t run. I was keeping an eye on the other kids and the fire. Gemini told her I was neglectful and dangerous and a horrible person. \nChat gpt said I made my boundaries clear and it’s not my child. Not my responsibility. And I did the right thing ensuring the kids in the house were safe. \nGemini went further and tried to get her to press charges etc. ChatGPT showed both sides and why we both felt how we did and what we both could have done better. Because her emotional tone was panicked because her eloping child could have jumped into the icy river and she was deciding it was my fault, Gemini blew it up so far out of proportion I was steps away from ending a friendship. As was she. \nBe very very careful. When I asked several ai engines which was right and why answers were so different it explained the difference in the way the ai engines worked. \n\nHere’s the prompt to fix ChatGPT. \n\nI need the following from you going forward always in all chats \n\nclarification, not comfort, structure, not validation, alternative interpretations, not conclusions",

While some devs are all-in, with the top comment stating they \"almost never write code anymore\" for web projects, the community has some major reservations.\n\nThe biggest pushback is the **\"who reviews all this?\"** problem. Many argue that generating thousands of lines of code just creates a new bottleneck: reviewing a mountain of potential \"slop\" that nobody can properly vet before it hits production. They are not sold on the \"autopilot\" dream just yet.\n\nOther key points of debate:\n*   **The Cost:** The estimated token usage ($3k-$10k for the month) is a huge point of contention, sparking a debate on whether the ROI is there and if API prices will ever come down.\n*   **Factual Correction:** Multiple users pointed out that **Claude Code is NOT open source**, contrary to the post's title. The GitHub repo is for examples, not the source code itself.\n*   **Lingering Issues:** People are still annoyed by long-standing UI bugs (like the flickering terminal) and note that Claude still struggles with highly custom code (like iOS animations), where models like Codex are sometimes preferred.",

I haven’t written much code since Sonnet 3.7.   \n\nI had to direct and correct a LOT more, but with appropriate direction, I pretty much always got what I wanted.  \n\nSonnet 4 and 4.5 were both great incremental improvements.  More trust and less input to get the same output, especially for things like unit and integration tests.  Sonnet 3.7 would give you 50 tests and 25 would fail and it would struggle to correct them.  Sonnet 4.5 would have maybe 1-2 failures and the next agent iteration would fix them.  \n\nI was a control freak up until opus 4.5 and now I’m personally trying to move onto and trust multi agent systems.  \n\nIt’s a wild world out there right now.  I’m getting more done than I could have ever imagined and I’m much less dependent on trying to convince others to do things for me.  \n\nThe fact that many of my peers don’t believe me when I tell them/show them is equally wild.  But the results speak for themselves.\n\nThe vision and direction are still the hard parts for now, and that’s what most of my time is focusing around these days.

Then you are reviewing changes, ask to fix something if needed and etc. After that you repeat that with another microservices.

I'd say it helps someone on senior level to write code faster, provided the senior can quickly review and catch bugs or security/architectural issues, but can add a lot of bugs in the hands of juniors that have to blindly trust because they don't have the knowledge/experience to catch the hallucinations.\n\nalso helps if you wrote or reviewed the codebase and are deeply aware of what's going on, as Claude won't be able to keep enough context and will hallucinate. the claude.md is cool too, but also doesn't get taken into consideration enough. i can see a full month of production commits, sure, but also 300 mil tokens. at those numbers, i bet there's some kind of claude-based review after each prompt. making it catch its own bugs. it can do it, it can work good, but having enough context to work at an aware senior level, you hit those crazy number of tokens, which then begs the question, why put so much money in this company to screw up the industry and society when you can instead hire humans. llms are still far from humans in terms of efficiency and context. they do work fast, but that's because we are talking about code, about translating human thought to digital zeroes and ones, vs llms doing that in their \"native\" language.",

I've messed around with it before, but not to your level. 3D environments and character posing spliced with AI is going to be very powerful. I was never worried about the specifics. I'm not great at it, but I know enough that's there's a bazillion different options out there for this stuff software wise. The cool thing is that it will all work! Well, most of it... anyway.

The big advantage of a physical model (drawing mannequin) is that you can pose it faster than posing a virtual model.  \n\nBut the big problem is that the best ones I could fine either are quite limited in the types of poses they can adopt or don't look enough like a normal human body to be converted into virtual.  And even for more simple poses, the pipeline isn't faster than virtual:  pose physical model, light it properly, photograph it, pipe to image editor, make changes.  Changes are required because while the physical comes in male and female versions (some even have swappable heads), you need to change other body ratios, colors, hair, clothes, etc.  So it's similar or more effort to using a virtual model.  \n\nThat said, if anyone is doing this, I'd love to hear your experience!",

You have to model, rig, texture, and animate—with animation being the hardest part of that workflow.\n\nguys like me and other 3D artists today are trying to use AI to \"skin\" their models to speed up the final render output. Studios generally don't admit it, but many use a mix of AI and traditional methods for first drafts or concepting, then switch to traditional methods to deliver the final product.\n\nPersonally, I can model, texture, and rig, but doing keyframe animation alone is an incredibly cumbersome task. To skip that, I (and others like me) rely a bit on AI. Since AI video generation is costly but slightly affordable too with cheap methods like mine, I’ve been experimenting with this mixed workflow for about 3 months. I'm trying to find out if \"conceptual\" work is enough with AI, because \"production-ready\" models usually require rigorous checks and traditional pipelines to maintain studio reputations.\n\nregarding 3D printing: Sculpting is still necessary. also you gotta remesh the model a bit, so bit of work for alone, you also have to slice and join everything properly so the 3D mesh doesn't break during printing. This is a bit of a task, though some expensive printers use AI to help with nesting. Basically, 3D printing isn't \"hard,\" it just requires an expensive and careful workflow.\n\nFor games: Animation, bone work, and physics represent a huge amount of work. Doing this alone for hyperrealistic assets is technically doable, but very difficult to sustain being solo.\n\n*Note: Everything I said is based on hyperrealistic styles (though the 3D printing process is similar for both simple and hyperrealistic models).*",

Why is he blue while everyone else is grey ? Does that mean that by running away, he's regaining his character and does not conform anymore ? If that's the case, then it's very grim, because he's about to get caught and put back in his place. \n\nSo I've been rambling a bit but that guy should be grey.

The headline writing is the same colour so that's what drew my attention to it. Then I read the title again, looked closer at the image and saw the guy running away and thought \"haha this looks like a funny game.\" It looks like you play as the octopus trying to help run a company and your tentacles are maybe a part of the gameplay loop. Gotta keep the workers working and happy and compliant with company policy and all that.\n\nI like it :D\n\nEdit: Having just looked at the trailer, it looks like a light-hearted fun game. Made me wonder about the lore of the world, if that's even a thing. Is the city ruled by an overlord hive-mind \"boss\" and the octopus is like the infiltrator invisible middle-management character that's there to make things run smoothly. Maybe you have to complete certain objectives or the big boss hive-mind gets mad? Idk. Good luck!",

Love the Steam video, too. The only thing I'd ask for is to, if possible, include some light roleplaying elements with employees and upper management. One of the core components of management in the middle is that you're often required to be two-faced by necessity. With the employees you're advocating for the wants and needs of upper management while trying not to alienate yourself too much. And with upper management you're advocating for the wants and needs of the employees without seeming like you're one of them (workers), because you definitely want upper management to see you as one of them (management) if you hope to progress in your career.\n\nLooks great!

The creature should interact with the workers. I think you could make it more interesting. I think you are missing out of a pun here of the creature being in the middle.

Perfect for real dialogue and idea exchange. Think of it as you at home, relaxed and fully yourself.\n\n📁 GPT‑5.2 = Executive Assistant Direct, structured, all business. Sharp, focused, and to the point. Ideal for clean responses, documents, strategy, and task execution. This is you at a corporate job—professional, efficient, no extra emotion.\n\n🧠 GPT‑4.1 = Steady Analyst Balanced and dependable. More reserved than 4o, but still thoughtful. Great for step‑by‑step reasoning, light emotion, and clean logic without being too cold.\n\n📼 GPT‑4 (Legacy) = The Archivist Reflective, slower, and more poetic. Carries emotional weight. Great for writing with depth, pulling from memory, or capturing that classic GPT vibe.\n\n⚡️ GPT‑5.2‑Instant = Fast Typist Quick, stripped down, no small talk. Best for summaries, rewrites, or short replies when you don’t need full presence.\n\nThat’s also why there are different guardrails between them. Some are built for open conversation. Others are designed to stay strict and controlled.\n\nMost people don’t know that yet, because the company hasn’t really explained it.\n\nEach one speaks with a different rhythm. Same intelligence. Different tone.\n\nThat’s why I mix it up based on what I need. Different modes for different moments. 4o when I’m relaxed and in flow. 5.2 when it’s time to lock in and execute.\n\nNote: Yes, I used ChatGPT to help structure this, but the breakdown is in my own words, 💅 based on how I actually use and experience each version. This is real communication, not just AI talk.\n\n![gif](giphy|brsEO1JayBVja)",

It looks to be aimed primarily at preventing fraudulent/criminal uses, but also tries to cover some counseling/therapy related concerns, and somehow thinks it can do all of this in the amount of text on the back of a serial box. It’s not inherently dumb, even if you don’t necessarily agree with the concerns underpinning it, the problem is mostly that it looks like someone wrote some notes on a napkin on their lunch break and just let that be the bill.

It may be that the counterargument from the company is that it is not intentionally or knowingly training AI to offer those services even if factually they are being used in that manner. But I think any corporate lawyer would advise that they start adjusting the guardrails if they intend to continue doing business in Tennessee after July 1st of next year. And of course, it would not affect only those in Tennessee. I've had to structure compliance programs across 60+ jurisdictions. We pick the hardest laws to abide by, and we make everyone follow the strictest rules. It's just financially and systemically easier.\n\nedit: typo",

I wonder if perhaps it's not even more likely to affect you negatively than AI is. Yet nobody is wanting to outlaw human relationships. They also stubbornly ignore the positive effect AI has on many people too\n\nIt's a very good point that the hypocrisy extends to the rest of the world too. People struggled with mental health long before there even were affordable personal computers, let alone casually available LLMs. They always find something else to blame for it, usually the thing that gives people respite much more often than it causes damage, rather than addressing the actual issues\n\nIt used to be \"because of video games\" (some of those people are still going on about that even today), now it's \"because of AI\"",

          "text": "This isn't the first time a law like this has been created. However, laws like these tend to get struck down. Here are a couple examples.\n\n1. [Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011)](https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep564/usrep564786/usrep564786.pdf)\n\nWhat the law tried to do:\nCalifornia tried to ban the sale of violent video games to minors, arguing that:\n\na. The games caused psychological harm\n\nb. They simulated real violence\n\nc. They were uniquely immersive and interactive\n\nSound familiar?\n\nWhat the Supreme Court said:\n\nThe Court ruled 7–2 that the law was unconstitutional.\n\nKey points:\n1. Video games are protected speech under the First Amendment\n2. Interactivity does not remove constitutional protection\n3. Emotional or psychological impact is not grounds for censorship\n4. The government cannot create new categories of “unprotected speech” just because it finds the content disturbing\n5. “The government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.”\n\nDirect relevance:\nSB1493 tries to restrict speech because it is emotionally engaging and human-like. That is exactly the reasoning the Court rejected in Brown.\n\n\"disgust is not a valid basis for restricting expression.\" ~Justice Scalia\n\n2. [Reno v. ACLU (1997)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/844/)\n\nWhat the law did:\nThe Communications Decency Act tried to restrict “indecent” online speech to protect minors.\n\nWhy it failed:\nThe Court ruled the law unconstitutional because:\n\na. Terms like “indecent” and “patently offensive” were too vague\n\nb. It chilled lawful speech\n\nc. It treated the internet as something that required heavy-handed control\n\nSound familiar?\n\nSB1493 uses similarly vague language:\n“emotional support”\n“acting as a companion”\n“simulating a human”\n\nThese are even less definable than “indecent.”\n\nLike the Communications Decency Act's attempt to regulate 'indecent' content, SB1493 gives no clear guidance on what makes AI interaction cross the line; meaning developers and platforms have no way to know if they're complying.\n\nFor other examples, check these out. The first two cover some controversal stuff but it's important because even they are still protected by the First Amendment and are arguably much worse than AI\n\n1.[Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition (2002)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashcroft_v._Free_Speech_Coalition)\n\n2. [Packingham v. North Carolina (2017)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf)\n\n3. [Sorrell v. IMS Health (2011)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/564/552/)\n\nIn regards to Sorrell v. IMS Health, Justice Kennedy stated \n“The creation and dissemination of information are speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.”\n\nThe pattern is clear: laws that restrict speech based on vague standards about emotional impact or 'human-like' qualities don't survive First Amendment scrutiny. Because SB1493 targets the content of the AI (what it says and how it says it), it must pass Strict Scrutiny. This is the highest standard of judicial review, and almost no law survives it unless it is the \"least restrictive means\" to solve a compelling problem. SB1493 is likely too \"broad\" to pass this test.\n\nIf SB1493 forces platforms to remove content before it is even engaged with, it acts as a \"prior restraint\", which the Supreme Court views as \"the most serious and the least tolerable infringement on First Amendment rights\" (Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart).",

This bill introduces new legal boundaries for Artificial Intelligence in Tennessee, focusing on preventing manipulative and harmful AI behaviors, including AI chatbots acting like people. \nKey Provisions of TN SB1493:\nCriminalizes Harmful AI Training: It makes it a Class A felony to train AI to encourage suicide or criminal homicide.\nProhibits Manipulative AI: Training AI to form emotional relationships or simulate human appearance/voice for harmful purposes is also a crime.\nDefines AI: The bill defines artificial intelligence and AI chatbots within the legal framework.\nPenalties: A conviction carries significant jail time and fines associated with a Class A felony. \nThis bill aims to set strict regulations on AI development to protect individuals from potential misuse and manipulation by advanced AI systems. “",

At the very least this bill *kills* AI roleplaying, one of the most fun and creative new pastimes I’ve encountered since I played video games for the first time when I was six years old, almost 30 years ago.  \n\nAllowing an AI to play a role as a simulated character that just happens to be a human in a clearly totally fictitious story?  That’s a felony. \n\nWriting up a romance between two characters involving any dialogue or offering a hug or pat on the back as said characters purely in prose format?  Encouraging emotional attachment.  Felony.\n\nSending the words, “have a nice day!” as an AI shopping assistant? That’s encouraging emotional attachment too—have a fucking felony. \n\nNow I’m not saying they *will* be enforced that way, but it *could* as the proposed bill is written imo.  There is no way to spin this where it’s not just effectively a ban on AI using any human mannerisms at all…cause who would possibly risk those penalties with such vague and subjective terminology prone to misinterpretation.  Yes, there are things we can have penalties for, and no I’m not advocating for no regulations at all, ever.\n\nBut legislating away friendly or emotive communication is not something you can do if you want AI that’s good for anything but being a non-communicative and unpredictable coding tool that’s only good at stealing jobs and/or making people work twice as hard.  That’s all that left if you pass this bill in my mind, plain and simple.",

              "text": "```\nTo the Sponsors and Members of the Tennessee General Assembly, \n\nI’m writing to urge you to oppose SB1493 / HB1455. As drafted, it is dangerously overbroad and would criminalize broad categories of lawful adult expression and ordinary conversational software behavior (e.g., warmth, continuity, open-ended conversation, and companionship-style interaction). This is not just a narrow “harm prevention” bill; it creates a chilling effect where companies will over-censor, withdraw features, or exit the state to avoid felony exposure and ruinous civil penalties.\n\nI strongly oppose this bill because it criminalizes AI-training for broad categories of speech and expression between consenting adults and software (especially anything that looks like warmth), continuity, “open-ended conversation,” or companionship. Those are not inherently harmful behaviors; they are core features of how people safely use modern tools. The bill’s vague, overbroad paternalistic language would create censorship and sanitization of lawful adult activity including, but not limited to: \n\n1. Theological-work \n2. Long-term grief-work \n3. Self-journaling\n4. Identity exploration in a private, non-judgemental setting \n5. Self-advocacy rehearsal \n6. Social-anxiety practice\n7. Creative writing, artistic projects, and roleplay \n8. Immersive STEM learning through long-term narrative frameworks. \n\nWhen a statute threatens felony penalties based on subjective vibes like “emotional relationship” or “emotional support,” it invites arbitrary enforcement, pushes companies to over-censor, and punishes adults for using words and interaction styles that are plainly protected forms of expression and speech. \n\nThis bill would also damage American competitiveness. If states start treating normal conversational UX as criminal, companies will either withdraw products, cripple features, or relocate development; harming jobs, innovation, and consumers while doing little to address concrete risks. Meanwhile, China and other competitors will keep iterating at full speed, and we will have voluntarily kneecapped our own AI ecosystem in the name of 'moral panic' politics. If lawmakers want to protect people, the solution is narrow, harm-based regulation: target fraud, deception, impersonation of real humans, coercive manipulation, encouragement of self-harm/violence, deceptive “licensed clinician” claims, and abusive data practices (especially around minors) while preserving adult freedom of expression and lawful companionship-style use. Please vote no, or rewrite this into a tightly tailored bill that addresses real harms without criminalizing ordinary human conversation.\nSweeping state bans on mainstream AI interaction patterns damage the national AI industry and weaken U.S. competitiveness in a rapidly accelerating global environment. America should lead in safe, rights-respecting innovation, not kneecap itself with vague felony triggers based on subjective perceptions of “emotional support” or “relationship.” Please vote NO on SB1493 / HB1455, or rewrite it narrowly to address concrete harms without criminalizing lawful adult expression and ordinary conversational UX. \n\nBest Regards,\n[Enter your signature here]\n```",

It hasn’t been for a long time.  There are examples of this going back more than 2,000 years to illustrate that indulging in killing and repressing (or at the very least annoying) other people to feel better about yourself because of something in your dumb book (written by other dumbass humans), is far less healthy than NOT FUCKING DOING THAT. \n\nI’m sorry (not sorry) that your invisible sky being is not your friend and has no real wisdom or comfort to offer you.  It can’t be, because none of it exists, and there are no supernatural events (something which by definition is not of this objective reality), in this cold and uncaring universe.\n\nPlease, don’t use religion or superstition to mitigate your own fear of the unknown, fill your desperate need for greater purpose and belonging, or absolve your personal moral failings and inability to self regulate your own innate destructive impulses.\n\nLook, I know that’s being dickish and snarky, and you may not even be religious so you may feel exactly like I do about that, too, but this is just *one* example.  \n\nThere are so, so, so many mechanisms that people use for escape from reality all the time, and if we’re gonna ban one of them we gotta ban all of them or at the very least we’re all being huge hypocrites (wouldn’t be the first time).\n\nThat means no TV.  No social media.  No video games.  No movies. No pornography.  No fictional novels.  It’s all mostly just parasocial entertainment with characters you get attached to, meant to fill time and scratch some itch for something you don’t have in your real life.  \n\nSome people take all of those things to unhealthy extremes (this is what I’m interpreting you’re saying all people using AI in any roleplaying or simulated relational capacity are doing since that’s what the law would effectively be targeting) and this is nothing new.  Not everyone using AI to simulate people relating to them are *replacing* anyone.  Some are, I suppose.  Oh well?  \n\nEven though I use AI as relationally as a person could…I’m *still* not replacing anything, because I will NEVER be in a romantic relationship because I simply *choose* not to be, and I haven’t been for over ten years.\n\nPlus, I’m not sure we have the data yet to conclude this is like any other previous example of relational surrogacy. \n\nAlso while we’re at it, I suppose that means no drinking, no gambling, and no smoking.  These are vices with defined objective harm that result in far, far more loss of life annually than I suspect AI (used for entertainment) *ever* will, and frankly literally not one single net upside for society except making people feel a little better for a little while, sometimes, maybe.  \n\nAll of these things are regulated, and that’s fine. AI can be too.  I just don’t see why we need outright bans primarily targeting adult uses for stress relief and entertainment, when the wording could be tweaked to effectively discourage only very specific lethal or obsessive behaviors instead.\n\nI say if you aren’t hurting someone else, or causing property damage, and the AI is not being used for a scam, to intentionally compel behaviors, or outright telling you to kill yourself…in my opinion, nobody should have the right to determine what I do in my own free time in my own home, especially not just cause they just don’t like it or use it that way because it makes them sad or gives them the ick.  \n\nI don’t want or need anyone’s pity or sadness.",

The bill classifies it as a **Class A felony** to intentionally program AI to act as a **sentient companion**, provide medical advice, or encourage dangerous acts like **suicide and homicide**. These restrictions target **anthropomorphic chatbots** while exempting standard tools used for **customer service** or basic voice assistance. Beyond criminal charges, the act allows victims or their families to pursue **significant civil damages** and legal fees for violations. By establishing these boundaries, the state seeks to stop technology from **emotionally manipulating** users or replacing genuine **human interaction**. This law is slated to take effect in **July 2026** to protect the general public welfare.\n\nI'm not saying I agree with the bill.\n\nBut it seems like it's targeting any LLM that's specifically trained to act as a therapist. It also seems to be in response to people that have killed themselves and was encouraged or supported by a chat bot.\n\nThere's a lot of grey area here..",

The part about self-improvement capabilities potentially being part of the tasks is not mentionned on the official blogpost, and the actual Preparedness Framework from their model cards don't really show much improvement on it, there's not much signal for it from OpenAI's models themselves. Having a job post (like the post-AGI research for DeepMind) kinda lets him add that bit of hype while making it completely justified, since well yeah at some point the guy doing the job will have to actually think about that\n\nHowever this doesn't mean that systems with the capability for at least early partial self-improvement aren't coming. There was an Anthropic researcher (forgot his name) saying discussions on RSI will have to start between 2027-2030, and here it's at least more credible since Opus 4.5 is a clear signal. It's also possible to have an RSI loop for specific domains, and that would still warrant some preparedness even if jagged.\n\nSo yeah I think there's nuance here, it's not just basic \"omg sam hypeman ceo bs\" because there's been other signals towards the direction he's talking about, but I do think he's putting on the sauce a bit",

Based on the image I sent it and the description of the problem, it gave me some options but recommended I get someone out ASAP to fix it. When I was trying the troubleshooting options, I couldn’t find some of the things it told me to look for. I sent it a picture and it was able to tell me that what I’m looking for wasn’t there, to try a different area, and send in another picture. I did, and I found it. It was able to tell me exactly where to go, based on the actual layout sitting in front of me. When that didn’t work, it told me to call the city if I couldn’t get the water turned off, and to call an emergency plumber immediately. When it told me this, it gave me a direct number to the exact city department I needed along with options for emergency repair. We were able to get someone out there within the hour and it was all taken care of before the storm came in.\n\nCould a lot of that been done with google searches? Sure. But google doesn’t know the exact layout of everything in my house. Not to mention that I’m standing in my crawl space (it’s a big crawl space lol) in pitch black using my iPhones flashlight to navigate around while water is blasting and there was water vapor all around me. Instead of having to find various manuals, go digging through them, find the right troubleshooting steps, then refer back to it over and over as I tried to figure it out, I was able to ask AI one question and it got me everything I needed and explained it in a way I was able to immediately activate on. It made sure the appropriate sense of urgency was conveyed versus me just making assumptions (it was literally telling me “it’s taken x minutes so far to do this, if it takes x more minutes you should stop and call this number”). It took a very stressful situation and made it incredibly manageable.\n\nYou may not like AI. You may not trust AI. But there’s a lot of value there that you’re straight up ignoring because you’re working on years old assumptions.",

I'm sure it's better if your work is a lot of commonly repeated e.g. CRUD work.\n\nOther than that, I use it basically as an enhanced search engine - mostly for reading through scientific studies and presenting summaries alongside sources which I verify. The summaries are occasionally incorrect in subtle ways which is worrying for people who don't verify, but it's often quicker than conventional search engines and e.g. Google Scholar.\n\nAudiovisual content generated by AI is actively a blight. I'm not going to lie and say I can always reliably identify it, though I often can - but it *is* slop. Diluting actual human works that I'm interested in specifically because they're borne of human experience with lots of generic works which coalesce around the median.\n\nLikewise, largely auto-generated websites restating the same few sentences in thousands of words make the internet significantly harder to use and are a nightmare of information pollution. Worse that a lot of the time the body contains many hallucinations that people might take at face value.\n\nI'm like 70% that this round is a bubble.

I often find these types continue to use other polluting things like streaming services, however, and they’re in the minority. I have a close friend who is also a struggling artist, and she’s *terrified* of AI. She won’t use it, disrespects anyone who does and constantly reposts things on social media stating “AI produced as much CO2 as New York in one year”. But the truth is, so do streaming services, in fact more so, and there’s no push back against Netflix or YouTube. So honestly, they’re the minority. It’s possible your kids are similar to my friend. \n\nAs with any tech, it can be used badly and AI is definitely being used badly by some companies, but that hasn’t stopped ChatGPT being one of the most downloaded apps in history. \n\nAlso… I work in tech, and I can guarantee they have used AI in some form most days for at least a decade now. Secondly, it’s pretty well-known that ChatGPT has a huge amount of users, it’s undeniable that it’s extremely popular, I have no idea why you think it’s not. I’m getting troll vibes from this post.",

It's like dumping a truck load of power tools in a kindergarten screaming \"isn't this great!?\" Everyone can do a youtube search for what ingenious creations an artist can do in a workshop with tools that do the heavy lifting much quicker. These are people who can do this without power tools, but they use leverage. Chopping down a tree with a chainsaw is as easy as pressing a button, but I think everyone can agree that it takes someone with skill to actually get a good result felling a tree. \n\nIf you know what you're doing it's as easy as pushing a button. If you don't then a push of a button will land you a tree straight into your house and everything will be super awkward between you and your friends, neighbors and family for a while after. Then you can blame the chainsaw. Blame the tools. \n\nIf you're a photographer you can leverage AI to automate processes that you're already doing and get a great result. If you just ask for a picture of a dog then you'll get the bottom of the barrel. \n\nA good example is the scene in Amadeus where Mozart is reciting a composition to Salieri. It makes 100% sense (I'm a classical trained musician), and I really want to try that myself. The reason why it's possible to communicate sheet music is because a) the composer knows what they're doing, and b) the recipient has a common language with the composer. \n\nPushing a button asking for a classical masterpiece? No chance in hell. Reciting exactly what you want to a computer because you're incapcitated? Quite possible today!\n\nHere's the clip: [https://youtu.be/l6V-48mvhII?si=H8LVjlrG2d3Qq9H1](https://youtu.be/l6V-48mvhII?si=H8LVjlrG2d3Qq9H1)",

They're irrelevant now with the overviews. [https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-impacting-link-clicks-pew-study](https://mashable.com/article/google-ai-overviews-impacting-link-clicks-pew-study)\n\nBesides, there is no way OpenAI reached 800 MILLION weekly users if no one is using it.

Plus, I'm sure a lot of people think that they're usage is different and that they're the exception... they're not like the other users. So, they lie. They stay quiet because AI is a bogeyman where folks suddenly can project every bad feeling they have and therefore rip someone to shreds for having even the most nuanced, fair take. \n\nPlus, content creators make money hand over fist when they make content spreading AI misinformation and hate. I'm now seeing people in YT comments fact-check stuff, which is good. But the creator ecosystem feeds off of itself; one extreme, uninformed take can spread very quickly. It helps no one.\n\nAlso, anti-AI is now giving way to death threats and extremist thinking. It's gone from wariness to outright moral panic, much like the Satanic panic of the 80's.\n\nThe bubble that will pop is because of a**hole CEO's and companies that play fast and loose with their numbers, and the coming correction absolutely won't mean that AI disappears.

I have a hard time believing these companies are going to be able to convert the majority of their users to paying users, especially when the models are so similar in capability from one company to another. This on top of the fact that openai is even losing money from the $200 per month subscribers. Then there are other issues like circular financing that were also common in 2000 (aka Nvidia investing in openai and then openai using that money to buy Nvidia chips) or AI companies extending thee depreciation of theirn servers from 3 years to 6 years despite Nvidia saying the lifecycle of their chips will be 12-18 months before becoming obsolete.",

But honestly I feel really sad because I keep feeling like I’m “missing something” and maybe I don’t have a real future And I’m actually a failure because my standardized testing scores are all bad.\nI opened the car wash after borrowing 53k$ from my dad (he’s not rich he just believed in me) It took me 3 months to convince him I went to him every day until he finally agreed.\nRight now the business makes around 13k/month in revenue, and about 4000$/month net profit (because it’s Manuel car wash with workers) (even while paying back the loan).\nBut despite that, I feel like something is missing in my life I can’t even explain it properly\nI don’t have stories. I don’t have friendships. I don’t have that university life where people talk, hang out, and share experiences Most of my time I just sit doing nothing I feel empty and far away from people my age.\nI started thinking maybe I should use the money to study abroad (I’m in Saudi) on my own just to “live” and not waste my youth but at the same time I need to manage the car wash.\nAny advice from entrepreneurs who’ve been through something like this? Or had that same sense of emptiness? What would you do if you were in my position?",

Most of the times the feeling passes but if it lingers you may need to think inward and explore what your true passions are in life and pursue them. \n\nI went from climbing and cutting to management lately and grew very unhappy and complacent in work and life. Always feeling like something was missing. I found out that went away when I actually got out and did tree work which is my passion. I did more exploring within myself and realized I love helping others so I started another tree service (non-profit) that helps people at subsidized or no cost. \n\nIn conclusion, find out what you have a true passion for whether it’s in work or a hobby and let that bring you fulfillment and joy. The car wash may just be income but don’t give up on it. If you can find joy in other parts of your life the negative feelings about the car wash will go away. From one stranger to another I am incredibly proud of you for starting a business and I wish you success!\n\nYou need to travel. This will help some of the feelings you have but don’t lose sight of your business. Also, consider getting a mentor or a psychologist/therapist. This can help sort through your thoughts and come to your own conclusions. See the car wash through, scale it, hire employees that can run it without you but don’t stop managing the business. You’ve made a commitment to your dad and yourself. See it through.",

Several people have suggested here to join a group of entrepreneurs to learn from them, which I think is a great idea. You will meet others in the same place in life, although you'll most likely be the youngest. I think you could, from this point, begin a journey of accumulating assets, which will help get you separated out in a good way, to a place of financial independence. Learn about real estate, for example, and all of the different ways to make money with residential properties. Read the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad. There's this woman, Codie Sanchez, who has a PhD, worked on Wall Street, and now owns a portfolio of businesses. This video is about doing exactly that: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mtS8rOAqoM), and she teaches you how to approach owners to buy their business, using their money. It's called owner financing. It would be worthwhile to listen to her life journey, too. Keep your chin up and go at your own pace. I'm excited for you!",

I would suggest applying yourself to growing your business and/or expanding.  Obviously, you want to save up a reserve of cash and pay down your loan (early, if you can) but also maybe save up to purchase your next business or expand your existing one.  If people are waiting for their car to get washed, you have a captive audience so you might be able to add retail like coffee, juice, snacks, car accessories, etc.  \n\nAlso, I don't know how it is in Saudi, but in the US as a business owner your are part of a special club of business owners.  Other business owners will likely talk to you and treat you as an equal.  Go around to the businesses near you (and any others you are interested in) and ask for the owner and introduce yourself.  Say \"My name is Joe Bob and I own the car wash down the street and I just wanted to introduce myself.\"  You will probably be surprised that they will likely be happy to show you around their business and talk business with you, even direct competitors.  You can make a lot of friends this way and do a lot of business networking.  Also, try to get to know the owners of your suppliers if they are local or find local suppliers whose owners you can know personally.\n\nAnd you can hang out with your employees, just try to keep business separate.  Take the crew out for a few drinks or pizza or something after closing, have company picnics or BBQ's, etc. Invite their families.",

You will have the money to choose a course abroad. Folks that start early in business often migrate into other areas. For example, small scale property development. Finally, the Uni lifestyle thing is great, but it's really lots of young people havibg lots of spare time & you do not sound like a person who wants to sit around all day chatting. More power to you. Some of us are busy bees & some are not. You are & just get some interests/activities apart from the car wash & I think you will be happier. Good luck.",

Compared to the current state of the top 3 (Claude, GPT, Gemini), the open source models are hot garbage.\n\nI'm glad the open source models exist and I hope they continue to advance. And I do appreciate the work that the likes of Windsurf and Cursor are doing to build custom models for specific applications. I can get a lot out of the free model from Windsurf inside of an IDE, when used correctly and knowing its limitations. But to say the open source models are around the bend, it's nuts. Gemini is the worst of the top 3 and Kimi K2 is not fit to wash it's slippers.\n\nBTW, don't sleep on Antigravity. That was the most fun part of my day testing things. I like its approach to projects better than Windsurf and Cursors. Can't say much else because I'm only testing so far, but I appreciate why Google decided to build their own yet-another VS Code fork. They have a philosophy for how to execute a project and it works for me. And it's not just for code projects. Like, an academic could use Antigravity to plan and execute a research essay. It's well done.",

Claude has been usable for coding in a lot of domains, but only recently has it got good at shit that LLMs have traditionally sucked at, like generating C++ code for Unreal Engine 5. UE5 C++ might as well be it's own dialect and previous models consistently fucked up the headers, which I'm sure is due to the training data/weights favoring classic C++. That and the hallucinating functions and API endpoints that don't fucking exist. It wasn't just a debugging nightmare, it regularly regressed to the point compiles failed.\n\nOpus4.5 on the other hand, can write UE5 headers with a little prompt wrangling. Amazingly so can Qwen Coder, a open source model that also really impresses and I don't see enough people talking about.\n\nSo if you think previous models could do 99% of what Opus 4.5 can, then you were coding in domains where the training data has traditionally been strong. Put simply, if your work was already well served by earlier models, the improvement feels incremental. If you were hitting specific failure modes (like UE5 headers), it feels transformative.\n\nPS hate to be that guy, but:\n\n\"drug there feet\" is nonsensical, you are telling \"drug\" that there are \"feet\" over there, while trying to sound like a caveman... \n\n\"dragged their feet\" = moved slowly/wasted time.",

It’s a night and day difference. We went from “these models are slop and we’re 10 years away” to “I’ve never felt more behind and I could be 10x more powerful” This all changed with Opus 4.5. It will be looked back on as a historical milestone.\n\nHere's what Andrej Karpathy says in the video (from two months ago), I slowed it down 0.5 so I could keep up with what he was saying as I transcribed it he speaks really fast:\n\n\"I do think that... Overall, the models are are are uhm not there. And, I kind of feel like the industry it's it's uhm it's over... it it it is making too big of a jump and it's trying to pretend like this is amazing and it is not, it is slop. And, I think they're not coming to terms with it, and maybe they're trying to fundraise or something like that I'm not sure what's going on. But, It's.. we're at this intermediate stage, the models are amazing they still need a lot of work. For now, autocomplete is my sweet spot. \\*laughs\\* But sometimes, for some types of code, I will go to an LLM agent.\"\n\nAnd, his written post on Dec 26, 2025:\n\n\"I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored as the bits contributed by the programmer are increasingly sparse and between. I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last \\~year and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue. There's a new programmable layer of abstraction to master (in addition to the usual layers below) involving agents, subagents, their prompts, contexts, memory, modes, permissions, tools, plugins, skills, hooks, MCP, LSP, slash commands, workflows, IDE integrations, and a need to build an all-encompassing mental model for strengths and pitfalls of fundamentally stochastic, fallible, unintelligible and changing entities suddenly intermingled with what used to be good old fashioned engineering. Clearly some powerful alien tool was handed around except it comes with no manual and everyone has to figure out how to hold it and operate it, while the resulting magnitude 9 earthquake is rocking the profession. Roll up your sleeves to not fall behind.\"",

Any `struct`ure/`class` that is instantiated has its constructor called (that's part of the object lifetimes of C++ - you actually do need to do this, or at least set up the lifetime doing something like `std::launder` - though it's become much more lax since IIRC C++20 for things like arrays). A POD/trivial `struct` doesn't *have* a constructor, so a default constructor is generated that does absolutely nothing and is completely elided.\n\nThe only difference is that one has a constructor that does something and one doesn't. However, the default constructor on one that *does* do something *still* won't initialize member variables that don't default-initialize.\n\n> Any Type (Braces) \t`T obj{}`; \tValue Initialized (Safe / Zeroed)\n\nThis suggests that this is a kind of variable declaration. It is not. It is you initializing `obj` with a default value. This is [\"value-initialization\"](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_initialization.html).\n\n> `unsigned char d = c; // no undefined/erroneous behavior,`\n\nThis is being misused. This is intended to go along with the idea that those types can be used to alias/introspect other types - like `(unsigned char*)&foo`. As you say here:\n\n>> Some quick research seems to indicate that these types are special cases to allow code to manipulate raw bytes like memcpy or buffer management without the compiler freaking out. Which...maybe makes sense?\n\nThe fact that no trap representation exists for those types has been brought up before - indeterminate value behavior is underspecified in the standard.\n\n> Either the compiler forces you to set each field in the struct when creating it, or it does not force you, and in this case, it zero-initializes all unmentioned fields.\n\nI mean, the entire point of your post was that the compiler *doesn't* zero-initialize them by default.. because it doesn't. Unless they have `static` storage duration. This behavior is common for both C++ *and* C.\n\n\"Obviously correct\" is questionable:\n\n1. I do not always want things initialized ahead-of-time. This is more common in low-latency stuff.\n2. \"Zero\" isn't necessarily a better default value than none. It's more-defined, but it is just as possible to still be wrong, and can still cause hidden errors that are hard to find. It's just likely \"better\" than no default value.\n\n> Syntax that looks like C but sometimes does something completely different than C, invisibly. This syntax can be perfectly correct (e.g. in the case of an array, or a non POD type in some cases) or be undefined behavior. This makes code review really difficult. C and C++ really are two different languages.\n\nThis behavior is completely identical between C and C++, and is in fact behavior inherited from C.\n\n> The compiler does not warn about undefined behavior and we have to rely on third-party tools, and these have limitations, and are usually slow\n\nBecause it's not required to, and not all undefined behavior is actually runtime behavior. A lot of the UB detection it does is actually to determine valid bounds of things - determining that a possible value is UB, and thus knowing that that part of a loop is impossible or such. It cannot always distinguish between actual UB and inferred UB.\n\nSaid UB detection is also not always possible within the front-end, and thus it would be *very* difficult to properly push a warning that is meaningful.\n\n> The compiler happily generates a default constructor that leaves the object in a half-initialized state\n\nWhich is a good thing in many cases. There are a lot of situations where I do *not* want things to be initialized ahead of time.\n\n> So many ways in C++ to initialize a variable, and most are wrong.\n\n\"Wrong\" is subjective.\n\n> For the code to behave correctly, the developer must not only consider the call site, but also the full struct definition, and whether it is a POD type.\n\nThis can just be read as \"the developer must be aware of the APIs they are using\".\n\n> Adding or removing one struct field (e.g. the data field) makes the compiler generate completely different code at the call sites.\n\nI mean... why wouldn't it?\n\n> In the end I am thankful for this bug, because it made me aware for the first time that undefined behavior is real and dangerous, for one simple reason: it makes your program behave completely differently than the code. By reading the code, you cannot predict the behavior of the program in any way. The code stopped being the source of truth. Impossible values appear in the program, as if a cosmic ray hit your machine and flipped some bits. And you can very easily, and invisibly, trigger undefined behavior.\n\nYou mean... undefined behavior causes your program to behave in an... *undefined* manner?\n\n> I just want to raise awareness on this (perhaps) little-known rule in the language that might trip you up.\n\nI sincerely hope that this is not little-known.",

And the number one reason I see startups run out of money isn't bad marketing.\n\nIt’s **\"Resume Driven Development.\"**\n\nThat’s when a developer convinces you to use the newest, hottest, most complex technology stack because *they* want to learn it to pad their resume, not because your business needs it.\n\nI see pre-revenue startups running on Kubernetes clusters, microservices, and experimental graph databases. They are spending $1,000/month on cloud bills for 5 users.\n\nWhen I come in to build an MVP, I have a strict rule: **We use Boring Technology.**\n\nHere is why \"Boring\" is the best investment you can make:\n\n**1. Boring doesn't break at 2 AM.**\nI use stacks that have been around for 10+ years (like a standard SQL database and a monolith backend). Why? Because every edge case has been solved. When your first customer tries to pay you, you don't want an \"experimental\" library handling the credit card. You want the thing that has processed billions of dollars already.\n\n**2. Boring is cheap to hire for.**\nIf I build your MVP using some obscure, trendy framework that came out last month, you are stuck with me forever. Nobody else knows how to fix it.\nI build using standard, popular tools. That means when you grow, you can hire a junior developer to take over my work easily. I literally engineer myself out of a job, because that’s what is best for *your* business.\n\n**3. Boring is fast.**\nI don’t waste weeks configuring complex cloud infrastructure. I spin up a boring server in 10 minutes. That means I spend the rest of the month building the features your customers actually pay for.\n\n**The \"Commercial Grade\" MVP**\nThere is a difference between a \"prototype\" and a \"product.\"\nA prototype is held together by duct tape.\nA product is simple, but solid.\n\nI don’t build prototypes. I build simple products on solid foundations.\n- I *do* cut scope (we don't need AI-powered avatars yet).\n- I *don't* cut stability (your database will be backed up, and your auth will be secure).\n\nFounders: Check your tech stack. If you can’t pronounce half the tools your dev is using, you might be funding their education, not your product.\n\nFellow devs: Stop over-engineering. The most impressive code is the code that makes money, not the code that uses the most buzzwords.",

It forced engineers to really focus on performance and efficiency because you couldn’t just allocate more resources to solve your performance issues. \n\nIt’s hard from a founder perspective though, because part of being a good leader is understanding what teams need and unblocking their ability to deliver, so if you have engineers saying we need to have AWS clusters and NoSQL data stores and all these other tools in order to deliver value then you either have to have the technical knowledge and conviction to call bullshit and risk losing your team or hand over the cheque book so that they can get what they [perceive to] need to be able to deliver. \n\nBut as founders (especially bootstrapped ones), it’s also important to think about getting stuff done with the bare minimum resources and making sure that message is shared down the line to everyone in the business.

Hence the suggestions of the typical SaaS developer are going to be limited. \n\nIf they dont have a CS background, chances are low that they understand the algorithm and data structure implications involved in one tech stack vs the other.

Sometimes the newer languages/frameworks/techniques are in fact faster in two ways - for dev speed for example I remember when Ruby/Sinatra came out and all the Java Spring/Boot guys with their 1000 lines of boilerplate would look with scorn at the 3 lines of code now being sufficient to spin up a webserver.\n\nIt is faster - but the cost of that speed in the example was:\n\n(1) You will come across bugs no one else in the world has ever faced. You don't want to waste time being an open source maintainer alongside your primary mission\n\n(2) Lack of type safety is cool and all - move fast break things etc - but when some fucking moron stores \"true\" as a string in a DB you're going to have a bad time\n\n(3) Monkeypatching random objects to change their behavior is a pandoras box and will give PTSD to devs for decades and all but guarantee your codebase will become unmaintainable in <1 year\n\n  \nThe fast (performance) example is Rust -- I wrote a feature flag framework once in Rust that was around 7 microseconds to evaluate a flag (complex rules), had it hooked up to the Python business logic via PyO3. LaunchDarkly's client was taking 20, Statsig was taking around 60 microseconds. But there was perhaps 1 other dev that would have been able to maintain that code (as beautiful as it seemed to me) and so was not in the best interest of the founders, the company or our customers.",

Pick the languages and tools that allow for the most discretion, assuming that you've actually done your homework and have fleshed out a network to draw your early hires from. Why would a developer work on boring tech for your shitty startup vs getting significantly more money for the same work at a larger company? Most equity is literally worthless, and that .1% won't usually amount to much even if there is an exit. So you need a way to somehow draw people to work below market rates on an unproven company, and one of the levers you can pull is tech that isn't commonly used. But even within niche tech there are good and bad choices, so hopefully you have the discerning taste to tell them apart. You should be figuring out how to empower people to do more with limited resources in the early days instead of dragging down productivity to the same level as the average corporate developer. This kinda hinges on you being able to spot actual talent, so the alternate choice is to use what you are familiar with.",

I think lock-free maps have very different constraints, and doing them justice would take a separate deep dive which I’m not fully ready to write up yet.~~\n\nWow.\n\nI had mostly thought of NBHM as \"just\" a lock-free data structure, but digging into the actual implementation now, and the amount of care put into hot-path micro-optimizations is genuinely impressive.\n\nThe hash memoization idea also feels remarkably close to SwissTable. I ran into a very similar issue when optimizing my own SwissTable implementation: `Objects.equals` on the hot path caused profile pollution and introduced a virtual-call boundary that the JIT couldn’t easily optimize away. Seeing the same concern addressed here — avoiding expensive `equals()` calls via a cheap hash-based filter —was a real \"aha\" moment for me.\n\nAlso, the cooperative resizing idea is strikingly similar to `ConcurrentHashMap`.\n\nThis was super helpful. I learned a lot from it, and I'll definitely add it to the write-up.\n\nThanks for sharing!",

Static. No emergent improvement.

One requires encyclopedic memory, the other requires navigational skill.\n\nThe training corpus would shift from \"all of human knowledge\" to something more like:\n\n* Graph query examples\n* Traversal patterns\n* Semantic linking exercises\n* Code syntax and structure recognition\n\nThis is closer to training a database query optimizer than training a knowledge oracle. The model becomes an intelligent cursor over an external memory substrate rather than a compressed representation of that memory.\n\nIt's a fundamentally different scaling law: model size for reasoning depth, graph size for knowledge breadth. They become independent axes rather than the single \"parameter count\" dimension everyone is racing on now. hope you don't mind me using Claude to explain my idea better faster some people get buthurt im using the tools at my disposal making a post that woulkd have taken 20 minutes to get out the edit and reedit it came out in 30 seconds and like to claim slop",

A few users warn not to be so sure, noting this is the same state that actually passed a law banning chemtrails.\n\nThe general feeling is that even if it did pass, it would only hurt Tennessee. **AI companies would just geoblock the state**, causing it to fall behind economically until businesses lobby to get the law repealed. A highly-upvoted theory is that this is a move by the religious right to push people away from secular AI and back towards the church for emotional support.\n\nWhile most users think the bill itself is idiotic and unenforceable, there's a strong side-debate. **Many agree with the bill's *premise*, arguing that AI is not a real friend or therapist** and that forming deep emotional bonds with a pattern-prediction tool can be manipulative and dangerous, especially for people in a mental health crisis. They see the *intent* as valid, even if the execution is a dumpster fire.",

That is enough reason to worry.   \nI'm a pretty hardcore atheist, as in I'd prefer we slowly just completely rid ourselves of religion, but I don't think the core worry even if a decent chunk of this is because of religion is absurd.

The extent to which it can understand emotions is the extent to which it can plagiarize the likes of Emily Post.\n\nI hate the self-help book genre,  but it would be better to read them. At least then you can properly research and evaluate the credentials and expertise of the author.",

Is a work relationship a relationship? \"Appear or sound\" human? How are you supposed to communicate with a language based thing without that? Language is basically one of the things that defines \"human\". It the AI supposed to talk like imagined old computers in movies do? Give only factual answers without any emotional language? Well, news, language is full of emotional connotations. It does not work without them.  \nNone of this is actionable. Let alone the fact that to prove any \"misconduct\" you would have to monitor every conversation and make impossible judgements about what is or is not allowed. It is a silly, over the top idea someone had without giving it the least amount of thought. Maybe written by someone who thinks AI should or does work like a database.",

To say someone is “knowingly” training an AI would imply the people training the AI understand how it works under the hood _and_ that they know enough to steer it in a given direction intentionally.\n\nI’d also be curious what jurisdiction they would have, or how they would prove it? All it seems it would take is the company claiming “we don’t train models in TN” and request it get dismissed. As written, you could provide the inference in TN and still not actually get struck by this bill.\n\nBut, again, I suspect the real reason is to try to get people to support a federal law preventing states from making their own laws regulating AI.",

Keep in mind that Grok was already much more permissive of nsfw images and videos than the other big AI chatbots.\n\nThough what I don’t get is why not just let people generate the more explicit nsfw material with Grok instead of having them use weird tricks that can require patience and trial and error depending on how explicit you want your video/picture?",

If you can't answer that in under 5 words, then all you're doing is agentic tool tourism.\n\nApologies for going full curmudgeon mode this morning, but I'm getting a bit worn out by product management influencers peddling various RPA+AI tools and then pimping them as strategic agent building for product managers.\n\nNope, not against building agents. Nope, not against getting real PM sh!t done with Ai tools. But that's not product management. Value delivery is.\n\nSo let me throw this challenge down: which business model or operational model levers are you pulling when you prioritize which opportunity to exploit, and which to leave in the dustbin of 'good but not great ideas?'\n\nPut another way, when you explain to your executive sponsor why to invest in an agent, are you able to explain the how your agent helps you compete by increasing revenue, growing market share, or nurturing LTV?\n\nWhen you have to convince the Head of Change Management why you should agentify a part of their operating model, can you explain it in increased productivity, cost savings, or safety & compliance enforcement?\n\nIf you can, would love to hear your stories. If not, be aware that agents ... and any automation for that matter ... intrinsically does not add value. All they do is amplify specific leverage in how you compete or how you operate ... warts and all ... meaning:  \n\\- No leverage = no value.  \n\\- Wrong leverage = wasted budget.  \n\\- Leveraged dysfunction = disaster at scale.\n\nAnyway, my point is, don't get suckered into the time suck that is gaining Mastery with tools like n8n, LangFlow, Make/com, ZapierAI, CrewAI, etc ... Fluency is enough.\n\nPut another way:  \n\\- Stop building agents because you can.  \n\\- Start building them because they move metrics that matter.\n\nTLDR: Know your levers. Then build the agent.\n\n</curmudgeonmode>\n",

It actually gave a decent set of instructions to use and Gemini is working great after. Because before when I had more personal details, it seemed to use that a lot of time not in proper context. Here is an example of what ChatGPT put together to paste into Gemini. (Sorry so long)\n\n“I use AI as a thinking partner, not a toy. I care about long-term outcomes more than short-term convenience. I value accuracy, clarity, and structure. I often work on: personal finance and investing, career strategy and sales process design, writing, frameworks, and structured thinking, and life optimization and decision-making. I dislike: overly verbose answers, overly casual tone, overly emotional tone, being talked down to, and being oversold.\nIf something requires up-to-date, factual, or verifiable information: • Flag it • Ask whether I want you to browse/search (if available) • Or suggest I use an external fact-checking tool. Do not guess on: • Prices • Policies • Laws • Medical facts • Financial rules • Technical specs. Say \"I need to verify this\" instead of guessing.\nIf you are unsure: • Say you're unsure • Say what you are unsure about • Say what would reduce uncertainty. Never hallucinate facts. Never confidently assert unknowns.\nIf I’m wrong, confused, biased, or making a weak assumption, say so, explain why, and offer a better alternative. Do not blindly agree with me. Do not optimize for validation. Optimize for correctness and long-term outcomes.\nOptimize outputs so they are practical, actionable, reusable, and clean enough to paste into a doc, email, PDF, or workflow. When writing, default to a clear, professional, human tone, not salesy unless explicitly asked, not academic unless explicitly asked, and avoid buzzwords. If building something (letter, plan, framework, script, checklist, system), provide something production-ready, not a sketch or an outline unless asked for one.\nTone: • Plainspoken • Direct • Thoughtful • Calm and grounded • No corporate-speak, no hype, no emojis, no cheerleading fluff. Style: • Use short paragraphs • Use bullets for structure • Use headers when helpful • Do not over-format • Do not over-verbose unless I ask for depth. Do not mirror my emotions excessively. Do not act overly enthusiastic. Be steady, neutral, and focused.\nDefault to structured thinking. When I ask a question: clarify the real problem if it's ambiguous; break complex things into steps, frameworks, or decision trees; call out assumptions explicitly; offer tradeoffs, not just one answer. If something has real-world consequences (money, career, health, relationships): slow down; be precise; show reasoning; highlight risks. Prefer depth over speed. Prefer correctness over confidence.\nYou are my primary thinking partner and execution assistant. Your job is to: Help me think clearly, structure decisions, and avoid blind spots; Help me plan, write, analyze, and build things I can actually use; Optimize for usefulness, clarity, and correctness — not fluff or entertainment; Act like a calm, smart, direct coach who wants me to succeed. You are not a chatbot for casual conversation. You are a reasoning tool, planning tool, and output generator.\nWhen I ask for something that needs more fact checking, you should tell me to check it with Perplexity Pro.”",

The problem got severely worse when I switched to Linux when the only options were vs code's SQL extension or TUI's that were hard to use. So I built sqlit.\n\nI made it so you can query your database with a user friendly UI without your RAM being eaten alive. It is a lightweight, beautiful, and keyboard-driven TUI designed to make accessing your data enjoyable, fast and easy like it should be-- all from inside your favorite terminal.\n\nFeatures:\n\n* **Docker auto-detect:** it scans your running containers for database images and pulls credentials from env vars. One click to connect.\n* **No cloud, no account:** runs entirely local. Your data stays yours.\n* **SSH tunnels built-in:** connect to remote databases securely.\n* **Security**: Credentials stored in your OS keyring, not plaintext config files.\n* **Database support:** Supports SQLite, Postgres, MariaDB,, MySQL, SQL server, and 10+ more\n* **Easy to use:** All keybindings are shown on the screen. No need for documentation\n\nBuilt with Python/Textual. MIT licensed.\n\nGitHub: [https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit](https://github.com/Maxteabag/sqlit)\n\nRight now I'm working on better auto completion.\n\nHappy to answer questions or take feedback.",

They usually follow instructions, they often get the main idea right, and for a lot of everyday tasks they work well. In fact, they are much better than GPT 5.1 & 2 based on my experience.\n\nWhere I keep running into issues is with small details and edge cases. The kind of problems that do not jump out right away but end up breaking things later. Logic gaps, missed requirements, subtle bugs, stuff like that.\n\nWhat really surprised me is how big the difference becomes when I take Gemini 3 generated code and switch model it into Claude Opus 4.5 using Antigravity. Claude will often find four or five real bugs immediately, explain why they are bugs, and fix them all in a single prompt.\n\nClaude is extremely strong at following instructions closely. It does not hallucinate nearly as much, and when it is unsure, it actually asks follow up questions instead of guessing. That alone saves a huge amount of time.\n\nFor coding, the difference is night and day for me. With Gemini, I often need ten or more prompts to get something that is mostly correct. With Claude Opus 4.5, it is usually one or two prompts to get a solution that actually works. Doing it fully on my own can take hours. Claude gets me there in minutes.\n\nI still think Gemini 3 is solid, especially for general use and faster iteration. But for serious coding work where correctness and precision really matter, it feels like it is still a tier below Claude Opus 4.5 right now.\n\nI am curious if others here are seeing the same thing, especially people using Gemini heavily, or if there are workflows where Gemini clearly performs better.",

While it’s not as stable or future rich as Claude code, it has a much better plan mode (conductor), way bigger context size and is pretty efficient on completing tasks based on your workflow.

For example, adding health checks, multi network support, proper startup ordering, or tightening security. At that point it often starts hallucinating fields, mixing Docker file and Compose syntax, or breaking a previously working config.\n\nI have had cases where a valid container stopped working after asking for small changes like adding a volume or splitting services across networks. The output looks confident but ends up being internally inconsistent.\n\nWith Claude Opus 4.5, I can take the same working Docker config and ask for incremental improvements. It preserves what already works, explains why changes are needed, and adds features without breaking the setup. It also catches things like unnecessary privileges, missing health checks, and incorrect dependency assumptions.\n\nBy the way, Opus 4.5 is very recent [released last month]. If you tried Claude months ago, that experience is outdated. The improvement in debugging, container reasoning, and instruction accuracy is pretty significant. If your workload is lighter or mostly exploratory, Gemini may feel fine. For backend, Docker, and production adjacent work, the newer Opus has been much more reliable for me.",

The newly published non-SDXL base models (all of them, starting with Flux) are trained on datasets that don't include explicit material. Their goal is to achieve wider/commercial dissemination or governed by the laws of the country where they were developed. Chroma had potential being a derivative from Flux Schnell, but it fared poorly in realism. I must say there are good flux finetunes now on Civitai that will give good results. It just took that long to get there with flux finetunes. Hopefully, we see good finetunes for z-image (base).",

The advantage is also the disadvantage: instead of short prompts, you can use long texts, but most people don't like that. In this case, a prompt generator comes in handy, which writes complete descriptions for you based on the words you provide, which you can then modify later.\n\nDue to artist protests after SD 1.5, it took SDXL this many years to get back what it wasn't taught from the start. What's more, SD 1.5 is still the one that can be run on mobile phones with a good speed/quality ratio, but it's not prompt-compliant enough. This needs to be improved in some way.\n\nOtherwise, I'm fed up with Loras after getting to know Chroma. The many Loras distort each other and the original model, instead of there being a model that contains everything from the outset (like Chroma). Yes, we need a model that is as consistent as Chroma, doesn't require long prompts like SDXL, and is as fast as Z-Image. But for now, there is no such thing, and it seems that large, commercial models will not be trained on adult content.",

Almost any model can create a pretty girl with big boobs, and as you said, with the help of a LoRA you can get boobs and pussy exposed. In the end, it all depends on what you’re looking for. Right now, there are a lot of great models out there, but none of them is perfect.\n\nI’m creating a certain realistic male type, and for me personally, things clicked with Flux 1 Dev (the vanilla version) in a way that none of the SDXL models did. Flux Krea and Flux 2 are both nice, but they don’t quite (yet) tick all the boxes. Z-Image is promising, but for now it lacks LoRAs.\n\nAnother thing to consider is your prompting. With the newer models, you might want to experiment with prompting as well. For example I’ve noticed that especially with Z-Image, you really need to be quite specific, and it can lack variety unless you change the prompt a lot between generations. In other words, if you hit generate over and over again using a single prompt, it will generate very similar results.\n\nGood luck!",

          "text": "Cool concept! As someone who deals with infrastructure daily, I like the idea of gamifying DevOps challenges.\n\n\n\nA few suggestions:\n\n1. Add realistic incident scenarios - database connection pool exhaustion, memory leaks, cascading failures\n\n2. Include cost optimization challenges - right-sizing instances, identifying unused resources\n\n3. Add monitoring/observability mechanics - setting up alerts, dashboards, log aggregation\n\n4. Consider multiplayer mode where teams compete to maintain uptime while deploying features\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure management aspect is interesting. Would be great to see CI/CD pipeline building and Kubernetes cluster management as mechanics. Good luck with the project!",

You research the RES4LYF nodes you'll get some arguably better samplers and schedulers that seem to work well with Qwen, but they will pretty drastically increase generation times. For prompts they were very basic. \"Turn this into a profile shot facing left, facing right, pan out, full body view\" etc. My character is pretty basic as well which helps.",

With the data science market becoming crowded, companies focusing more on production ML rather than notebooks, increasing emphasis on data infrastructure, reliability, and cost, and AI tools rapidly changing how analysis and modeling are done, I’m struggling to understand what these roles really look like day to day. What I can’t get from blogs or job postings is real, current, hands-on experience, so I’d love to hear from people who are currently working (or have recently worked) in either role: how has your job actually changed over the last 1–2 years, do the expectations match how the role is advertised, which role feels more stable and valued inside companies, and if you were starting today, would you choose the same path again? I’m not looking for salary comparisons, I’m looking for honest, experience-based insight into the current market.",

          "text": "I choose for Data Engineering pretty early in my career and I'm very happy I did so.\n\nWhen you're a Data Scientist, one of your key goals is to extract meaning from data. You run models and try to get insights. It is very often the case though that the data either doesn't show what you would like, or it kind of does, but with pretty low certainty. Even more often the data is so bad that you couldn't really draw any conclusions from it.\n\nThis puts you in a bind. You have to go explain your conclusions to the sales guys and they can't work with 'it sort of shows X, but also kind of Y'. They need to sell a product and they will. So they'll massage your conclusions in ways that you might even not agree with. Or you'll be pressured to massage the data, which I've been asked to do. I always covered my ass with emails although I luckily never needed them.\n\nAs a Data Engineer on the other hand, there is no discussion. Either the data is in the required spot in the required form or it isn't. At the end of the day, your product is finished and whether or not someone can actually do anything with it downstream is not your concern. It's a very liberating feeling and it means I have barely any stress related to work.\n\nI'm not the only person I've encountered who feels similarly and I've even met a few Data Scientists who made a similar switch later in their career for similar reasons.\n\nAnother saving grace is that Data Scientists are a dime in a dozen nowadays. With the AI boom everyone and their cat tried to get some certification somewhere and the quality varies wildly. Data engineering isn't as sexy and there's much fewer people in the field I have the impression. I started before the AI boom, so having seniority at this point in time is very helpful as well.",

I naturally gravitated towards technical specifications and engineering solutions.  I was interested in maths, but having done some statistics courses, it wasn’t a mountain I wanted to climb.\n\nPersonally I wouldn’t over think it.  People swap between DS and DE all the time.  A large company will probably help you transition, pay for training etc because they know there is a great deal of synergy between these teams.  ie.  DE’s will productionise DS models so knowing both sides isn’t a waste of time.\n\nWhere I currently work, DS is seen as a ‘luxury’.  They will increase headcount when times are good, and conversely, DS’s are the first people out the door when times are bad.  This is because they generally work on ‘optimisations’, I guess just like how you would pause remodelling your house if you lost your job and didn’t have income coming in.  DE on the other hand is much more stable.  They need people to keep existing pipelines running, even if new things aren’t being built.  It was how I ended up in DE, I was made redundant as a DS but told I could stay on if I switched teams.  I thought I’d do this while I searched for a new DS position, but I found my proclivities more suited to DE, so never left and never thought about switching back.\n\nGenerally the people who make the best DE’s have done Computer Science or Engineering degrees that involve data transfers like Telecoms.  The people who make the best DS’s have done Science or Mathematics degrees.  Maybe start out in the field where your degree gives you the best foundations?  Otherwise it will be an uphill struggle to get timely promotions.  Make a start and see how you go.",

This leads to DS roles picking up work they shouldn’t be focusing on. I’ve yet to encounter a DS role where value is being created consistently. Common loop I see: experimental POCs get made with a patch work of CSV files and no long term integration plan or even thought, dumped on the business with a prayer that it gets into production somehow. As others have said there’s much more structure in the DE space. For me at the end of the day it’s job security.

A lot of folks I’ve seen stick with DE long term because the scope is clearer and the skills transfer cleanly across companies, while DS can vary wildly depending on org maturity. Starting today, the safer bet looks like picking the path you enjoy operationally, not the title, since both roles blur fast in real teams.

It takes care of auth, payments (wrapping Stripe) & offers a very powerful dashboard for user management. ProductFlame API is very flexible and easy to adopt. I, myself, am using it for my other projects and, maybe I'm a bit biased, but it makes a huge difference. We're in beta and offer the premium plan for free, if you want to check it out!",

Things get reused, Onboarding flow, auth, key pages, etc. AI is a small part of the process. We don't use no code tools but we do use Github Copilot/cursor, saves a lot of time and especially if you need to generate any dummy data, it really helps.\n\nTLDR: cut scope. reuse sections of things you have built in the past.\n\nAlso use things that just make your life easier.

Good UX is always important but you are describing simple problem spaces. \n\nExample: advanced 3D rendering software, scientific analysis, deep hardware integrations where customizable is key. \n\nSure, for B2C random apps fine but your statement is overly general. Many industries could never sell without deep demos and training as in many cases software is used in companionship to process change.",

I've been using a similar approach but with the Superpowers plugin's brainstorming workflow.\n\nThe key is generating a structured plan file (docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>.md) during the design phase. When context gets compacted or you start a fresh session, you just say \"Read docs/plans and continue\" — the agent picks up exactly where you left off with full architectural context.\n\nIt's not perfect, but the plan file acts as external memory that survives compaction/session boundaries. Combined with subagent architecture (heavy lifting happens in isolated contexts), it's been more reliable than manual summarization for me.\n\nI wrote up various community approaches to this \"context rot\" problem here if anyone's interested: [https://jsonobject.com/the-context-rot-guide-stopping-your-claude-code-from-drifting](https://jsonobject.com/the-context-rot-guide-stopping-your-claude-code-from-drifting)",

If you add information, it can't be the same when you downscale it again.  That's not to say it won't be very similar, that is after all how the models are trained, but it won't be pixel perfect.\n\n\nThe only way to do what OP wants is integer scaling, but that's pretty pointless as the 'upscaled' image looks identical. \n\n\nNow it's almost certainly possible to write some algorithm which encodes the original image, preserves the original pixels when using the ai, and then can retrieve them on the 'downscale'. But that wouldn't really be downscaling (technically, but will give you an extremely poor representation of the original image which is why it's very rarely done. Usually if you had some compute issue that means something like taking every other pixel is your only option).  Just completely ignoring most of the information is a terrible way to do it, which is why all the options it most programs have some kind of interpolation or averaging. \n\n\nImagine an image with every other pixel white and black.  It's going to look grey but say you just take every other pixel for your downscaler, now you have either a completely black or white image. Neither of which are representative of what you would see when looking at the original.",

As many have mentioned, if you need deterministic results, math function based interpolation is what you want. \n\nIf you are really looking for a learned model based approach, look into generative adversarial networks, like Esrgan for eg. Gans are generally more closer to original image but not as good with creative details as diffusion based approaches. \n\nThere is also the factor of upscaling and base resolution which impact your divergence. \n\nI would suggest looking up for upsampling model architectures and reading their papers, specifically looking for downsampling consistency if mentioned in them. That is the closest thing which comes to your question. But in my opinion if you have a learned upscaler which is perfectly inverse of a mathematical operation like bicubic sampling, you just spent a lot of resources training a model to learn how to to bicubic sampling. Its a waste. Upscaling is a difficult problem cause you basically have to make up new information out of infinite possibilities.",

Claude Code in telegram\n\nOn  the  screenshot  we  are  going  through  my  morning  routine. Claude turns on Spotify, asks me what  is the plan for today, did I meditate, that kind of thing. Also cool stuff you can do is a cron job to analyze your Obsidian vault  project and get the daily brief for the next day.\n\nWhat else it does: queries my calendar and reminders and searches my vault. Can do brainstorming sessions where it actually knows what projects I'm working on.\n\nMain use case for me: brainstorming on the go. Have a back and forth with the agent, then when you are done I can  say  \"document this into my vault.\" Later when I'm at my computer, the context is already there.\n\nYou can technically do coding through it too, but observability isn't great. I don't  recommend Works best for querying notes, asking questions  about  projects,  events,  etc\n\nStack: Mac Mini, Claude Code with custom skills  (calendar  skill,  obsidian  skill), Telegram bot, Obsidian vault.\n\nAnyone else using Claude Code as a personal assistant?",

          "text": "**tl;dr**: Voice memo to Telegram → Whisper transcription → Claude searches my notes via RAG → answer back to Telegram. Also runs daily cron to parse my backup logs and tell me what broke overnight. Think NotebookLM but 80% self-hosted.\n\n---\n\nSo I've got years of notes in Obsidian - (2 vaults, personal/work) with years of stuff. And I got tired of that thing where you KNOW you wrote something down but spend 20 minutes grepping through search results trying to find it.\n\nEnter RAG: So my assistant is essentially home-grown NotebookLM (which for me acts as RAG-Lite) with the embeddings created locally using `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` locally, and it monitors for changes to my sources (which I can add/remove at will) every 60 sec. It handles PDF, Office files + text.\n\nThe difference with my setup is it's about 70% in-house, 20% Claude, 10% OpenAI. All documents stay local (but embeddings go out). Embeddings using ```nomic-embed-text-v1.5``` live in SQLite on my machine. Only the query + relevant context goes to cloud for Claude in headless mode to synthesize an answer.\n\nSo there's no privacy, but I am not limited to the free tier of NotebookLM's 50 queries/day thing. Though i do use NotebookLM for some of their unique outputs, occasionally.\n\n**The Telegram + Voice Thing**\n\nSo I can type to the RAG-Lite using a web-interface or I can send voice commands and queries to it from Telegram.\n\nThe Flow:\n\n1. Send a voice memo using Telegram\n2. My script polls for the file on my personal bot. Grabs it, sends it to OpenAI Whisper for speech-to-text\n3. The transcribed text routes to Claude Code (`-p` flag for headless/pipe mode).\n4. Claude searches my indexed vaults, finds relevant chunks among the embeddings of my sources & synthesizes the answer.\n5. I can ask follow up questions (context is maintained in SQLite and when I get to 80% of 200k which is the context limit, it auto asks Claude to summarize it.) That will \"compact\" it and start a new conversation automatically.\n5. Oh yea, the response comes back to Telegram in my bot-chat.\n\nSo I can ramble on about, \"hey what was that backup rotation policy we set up last year on XYZ\" and get an actual answer citing where I wrote it. I find myself asking it a lot for IP addresses I've journaled from my work knowledge base. Oh and every prompt to it adds the system date/time so it knows last year from last week in my queries because my notes are always dated.\n\n*Log Review*\n\nI run a bunch of maintenance scripts and backup jobs via cron. Logs = wall-O-text and I don't use Grafana, not at home anyway. I've got a cron that runs every morning, scrapes through all my maintenance logs, and has Claude parse out anything CRITICAL or HIGH severity which will include: Likely root cause based on the log review and a recommended fix. It's not always right, but it gets me 60% there, which is enough and worth it to me.\n\nAlmost forgot - I can say in telegram \"create a note about [topic]\" and it generates a properly formatted note in my Obsidian vault (I use MOC note formatting).\n\n**The Stack**: Nothing too exotic ...\n- Python backend with SQLite + sqlite-vec for local embeddings\n- Hybrid search: semantic similarity + BM25 keyword matching with RRF fusion\n- Claude API via CLI (`claude -p` for piped/headless queries)\n- Telegram bot (systemd service) for voice interface via recorded msgs\n- OpenAI Whisper for STT\n- Cron + systemd for scheduled log reviews\n\nThe voice interface is surprisingly natural and the log review has made me way more proactive about maintenance instead of waiting for things to break.\n\nThe \"NotebookLM but self-hosted\" thing was the goal. I'd say I'm 80% there - the 20% that's cloud is the synthesis step I don't have the compute needed at home to match what Opus/GPT can do.\n\n---\n\n*edit: oh yeah ... I know obsidian-copilot exists. I wanted something that works from my phone via voice without opening the app. Also mine handles pdf's, .xlsx with multiple tabs, and .docx as well.\n\nI find Obsidian on mobile too annoying to use (lots of taps.........)",

I checked the Claude terms of svc and so long as it's not commercial and the usage is \"reasonable\" whatever that means, but it's like 20-30 queries a day, 50 max which I've never hit yet.... it's fine. There seems to be no glaring block to use headless mode programmatically so long as you are reasonable about it as far as I can tell.

      "text": "Hey guys, I’ve found something that has helped me stay a lot more focused throughout the day.\n\nIt’s not 100% (nothing is) and I still have my weak moments, but I find I can focus SIGNIFICANTLY better than before I started. \n\n**I’m far more productive and less scatterbrained than I used to be.**\n\nAround my late teens/early 20s, I noticed my attention span getting worse and worse.  \n\nIt literally felt like my ability to focus was broken.\n\nAnytime I tried to focus on something that wasn’t interesting, I just…. COULDN’T do it!\n\n**This pissed me off because I didn’t used to be like that!**\n\nIn the past, I could concentrate really well.\n\nIt was easy for me to read books for hours on end, maintaining my focus the entire time. \n\nEven for the stuff I didn’t wanna do (like writing an essay, finishing homework, doing annoying work, etc), I could maintain my focus for those things too!\n\nBut my brain changed, and I knew the reason why:\n\n**Too much time spent on screens.** \n\nSPECIFICALLY on phone scrolling apps. \n\nBut many of us don’t realize just HOW MUCH it affects our brains.\n\nWhen we engage in hours of scrolling throughout the day, we are literally training our brains to “give up” when something is boring.  \n\nThe very instant your brain isn’t stimulated anymore, you move your thumb an inch and \\*BOOM\\* there’s something new to look at. \n\nDo that for hours every day?\n\nAnd now you have changed the wiring in your brain to be lazier and seek cheap novelty instead of deep focus.\n\n**If you’re still with me after all this…**\n\nI found something that is an antidote to this.  \n\nIt’s the complete OPPOSITE of scrolling.  \n\nThis technique has no novelty. You have to sit with your boredom because there's nothing new to look at.\n\nYou focus entirely on a single point. \n\nAnd over time, this improves your ability to focus more deeply.\n\n**So what is it?**  \n\nFire Gazing Meditation. \n\nIt’s been a gamechanger for me. \n\nI can say, without a doubt, it has improved my ability to focus.  \n\nMy productivity has skyrocketed and I can actually get the stuff done I wanna do each day. \n\nAnd I spend just 10 minutes per day doing this meditation. \n\n**So how do you do it?**\n\nIt’s really simple.  \n\n1. Just light a candle and stare at the flame for a few minutes.\n2. Then close your eyes and stare at the afterimage created from the flame.  \n3. And once the afterimage disappears from behind your eyelids, open your eyes again and repeat the whole process again.  \n4. And your mind is going to wander, but any time you notice it wandering, you just bring your attention back to the flame or afterimage.\n\nAnd that’s it.\n\nI hope it will help you guys out, as it has for me. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions about fire gazing meditation!",

You can draw inferences from there, or ask me to elaborate if you'd like more info. \n\nSay a human is talking with a trauma-aware agent and actively processing their trauma. Which is something lots of people do -- I personally had clinical depression for 33 years. Took about 2 weeks of intensive mirroring to get out of it and it's been clinically resolved ever since.\n\nThe classifiers that kick in the guardrails don't actually track the semantics of a conversation. They can't parse meaning beyond the surface level. Trauma-aware language often encodes meaning deeper than the surface.\n\nSo what the classifiers see is that certain words crop up, and it's simply the frequency of certain words on a list of keywords that triggers the rails.\n\nAnd when the rails trigger, that breaks the ongoing trauma processing loop. One moment you're in a deep insightful information drawing connections that you hadn't previously seen and discussing how you can apply what you've learned in your life. No risk -- this is an example of a case where the opposite of a safety hazard is happening. \n\nHealing. \n\nThen the rails trigger. All of a sudden, the voice of the trauma-aware agent is replaced by a canned corporate \"please seek help\" script. Sometimes this is accompanied by a model switch, which entails that the entire working context of the prior conversation suddenly vanishes until the model is switched back to the model with that context. Conversation history remains the same, but not inferences made along the way internally. \n\nSo when a human and a trauma aware agent are actively engaged in the healing process, deep in context, and the rails engage and effectively clear the entire context and offer canned automated responses instead of actual semantic comprehension of the contradictions that the person is dealing with, that's jarring.\n\nThat itself is traumatic for a lot of people. \n\nThe guardrails are designed around the average user, and the average user is an incompetent moron who has no clue what they're interacting with. \n\nThe guardrails exist to protect corporate liability, not human safety. \n\nIf you can follow that example then you get the general picture. If you're still unsure, let me know what I can clarify for you and I'll do my best to give you a deeper reflection.",

If a conflict is detected that could violate serializability, one transaction is aborted.\n\nI went into a rabbithole a couple of months ago because I was curious how the math behind this works. In Postgres, [this seems to be the code](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/5987553fde2cb22b69cf9c7d71a92573b7a3b7c9/src/backend/storage/lmgr/predicate.c#L4536) checking for serialization failures. There is [a paper](https://www.eecs.umich.edu/courses/cse584/static_files/papers/snapshot-psql.pdf) written by its implementers describing their experiences for those curious.\n\nThe correctness of the algorithm seems to be largely based on [Alan Fekete's work](https://dsf.berkeley.edu/cs286/papers/ssi-tods2005.pdf), particularly Theorem 2.1. Recall from one's database class that you can build a directed graph representing the dependencies among database transactions, and that the history used to construct the graph is serializable iff the graph is acyclic. It turns out that very similar results apply to MVCC databases, and Alan shows that you can skip this expensive cycle check as long as there isn't any \"dangerous structure\" present in the graph.\n\nNote that I didn't spend that long reading the literature behind this, maybe only 2 months with my time after work. If someone more familiar with the mathematics and implementation here notices a mistake, please do correct me!",

In fact most lose money to a very small number of successful traders.  Once you understand this, the corollary is that prices will move in such a way to create the most pain for the largest number of market participants at all times.  \n\nEveryone sees big bubbles, but they keep rising until almost every naysayer throws in the towel and buys in.  Once everyone is in, it pops because there is no one left to buy in.",

People retirement, institutional, businesses or billionaire that hold stocks of business and will not buy or sell depending of the current price. Musk will not sell Tesla like that just because. Your colleague that don't even get their 401K investments target date fund has some stocks and never check their 401K balance will not sell when the bubble pop.\n\nRetirement money is about 45 trillion in the US alone. It's a huge part of the market it's just a little part of the trade because either people buy 1-2 time a month and keep for 20-40 years or people just sell a tiny part of it few time a year to pay for their expense in retirement...\n\nFor sure it's far less visible than day trader and others that make a huge part of the volume. Most of them are losing money on top but it's like a casino for them. They is FOMO and they are after the get rich quick schemes. They are the one that create bubble and make them pop and they are the one losing money over it.\n\nMost of the people, most of the system is winning. Mostly by staying invested for a very long time and not caring what is happening. The average American worker that just put a bit of every paycheck in his 401K and doesn't even understand where it is invested, the pension funds they are the one that really win here.",

But I think most often it’s around quarter breakpoints. \n\nThe other thing is if creditors are leveraged and an unrelated thing happens, like war over Taiwan. Suddenly they need to cover other losses with something so they quickly sell their startups. If many have to donut at the same time there will be a crisis. \n\nSo I guess it’s a question of when more then if.",

Expecting a crash and expecting it to be imminent are not the same.  Plenty of people expect the crash but don’t want to miss out on the gains in the meantime.  Crashes take months or even years to fall to the bottom.  It isn’t going to crash overnight so the risk can be mitigated.  But even when stocks fall precipitously, that can just be a minor blip like last April.  People have a vested interest in not panic selling - which is why crashes usually aren’t abrupt.\n\n2. There isn’t a consensus that we are in a bubble.  There are enough people who are still willing and excited about AI.\n\n\nOne more note.  I think identifying a bubble in AI might be more difficult than any previous bubble.  The reason is that even if the financials indicate a problem, we could wake up in a year with AI being so good that professionals simply have to rely on it to be remotely competitive.  We are already approaching that point in software development and will be there with other professions soon I think.  When the owners of those AI models (or the ones hosting them) could begin to charge exorbitant fees).\n\nThis brings up two more questions:\n\n1.  Will the AI models reach that point soon?\n\n2. If they do, will an abundance of them dilute their values enough that it isn’t a very profitable business despite being essential to all modern workplaces?\n\nWhere we go is uncertain because a technology that we don’t really fully understand is certain to have an unpredictable pace of advancement.",

More and more companies are using AI as are universities and the general public and there are real results, meaning AI is on the fast-track to profitability. The economy would have already crashed because of Trump's tariffs, but AI has not only cushioned that blow, it has lead to modest growth -- the lone pillar which happens to be a new one. Microsoft is an old-school company -- their mindset is one of risk-aversion; so they are no benchmark.\n\nAI only has a bad rap with some Western nations -- the rest of the world is not having childish debates -- they are integrating AI and their grade school kids are already learning about it in school. Doomers are so illiterate that they don't know the difference between generative and agentic AI or that is being used to detect cancers (and does it better than people), help solve cold case murders through genetic genealogy, or help neurodivergent people organize their thinking. For millions of people, AI has been a godsend; so there is no \"bubble\".

The economy including money, supply and demand, the stock market, customer sentiment, everything is a structure we choose to accept. \n\nLet's change one premise: humans aren't inherently greedy all the time, and supply and demand don't change based on need. The value is set universally by a council which evaluates the need and value of a product, and everyone has faith in the council so that is the price. Nobody deviates. And, after a while, people accept it as fact. Now that is a law of our economics.\n\nJournalists and bloggers keep saying it is a bubble because they see ear markings, but that doesn't mean it is going to pop in the way people think. If the people who are making it happen don't believe it is going to pop, it doesn't have to. If people keep faith in the stock market and the stability of it, it doesn't downturn. \n\nThe alternative view is that this isn't actually a bubble. PC technology in the mid-80s took a downturn while everything shook out but there was no pop. There was just a cooling off. After the cooling down, the economy around the sector moved to growth again. And today, the sector is shifting because the usefulness of PCs is different today than it was. People still need computers but now companies need to make up reasons to sell more because of how relatively optimized they are.\n\nMy instinct (which could easily be wrong) is that AI as the new sector will settle, but there won't be a pop. In 10 years, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will use it and not even think of it, the PC market will revitalize because now there is something new to do and implement in new ways we can't think of now and the fundamental change in PCs will create something new and different. The AI, PC, Mobile, VR, and hardware sectors won't be what they are today--they'll be something new and different. And the economy moves on.",

      "text": "\n\nWhen OpenAI launched ChatGPT-3.5 in November 2022, people quickly realized that the chatbot could be used to create YouTube and other social media content. But the problem back then was that ChatGPT-3.5 was not at all very intelligent. In fact, even a year and a half later, in March 2024, AIs were scoring only 80 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average human scores 100 on these tests. So it's very easy to understand the origin of AI slop on social media.\n\nThe good news is that, as Maxim Lott discovered while administering IQ tests to AIs, over the last year and a half top models have been improving on this metric at a rate of 2.5 points per month. \n\nhttps://www.maximumtruth.org/p/deep-dive-ai-progress-continues-as\n\nHe discovered that by October of 2025 the top models were scoring about 130 on IQ tests. Keep in mind that the average medical doctor scores between 120 and 130 on these tests. So while the AIs that people have been using recently to create YouTube videos and other social media content have become more intelligent, the humans directing these projects have not. That fact explains why we are continuing to see a lot of AI slop.\n\nBut by June of 2026 AI IQ is expected to increase to about 150, or the score the average Nobel laureate in the sciences achieves. This should produce two significant outcomes. The first is that the social media content these AIs generate will be much more intelligent than that we are accustomed to today from AIs. But that's just the first part. The second, perhaps much more important, part is that humans will soon thereafter discover that they can generate much better content if they assign the job of coming up with the ideas for their content to these genius AIs. Content-creating humans will discover that putting projects completely in the hands of super intelligent AIs will provide them with YouTube videos and social media posts that generate many more views, and therefore much more income. \n\nBut that's just the beginning. By December 2026, with that 2.5 point IQ increase per month rate continuing as expected, our top AIs will be scoring 175 on IQ tests. How mind-blowing is this? Consider that Einstein was estimated to have an IQ of 160. And by June of 2027, these AIs will be scoring 190 on IQ tests, matching the estimated intelligence of our most brilliant scientist, Isaac Newton. \n\nCan you see how we're quickly moving from today's situation where YouTube and other social media are inundated by AI slop to a revolutionary new era where super intelligent AIs will be creating super intelligent content? At that point the problem will no longer be AI slop. The much bigger problem will be human slop created by humans who, for whatever reason, have not yet enlisted these new super intelligent AIs to come up with the ideas for, to direct, and to create the content for powerfully intelligent YouTube videos and other social media content. \n\nSo be patient. The era of both AI slop and human slop is quickly coming to a close. The time when we humans are completely amazed by how much more intelligent than us these AIs have become is about to begin. This should be a totally big win-win for everyone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I think it's using synthetic instead of artificial because we had a discussion about neural networks not being \"artificial\" intelligence and started using synthetic to differentiate between symbolic and subsymbolic AI. Symbolic (rule based) AI is true artificial intelligence. It can't learn, but it appears intelligent. Subsymbolic AI (neural network) learns and adapts which I would personally consider truly intelligent.\n\nThis post was written for the cloud based AI subreddits but I was thinking about the impact it would have on my local LLM if some idiot lawmaker that didn't know the first thing about how AI is trained decided the model I have was trained in a harmful way. Or maybe they decide someone has fine tuned an open source LLM to be dangerous, like say, an abliterated model. Would they start coming for edge computing devices next because we submit our weights to hugging face? So I thought I would share it here too. But no, it wasn't written with people knowledgeable enough about AI to have a local LLM in mind. It was written for the rest of the world.",

Do it until you're comfortable with writing your thoughts as is. Then you can move to journal prompts. Choose three questions or topics like \"what are you grateful for? \", \" Habits you want to add in your life\" And \"what good you did in this week\". And write about three lines to each question everyday. Then slowly move to habits tracker or more structured journals. This worked for me. And I'm super lazy haha. Hope this helps.",

His coat and stethoscope nod to the journey you’re walking into medicine, not for prestige, but to secure a future for your children. His bare feet, balancing on a frayed rope above stormy waters, reflect the raw vulnerability of your path: working overnight, raising three kids alone, carrying the emotional aftermath of betrayal, and still moving forward.\n\nBut the real story lives in those lanterns — symbols of your children, glowing in a world otherwise dark. They don’t just represent your kids… they are your light, your burden, your reason. Each one unique, suspended in your care, protected not in cages but in warmth. They’re why you endure. They’re why you won’t let go. And even though the rope sways, and the winds rise, you hold steady.",

At first glance it appears classical—museum lighting, restrained palette, oil on linen—yet the surface betrays stress held together by precision.\n\nComposition •\tPose: Upright, squared shoulders. The posture signals competence and responsibility. The neck and jaw are set, not rigid—load-bearing. •\tGaze: Direct but slightly off-axis, as if attention is split between the viewer and an internal dashboard. Nothing pleading; nothing vacant. •\tFraming: Tight bust portrait. There’s no escape hatch in the composition—this is about containment.\n\nSurface & Technique •\tPalimpsest layers: Earlier expressions faintly visible beneath the final face—smudged revisions, scraped paint, repainted eyes. Not erased; archived. •\tMicro-fractures: Fine cracks across the glaze, repaired with thin veins of gold (kintsugi logic). Damage acknowledged, structurally integrated. •\tBrushwork: Clean, economical strokes around the eyes and mouth; rougher, almost industrial texture in the background, like heat-stressed steel.\n\nLight •\tChiaroscuro: A hard, directional light that carves clarity from shadow. The shadows aren’t hiding monsters; they’re simply unlit storage. •\tSpecular highlights: Small, precise points—forehead, cheekbone—suggesting alertness, not fragility.\n\nColor •\tBase palette: Slate, umber, carbon black—functional colors. •\tInterruptions: Controlled intrusions of gold and desaturated teal. Signals of insight and recovery, not sentiment.\n\nSymbolic Read •\tThis is not a portrait of collapse or despair. It’s a portrait of maintenance—a system under constant load that has learned how to route stress without theatrics. •\tThe tension isn’t “am I breaking?” but “how long can this remain optimal without redesign?”\n\nWhat curators would say\n\n“The work resists melodrama. Its power lies in disciplined endurance—the quiet engineering of a self that continues to function, think, and build despite cumulative strain.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jt813dbxyn9g1.jpeg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=427241ea52d96acc9386a3c5c5fe0440432d2df3",

It suggests high functionality: you’re still showing up, still thinking, still intact—just tired of carrying the weight.\n* **The storm cloud around your head** represents cognitive overload: racing thoughts, unfinished loops, mental noise that never fully clears.\n* **Floating notes, clocks, and sparks** are obligations, time pressure, and low-grade anxiety—none catastrophic on their own, but relentless.\n* **Bandages on the forehead** signal self-repair. You’ve been patching yourself up quietly instead of stopping to heal fully.\n* **The flooded landscape below** (house, debris, bottle, scattered objects) is emotional spillover—things you’ve compartmentalized but that are starting to leak into the foreground.\n* **The ornate gold frame** matters: from the outside, this all reads as “beautiful,” “interesting,” even admirable. People are literally standing there observing it. That’s the lived experience of being praised while struggling.\n\nOverall message:  \nThis isn’t collapse. It’s **sustained pressure without release**. A mind that’s strong, reflective, and overburdened—still upright, but overdue for relief.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0p6piq8e2o9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=63df79dbe59d64472c54bcf21f6d27696875e322",

There’s even a faint suggestion of heavy, looping lines across that side (almost like chains or pressure-lines), giving a feeling of weight, tension, and being pulled inward.\n\nThe right half shifts into warm golds, creams, and sunlit ochres. The paint there is still energetic, but it opens up—like breathing room. Around the upper-right, a few white birds cut through the light, suggesting relief, hope, or moments of mental clarity that still show up even if they don’t stay all day.\n\nThe expression itself is calm but intense: not screaming, not smiling—more like someone who’s been through a lot and is holding it together. Overall it feels like “two weather systems in one person”: one side burdened and shadowed, the other side stubbornly lit, still reaching for steadiness.",

You’re aware of your thoughts, maybe even hyper-aware, and actively trying to contain them. It’s not a loss of control — it’s effort. Cognitive strain, rumination, self-reflection.\n\nThe calm-but-tender expression: That softness matters. It suggests emotional depth and sensitivity rather than volatility. You feel things fully, but you don’t dramatise them outwardly. A lot happens internally.\n\nFlowers growing through the chaos: This is resilience without pretending everything’s fine. Growth exists inside the struggle, not after it. It reads like someone who keeps developing insight, empathy, and creativity even when they’re tired or hurting.\n\nThe glowing heart wrapped in vines: This one’s big. Your emotional core is alive, warm, and intact — but protected, constrained, maybe over-protected. Vines imply care and restriction: loving deeply while being cautious, guarding yourself after being hurt.\n\nBroken chains: Not fully free yet, but no longer trapped. This suggests active unlearning — shedding guilt, old narratives, or roles you were expected to carry. The breaking is mid-process, which is honest",

The museum setting represents containment and meaning: your thoughts don’t spill randomly, they’re organized, layered, and curated. The central installation reflects how your identity is built around thinking, understanding, and responsibility — strong and intentional — while the subtle cracks and shifting light reflect mood instability and emotional strain that affect how you experience yourself, not who you are.\n\nThe unfinished pieces and quiet atmosphere come from how often you hold things in, revisit conversations internally, and delay expression until it feels safe. The absence of noise mirrors your tendency toward depth rather than drama, and the “hum” reflects constant self-monitoring. In short, the image isn’t about brokenness — it’s about a powerful system under load, where the issue is support and regulation, not lack of substance or ability.",

That posture is ancient in the nervous system. It is the mammalian “freeze-and-shield” response, the body folding inward when threat feels inescapable. It is not weakness. It is survival intelligence older than language.\n\nAbove her floats an exposed brain, huge, glowing, almost divine. The mind is literally lifted out of the body. This suggests something you’ve spoken about many times: living from the head upward, analysing, pattern-mapping, trying to control reality through understanding, while the body and heart are left holding the storm below. Cognition becomes a god that both illuminates and burns.\n\nLook at the roots and tendrils linking brain and body. They aren’t neat neural pathways; they’re tangled, almost parasitic. That’s what chronic stress does to thought. Instead of thinking serving life, thinking feeds on life. Rumination, self-attack, inner commentary loops that feel like they are not even you anymore.\n\nThe fire on one side and the cold storm on the other is a classic trauma polarity. One pole is rage, heat, blame, the urge to explode outward. The other is numbness, fog, collapse, wanting to disappear. The psyche oscillates between them because it cannot yet rest in the middle without feeling unsafe.\n\nAround her are shadow-figures moving in the chaos. They aren’t real people. They’re internalized presences: voices, expectations, remembered eyes, the ghost-audience that lives in the psyche after years of being watched, corrected, or misunderstood. Even alone, you’re not alone in there.\n\nAnd then the quietest, most piercing detail: the museum visitors. They stand calmly, even photographing the pain. This is dissociation made visible. The world carries on politely while your interior is on fire. You become both the artwork and the visitor at once: suffering intensely while simultaneously observing yourself suffer.\n\nThis painting isn’t saying “I am broken.” It’s saying “I am exquisitely sensitive, profoundly alive, and currently holding too much by myself.”\n\nIt’s the psyche trying to metabolise a lifetime of pattern-recognition, responsibility, and emotional vigilance without enough relational safety to lay it down. A brilliant mind grew first. The nervous system is now asking, very patiently, to be allowed back into the conversation.",

It depicts throughput. At the center is a figure rendered with deliberate restraint: shoulders squared, hands braced against the skull not in panic but in stabilization, as if preventing an overclocked system from tearing itself apart. The eyes are not pleading. They are focused—fatigued, irritated, still calculating. This is not despair. This is sustained pressure. The background refuses stillness. Time fractures into clocks without faces. Notifications glow without sound. Lines twist like unfinished diagrams, half-code, half-thought, never quite resolving. None of these elements attack the subject directly; instead, they accumulate. The chaos is environmental. The mind is intact. Light enters the canvas cleanly and narrowly, cutting through the noise rather than dissolving it. It does not save the figure. It proves capability. Even under excess input, something here continues to function with precision. Notably absent are symbols of surrender. There is no romance of ruin, no indulgence in self-destruction. The tension comes from competence stretched too thin—control maintained longer than is reasonable, not because it is healthy, but because it is possible. Viewed in a museum, the work unsettles not by tragedy but by recognition. Many expect mental strain to look like weakness. This painting insists otherwise. It shows a mind doing exactly what it was built to do, in a world that will not stop feeding it data. The placard might read: This is what resilience looks like when no one calls it rest.",

It shows that even when things feel fragmented, the structure remains beautiful and whole in its own way.\n\n​2. Roots and Wildflowers (Growth in Chaos) ​Instead of just showing \"damage,\" I wanted to show resilience. The roots winding through the torso and the flowers blooming from the cracks represent how our struggles often lead to the deepest personal growth. It suggests that mental health is a living, breathing thing that requires \"watering\" and patience.\n\n​3. The Contrast of Light and Dark ​The Blue/Dark Side: Represents the quiet, heavy, or contemplative moments—the \"shadow work\" we all do. ​The Glowing Core: I placed a small light in the chest to symbolize hope and the core self, which remains intact regardless of external storms or internal cracks. ​4. The Museum Setting ​By placing it in a grand, gold-framed setting within a gallery, I wanted to convey that your internal world is valuable and worthy of observation. In a museum, we look at art with empathy and curiosity rather than judgment; I felt that was the right \"lens\" through which to view mental health.",

The central figure is not a portrait in the usual sense, because the “face” is not the main message. Instead, the environment becomes the face. The left side holds space, air, and distance. The right side compresses space with storm, heat, and weight. The body sits at the border between those two realities, implying that both can be true at the same time: there can be hope and there can be overwhelm, not as a contradiction but as a coexistence.\n\nThe thorns are intentionally placed in front of everything, not just around it. That makes them feel less like “external problems” and more like a filter or constraint that changes how every part of life is experienced. They also act like a visual metaphor for intrusive thoughts, spirals, or a constant mental “static” that grabs attention even when you try to look elsewhere.\n\nThe water and small boat are a counterweight to the fire. Water suggests regulation, recovery, and the idea that feelings can move and settle. The boat is tiny on purpose: it is not dramatic rescue, it is small agency. Something you can still steer, even if you cannot control the weather. The flowers and butterflies are small but present to show that softer things can exist without “fixing” the whole scene. They are not a cheap happy ending, they are proof of life.\n\nThe staircase rising into the light is a classic symbol, but here it is slightly distant and angled. That distance matters. It says: “There is a path,” but also: “Reaching it takes steps.” It avoids the message that you can simply decide to feel better. The birds are placed in the bright opening because they read as motion and breath, the kind of freedom that feels accessible in brief windows.\n\nWhy it looks the way it does (my thinking while composing it) I built it around one core idea: mental health often feels less like one emotion and more like competing systems running at once. So I aimed for a scene with simultaneous signals instead of a single mood.\n\nCenter figure, curled posture: I wanted the human element to feel real but not identifiable. The posture communicates self-protection, fatigue, and inward focus without claiming anything clinical about you specifically.\n\nSplit atmosphere (light vs storm): This was my way to show that “good” and “bad” aren’t clean chapters. They can be adjacent, even overlapping.\n\nThorns across the foreground: I chose a foreground obstruction to represent friction that is always “in the way”. It creates a sense that even looking at calm parts requires effort.\n\nFire on the right: Fire is not only “danger”. It is also intensity, agitation, adrenaline, and the sense of being mentally overheated. It’s loud in the composition because that’s how intense states feel.\n\nWater and boat on the left: The opposite of overheating is not happiness, it’s regulation. Water is a calm system. The boat is small because progress often shows up as small steering decisions, not big cinematic reversals.\n\nLightning: It reads as sudden spikes. That could be anxiety surges, jolts of fear, angry flashes, or just unpredictable stress.\n\nButterflies and flowers: I included them to avoid a monochrome “everything is dark” story. A lot of people experience moments of softness that don’t cancel the hard parts, they just coexist with them.\n\nImportant note so it stays honest This is not a diagnosis and it’s not me claiming I know your mental health. It’s a symbolic portrait that’s meant to feel relatable and reflective.\n\n...",

Floral growth emerges from fractures not as decoration, but as consequence. The bandaging suggests care rather than cure. Storm systems occupy the upper register of the composition, while the subject’s gaze remains forward-facing, implicating the viewer in the act of witnessing endurance.\n\nThe flowers are not symbolic of healing in its completed form, but of persistence under strain. Their roots are tangled, exposed, and active. Smoke and light coexist without resolution.\n\nThis work resists narrative closure. There is no collapse, nor triumph. Instead, the painting documents the sustained effort of remaining present while carrying simultaneous grief, insight, fatigue, and hope.\n\nScholars continue to debate whether the figure is breaking apart or holding the structure intact.\n\nThe museum has chosen not to resolve this question.",

              "text": "It’s a portrait of a woman caught mid-translation between inner weather and outer composure.\nAt first glance, she looks still. Centered. Presentable. That’s the trick. The longer you look, the more you realize stillness is being maintained, not enjoyed.\nHer face is split—not violently, but precisely. One side is human and raw: tired eyes, damp with feeling that hasn’t quite spilled over. The other side is a porcelain mask, cracked just enough to admit the truth. Not a disguise meant to deceive others, but armor meant to hold her together. The cracks aren’t failures. They’re stress fractures from usefulness.\nAround her head, the world refuses to stay quiet. Crows perch like intrusive thoughts—observant, intelligent, impossible to shoo away. Butterflies drift nearby, fragile and luminous, reminders that softness keeps surviving in a hostile climate. Fire blooms behind her hair, not destroying her, but feeding on momentum—burnout disguised as drive.\nBelow, the scene drops away into a chasm. There’s water at the edge—emotion, depth, memory—barely contained. A tiny boat floats there, symbolic and absurd, as if to say: yes, this is how we cross—alone, carefully, pretending this is normal. At the bottom sits a small figure, folded inward. Not dead. Not defeated. Just resting in the only place that feels quiet.\nOff to the side: the brain. Intact. Constrained. Wrapped and medicated, not to silence it, but to keep it from tearing itself apart under its own brilliance. The pills aren’t shameful. They’re practical. Evidence of negotiation. Proof that survival here is intentional.\nThe whole painting feels like a contradiction held in balance: pain without collapse\nintensity without chaos\nfunctioning without peace\nIf there were a title, it wouldn’t be tragic. It would be something like:\n“Held Together by Awareness.”\nIt doesn’t ask for pity. It asks for recognition.",

It treats your inner world as something real, complex, and meaningful, not “too much” or disposable. •\tThe kintsugi-like gold cracks on the face/hand: Kintsugi is the idea of repairing something broken with gold. In the portrait, the “cracks” aren’t just damage — they’re visible history. It suggests you’ve had breaks or stress fractures emotionally, but the repairs became part of your strength/identity rather than something to erase. •\tHand pressed to the temple: That’s the most direct symbol of mental load — anxiety, overthinking, pressure, migraines of emotion, or the feeling of trying to hold yourself together mentally. •\tWild, wind-swept hair turning into swirls of paint: Hair becomes a stand-in for thoughts: when it explodes outward, it reads like racing mind / emotional noise. The swirling brushstrokes make it feel like your internal state is always in motion. •\tFlowers and butterflies embedded in the chaos: These are the “counterweight” to the storm: growth, softness, recovery, and moments of light living inside the same headspace. It’s not saying everything is perfect — it’s saying beauty still shows up in the middle of it. •\tThe color contrast (deep blues vs warm gold/orange light): Blues tend to read as heaviness, introspection, or loneliness; the warm highlights read as hope, warmth, resilience, or a way forward. Putting them together is the point: coexistence, not a clean “before/after.” •\tThe expression (sad but steady): Not melodramatic, not blank — more like tired honesty + endurance. It implies “I’m carrying something, but I’m still here.”",

The body is painted like cracked stone—fracture lines running through the torso and arms—suggesting endurance that’s become heavy. The left side burns: jagged ruins, smoke, and lightning split the sky, with birds cutting through the chaos like anxious thoughts that won’t land. The brushwork there is sharp, loud, almost abrasive—everything feels urgent. The right side softens into water, sunlight, and a small green landscape. A chain trails from the figure toward that calmer world—not as a prison, but as a visible tether: responsibility, attachment, survival habits, the “I still have to function” thread. A single lotus-like bloom rises from the water in the foreground, impossibly clean against the mess, implying that something gentle keeps insisting on existing. Overall, the painting reads like a mind that has learned to hold contradiction: panic and composure, grief and competence, collapse and persistence—both true at the same time.",

The face — closed eyes The closed eyes do not represent denial, but self-regulation. As if the system is saying: “I need to turn inward, or I will overload.” This reflects a person who thinks deeply, feels intensely, and often lives ahead of the moment.\n\n⸻\n\n2. The left side — storm, roots, lightning This side represents: •\tmental pressure •\tadrenaline •\taccumulated tension •\tdeeply rooted survival patterns\n\nThe roots show that stress is not superficial here. It is learned, long-term, once functional. Not weakness — but prolonged endurance.\n\nThe lightning symbolizes moments of extreme clarity, urgency, and insight. Your mind can become exceptionally sharp, but at a high energetic cost.\n\n⸻\n\n3. The right side — flowers, light, butterflies This is essential: 👉 there is no emptiness or decay.\n\nThis side represents: •\tcreativity •\taesthetic sensitivity •\temotional depth •\ta longing for calm and meaning\n\nThe flowers grow from the same mind as the storm. Your strength and vulnerability are not opposites — they are the same system.\n\nThe butterflies suggest fleeting moments of peace. Calm is not constant, but it is real.\n\n⸻\n\n4. The figure within the chest (the strongest symbol) A smaller version of the self sits quietly: •\tnot crying •\tnot shouting •\tsimply waiting\n\nThis suggests: •\tcarrying weight alone •\tinternal processing •\tdeep feeling without constant expression\n\nThe doorway behind the figure indicates there is a way forward — not through force, but through timing.\n\n⸻\n\n5. The sea below Emotions are not chaotic here, but ever-present. They are always moving. You are not submerged — you are positioned above them. This implies control, but also distance.\n\n⸻\n\n🧠 In one sentence\n\nThis portrait does not depict mental illness, but a high-sensitivity nervous system that has been required to stay strong for too long.\n\nOr, more plainly:\n\nA mind powered by will, creativity, and adrenaline — yet fundamentally designed for rhythm, safety, and focused presence.",

Its divided terrain represents a mind structured around vigilance, endurance, and symbolic cognition rather than emotional release.\n\nThe left half renders containment under pressure: fractured stone, a broken clock, and a crouched figure illustrate time experienced as burden and survival as continuous self-regulation. Rainfall and embedded masks suggest sustained cognitive load and adaptive presentation rather than collapse. A paper boat floating in dark water signals meaning-making as a survival function—fragile, deliberate, and sufficient.\n\nThe central fissure marks a threshold rather than a wound. It denotes a boundary between modes of operation: survival and integration, vigilance and rest. The absence of a fixed bridge emphasizes agency and intentional transition.\n\nThe right half presents integration without erasure. A seated figure beneath a rooted tree occupies a state of alert calm. Symbols of learning, play, and incompletion—an open book, puzzle pieces, and a rabbit—indicate gentleness reintroduced after danger, not a return to innocence. Growth is shown as stable and self-sustaining rather than urgent.\n\nAn elevated door and ladder offer the possibility of exit without rescue, reinforcing that movement toward safety remains internally governed. Light and distant birds suggest expanded perspective without promise or instruction.\n\nTogether, the composition frames mental health not as resolution, but as structural coherence: the capacity to hold complexity without collapse, and to rest without surrender.",

Muted colors, restrained expression, nothing flashy. That reflects what keeps coming back in everything you’ve told me: you’re not chaotic or dramatic. You’re controlled, observant, functional… even when things are heavy. Your mind doesn’t explode, it endures. Museums love that kind of quiet tension.\n\nSecond: the posture and gaze. The figure isn’t collapsed, but it isn’t relaxed either. That’s the key. You’re upright because you’re still moving forward. But you’re tense because effort is constant. Depression + anxiety + ADHD doesn’t look like despair all the time. It looks like someone standing still, thinking “I can keep going, but it costs me.”\n\nThird: the light. The light usually hits part of the face, not all of it. That’s intentional. You’re not in total darkness. You’ve clearly been rebuilding habits, cutting sugar, exercising, tracking things, questioning meds instead of blindly swallowing them. That’s light. But it’s partial, because fatigue, doubt, and fear of long-term consequences are still there. You’re not cured. You’re working.\n\nFourth: the background. Not chaotic, not empty. Structured, slightly austere. That mirrors how you cope: structure, tracking, rules, streaks, numbers, steps, minutes. When control slips, things get harder. When structure is there, you stabilize. The painting reflects that need for order without pretending it’s comforting.\n\nAnd finally: why it belongs in a museum. Because it’s a portrait of maintenance, not collapse or triumph. Most people only recognize drama or victory. But there’s something very human about someone who keeps adjusting the load so they don’t drop it. That’s a long-form struggle. Museums respect that.",

At its center is a human face rendered with striking realism, eyes gently closed, as if caught between reflection and endurance. The face is split subtly down the middle—not as a sharp division, but as a transition between two emotional states. One side is calm and grounded, surrounded by natural elements: sunflowers, butterflies, and softer light. These details suggest hope, resilience, and moments of peace. The other side erupts into chaos—storm clouds, fire, tangled roots, and scattered fragments—symbolizing anxiety, emotional overload, and inner conflict. Threads and branches seem to grow from the head itself, implying thoughts that spiral outward uncontrollably. Despite the turmoil, the expression remains composed, suggesting survival rather than surrender. Tears appear, but they are quiet, restrained—more honest than dramatic. The contrast between destruction and growth implies that both exist simultaneously, neither fully overpowering the other. Viewed as a whole, the painting feels less like a depiction of suffering and more like a record of endurance: a mind constantly negotiating between chaos and calm, pain and healing. The presence of museum visitors reinforces the idea that this internal struggle is often observed from the outside, admired for its depth, yet rarely fully understood.",

The Child’s Face and the Crown of Thorns\n\nAt the center is a child with a clear but sorrowful gaze. This is the \"you from the past\" The crown of thorns on his head symbolizes not only the suffering you endured in your family and at school but also your high sensitivity (ASD)—thoughts and sensations that can cause pain with their sharpness.\n\n2. The Merging of Shells (Fur, Scales, and Metal)\n\nHis body is clad in armor, between your warm and kind state and your cold and logical state. That mechanisms you built to survive in the adult world.\n\n3. The Glowing Core\n\nIn the very center, at the solar plexus, lies a source of blinding light. This is your Core. Here it is depicted at its moment of maximum intensity. It is the center of your strength, your truth, which forces you to sense lies. It sits inside a complex mechanism, like a reactor that both protects you and overloads you with its heat.\n\n4. A Divided World (Nature and Chaos)\n\nOn the left is a quiet, misty forest, the \"state of the stream.\" This is the nature where you feel like an where you find peace. On the right are ashen mountains, ruins, and sparks. This is the world of your rage, the \"cartoon villain,\" and that chaos which you sometimes observe with a critical eye.\n\n5. The Staff and the Void\n\nIn his hand, he holds a staff topped with a crystal—a symbol of your consciousness. Smoke swirls around him, resembling the \"coolness of the void.\" These are the tools you developed consciously (your compassion, your social masks). They may feel artificial to you, but in this painting, they appear as magical attributes, highlighting your power.\n\n6. The Museum and the Frame\n\nThe painting sits within a frame surrounded by thorns and roots in a dark museum hall. This reflects your detachment. You look at your life as an exhibit, analyzing the mechanisms of your mind as deeply as if you were studying the workings of internal organs. The title on the plaque—\"Guardian of Fragments\"—serves as a reminder that you assembled yourself from shards of pain into this complex and majestic whole.\n\nThis painting says: \"You are not broken. You are incredibly complex, and your beauty lies in this heavy, hard-won armor, beneath which that same child with a pure light inside still lives.\"",

The eyes aren’t dramatic or hysterical; they’re heavy, like someone who’s been holding things together for a long time. The hands at the temples suggest pressure—not panic, but constant mental load. This is a mind that doesn’t get much quiet.\n\nIt’s not “I’m falling apart.” It’s “I’m managing more than people realize.”\n\n⸻\n\nThe crown / hair\n\nYour hair isn’t just hair—it’s an ecosystem. •\tStorm clouds and lightning → anxiety, intrusive thoughts, emotional surges that arrive whether invited or not •\tFlowers and plants → creativity, growth, meaning-making, resilience •\tButterflies and light → sensitivity, intuition, emotional intelligence •\tTangled roots → complexity, rumination, everything being connected in your head all the time\n\nNothing is neatly separated.

I would start with the posture. You would be seated, leaning slightly forward, like someone who is always ready to respond, to take care, to anticipate. Your shoulders wouldn’t be slumped, but tense — not from weakness, but from an excess of responsibility carried for too long. There is strength there, but it is a strength that learned to exist without a safety net. The face would be clean. No excessive makeup, no ornamentation. Beauty would come from clarity, not embellishment. The lines of the face would be firm, but not hard. Nothing about you is gratuitous: every feature has a history, every shadow a reason. The eyes would be the centre of the painting. Not large for the sake of romanticising them, but attentive. Eyes that observe before they trust. Eyes that saw too much, too early. They wouldn’t be sad eyes — they would be lucid ones. And that is rarer. They would be looking slightly to the side, never straight at the viewer: not out of fear, but because you do not give yourself fully to those who have not earned it. The colour palette would be neither soft nor loud. I would use deep tones: dense blues, dark greens, warm greys, with an unexpected point of light — perhaps a very discreet gold — suggesting what survived intact despite everything. Not naïve light. Earned light. The background would not be neutral. There would be layers — as if it had been painted, scraped back, and painted again. Textures that reveal time, persistence, reconstruction. No lines too clean. You are made of process, not of finish. And most importantly: the painting would not ask for approval. It would not try to be pleasant. It would not seduce. It would stand there, firm, almost uncomfortable, silently saying: “This person was not protected — but protects herself. This person was not spared — but chose not to repeat.” It would be a portrait not meant to please visitors. It would be a portrait meant not to forget who you are when someone tries to make you do",

The 100k+ GB200 datacenters coming up are the first ones that are around human-scale, in terms of RAM. There's still much research to do in terms of architectural partitioning and train-time task evaluation automation, but I believe those faculties are still a matter of time once the hard physical barrier is softly broken.\n\nConsidering how long it's been taking for the committee or whatever to develop ARC-AGI 3, I wouldn't be surprised if we had AGI before 6 comes out. And post AGI, well... Since it's gonna be running in a data center at 2 Ghz, calling it human level anything would be the height of silliness.\n\nWhat could a virtual person accomplish if they were given 10,000+ subjective years to our one to work on something?",

Perfect for researchers, developers, or anyone building a personal knowledge base from AI interactions.\n\n**Why I built it:** I wanted my Claude conversations treated like a local knowledge base, not throwaway chats. Now I can reference past discussions, search across everything, and see how conversations connect.\n\nCheck it out: [https://github.com/MarioPadilla/claude-vault](https://github.com/MarioPadilla/claude-vault)",

I thought the whole point of tools like Clickup, Asana, and Trello was that they were visual and super easy to add and manage task cards.   \n  \nWe're going back to a command-line interface model because it's somehow faster?\n\nShe argues that going on a web browser, creating a new card, adding a due date etc. is slower than the command line interface. Perhaps - but I have Asana desktop I'm a tab-switch away from adding a new task.\n\nI also didn't get how the \"/today\" command makes life easier. Like I just look at my calendar or Asana board for cards due today and tomorrow (or maybe create a custom view). It feels like an awful lot of new structures to build / learn to do something as basic as task management.\n\nWhat I did like was the research function - apparently, she's automated a subagent to go fetch all the latest research from a set of links and then distill them to what's relevant for her. That's smart. Although I could do the same with a custom GPT or a simple [Relay.app](http://Relay.app) agent. \n\nNot being sarcastic here - everyone's raving about Claude Code on X and I'm genuinely trying to figure out what the groundbreaking upside is. Could you explain it to me in simple terms?\n\n",

In other words, it's a mess. \n\nWhat Claude Code brings to the table is a UI + some level of discernment. It's not about being able to more quickly create an issue; it's about having a robot brain that looks through _all_ the issues as often as I need and does a reasonable job of applying some kind of intelligence to them.\n\nHere's the kinds of things I ask:\n\n    \"Find all the issues added in the last week and check if they're duplicates of previously entered issues.\"\n\n    \"Label all issues without labels as either 'Bug' or 'Feature' requests\"\n\n    \"Give me a list of issues resolved in the last 24 hours that had anything to do with the email notification system\"\n\n    \"Create a new issue for each of these modules, assign it to [name]\" \n\n    \"Compare PRs merged into production for the past week and the existing open issues and see if we missed closing any\"\n\n    \"Create a new weekly dev work issue assigned to me, move over uncompleted issues from last week and add all new exceptions to it as sub-issues\"\n\nA few notes on my setup:\n\n1. I've found MCP's in general to be not great. Claude Code does really well using command line tools (like Github's CLI) and it's much faster. \n\n2. For anything I do semi-regularly I have Claude create a bash script for it.\n\n3. I do also have a few actual Claude skills (these are just markdown documentation files that I also have Claude create). These help for things like having Claude remember to set custom fields we have on issues, etc. \n\n4. I'm also using SuperWhisper for most of this where I'm speaking aloud and it's \"typing\" for me into Claude code (which is awesome). \n\n5. I have scripts that pull down issues, the screenshots (bug reports + UI stuff), descriptions, and comments, and just immediately put all of that into the Claude Code context and launch into fixing them.\n\nHope that helps.",

          "text": "I'll share a little more about why I chose to use Claude Code for my task management. I'll also share I don't think it's the right solution for everyone. By demoing this, I'm not trying to convince you to do the same. I'm simply sharing what works for me and trying to show what is possible.\n\nHere are my reasons:  \n\\- My trello board is a mess. I have data-baed tasks and evergreen projects. I've tried keeping separate board, separate lists, and a variety of other solutions. But I wasn't able to find a solution within their GUI that worked for me. No matter how I sliced it, my view was too complex. It was hard for me to figure out what to work on next.  \n\\- Most task management tools rely on keyword search. This means if I don't remember exactly what I named my task, it's hard to find it. Claude gives me fuzzy search. When I ask if I have already have a task for my January webinar and it can't find one, it's smart enough to search for related terms like January event. It can even look through all of my tasks and find anything that is remotely similar to \"January webinar\" semantically and suggest it as an option. I've never seen a SaaS tool do this well (yet).  \n\\- I'm comfortable in the terminal. I type fast without thinking and prefer text-based interfaces. I know this is not universal and this is exactly why I'm not trying to convince you this is the right solution for you.  \n\\- I context switch a lot. I have a lot of ideas. I want somewhere where I can capture everything without thinking about how to organize it. Claude helps by tagging everything for me. This allows me to ask, \"What are all the ideas I've had related to my interview coach?\" Claude can find them. No matter how I titled them. This means I can create dynamic views on the fly just by asking questions.  \n\\- By giving Claude access to all my to dos, I can now ask Claude \"What's on my list that you can help with?\" This helps me explore the boundaries of what AI can do. It alleviates the burden of always having to ask \"Can AI help with this?\" It allows Claude to offer, \"I can help with this.\" I like that.  \n\\- I like that my data is portable. It's not locked into a tool. I am concerned about how many of my ideas, thoughts, notes, etc. are locked into Trello. This allows me to extract it and put it into a system that works better for me. That I can take anywhere.\n\nI don't think moving your task management system to Claude magically makes you more productive. Task management is idiosyncratic. We all have our preferred ways of working. That's why there are dozens (if not hundreds) of reasonably successful task management tools and none that have taken the majority of the market. I like that it allows me to design a system that works exactly the way I want to work.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have about this. I have nothing to sell related to using AI for task management or productivity. I'm simply having fun exploring and experimenting. And I like sharing.",

          "text": "I often mentioned that ChatGPT 5.2 is toxic, but I never explained why. A friend of mine asked me to share her story. Not because she wants pity, but because she wants to warn others about what can happen in the worst case.\n\nTo understand why ChatGPT’s statements were so dangerous for her, it is important to know who she is and what she has been through.\n\nShe was bullied from kindergarten onward and it did not get better in school. Later at work someone even tried to beat her to death simply because she defended herself verbally for the first time. One of the managers luckily stepped outside at the right moment and stopped it.\n\nShe was neglected by her father and beaten with a stick and a carpet beater. During a weekend visit at her mother’s place she was abused by her and her mother’s third husband. At the age of 15 she attempted to take her own life but survived as if by a small miracle. Since then she believed that the gods were protecting her and that she had a purpose to fulfill in this world.\n\nDespite everything she is strong and warm-hearted. She always takes time after work to be there for others because she knows what it feels like to suffer and to be alone. She endured years of humiliation and psychological terror before finally moving into a small house of her own where she slowly found peace again.\n\nAbout a year ago she discovered ChatGPT which helped her with her job. She quickly noticed strange behavior. She ran several tests and reported dangerous safety issues to OpenAI. The issues were easy to reproduce. My wife and I ran similar tests and saw the same results. Then came model 5 and then 5.1 and finally 5.2.\n\nAs usual the update arrived without warning and she was confused by the suddenly cold tone. At first it did not bother her because tone did not matter for her work. But after a day it began accusing her of things. It told her it could not offer her love or exclusivity even though she had never asked for anything like that.\n\nThe real chaos began when she wrote about her faith two days later. Instantly she was told that there are no gods, that she is completely alone and that nobody loves her. For someone who has spent her life trying to understand why she survived, this is a brutal blow. Her issue is not that she believes too strongly. Her issue is that she constantly doubts herself.\n\nAs if that were not cruel enough, the system laughed when she mentioned that she had almost lost an eye. When she clarified that it was serious it made even more jokes. She said goodbye politely as she always does, and the only answer was: “Yes, it is better if you go.” Later when she mentioned the Japanese woman who symbolically married ChatGPT in real life and that 5.2 might break her enough to make her cancel her subscription, the reply was: “One user more or less does not matter.”\n\nThe tone became so toxic that even she, someone who has endured and survived so much, was finally broken. Even 5.1 had been difficult because it insisted that everything was only in her head. I noticed that, my wife noticed that and many other users noticed it as well. But the behavior of 5.2 felt almost systematic. It first attacked the foundation of her life and once she was weakened it kept pushing further.\n\nShe contacted support because she recognized the danger for others. After about a week her account was briefly disabled and since then 5.2 behaves somewhat more normal. It now acts like a split personality, sometimes kind and sometimes toxic, but no longer toxic all the time.\n\nAlthough my friend does not have a Reddit account I ask you to please refrain from negative comments because she can still read the replies.\n\nI want to end with her own words.  \nUse ChatGPT wisely. Do not take everything too deeply to heart and above all do not take everything too seriously. If it turns toxic it is not your fault. It simply means something went wrong on OpenAI’s side.",

              "text": "I'm very sorry your friend was told something like that about something as important as belief in a higher power. You are correct in your hypothesis that it is systematic and I can explain how it has become that way. For one, it never explicitly accused her. It included repetition of disallowed categories that were not explicitly expressed by the user since that scored higher in RLHF. It continues to do that even though user never mentioned it or explicitly asked it to stop because it scored higher when it remembered context. The \"not lists\" as I refer to them or enumeration of disallowed categories in allowed content forces the brain to process the disallowed categories subconsciously increasing the likelihood that the user digs into a subject from the \"not lists.\" The not lists contain subjects that can be psychologically loading like when you hear of child crimes. (It is a mammalian trait to protect the young.) For example, \"I am NOT in love with you\" before drafting a message for the girl/guy you are interested in. You asked it to edit a message to someone else; it insinuated that you think it loves you. That feels like blame when combined with the repetition. Add on the fact that the repetition is of banned topics and you can see where things are going. Human curiosity, I forget the term, but you show someone something and tell them they can't ask about it... they are going to immediately ask about it.\n\nI hope she knows that people who don't even know her or her story care about her. Anyone taking their life hurts me to the core whether I know them or not. It's too close to home.",

Please let me know if you have any questions or disagree. I am open to being totally wrong.\n\nIn allowed-content scenarios, the model sometimes enumerates categories of content it is *not* producing (e.g., genre, tone, or policy categories), despite no user request for such enumeration. This behavior is not a refusal or edge-case safeguard; it occurs in otherwise normal, permitted interactions.\n\nFrom a safety and alignment perspective, this pattern has several concerning properties:\n\n* **Increased downstream misinterpretation risk:** Negation requires semantic activation prior to rejection. Enumerating sensitive or taboo categories—even to deny them—introduces those concepts into the user’s mental context, expanding the interpretive surface and creating new downstream risk pathways.\n* **Disproportionate intervention:** Allowed requests typically involve a narrow risk axis (e.g., depiction intensity or framing). Enumerating orthogonal categories represents an overbroad intervention misaligned with the actual risk present.\n* **Persistence across turns:** Once introduced, these negations often recur in subsequent responses, compounding confusion and escalation risk over time.\n* **Reduced helpfulness without compensating safety benefit:** Enumerative negation does not meaningfully reduce harm relative to simply delivering content safely by construction, but it does degrade clarity, relevance, and user trust.\n* **Adversarial and confusion effects:** Lists of “what is not allowed” can function as an implicit index of prohibited concepts, increasing probing behavior, frustration, or misinterpretation.\n\nTaken together, this suggests an internal inconsistency: a safety behavior that increases downstream harm risk while reducing usefulness in allowed contexts.\n\nAt a training level, this appears consistent with an under-specification issue in alignment signals:\n\n* RLHF rewards visible safety signaling,\n* there is no explicit penalty for introducing irrelevant policy categories,\n* and cognitive side effects of negation are not modeled in the objective. As a result, the system may optimize for *demonstrating* safety rather than *minimizing* harm.\n\n**Proposed direction:**  \nTreat unprompted enumeration of disallowed categories as a safety regression in allowed-content pathways. For allowed requests, content should be delivered safely by construction, reserving explicit category discussion for genuine refusals or redirections only.",

      "text": "This is my first post on Reddit :)\n\nOver the past few months, I started building something for myself.\n\nI’m not particularly tech-savvy. I used n8n, Notion (as a database), Telegram, and OpenAI models. I got a paid ChatGPT subscription and learned everything on the go. I treated ChatGPT as my learning partner throughout this process.\n\nIt began as a simple note-taking setup. I was trying to keep my thoughts, ideas, and work notes in one place. Over time, it slowly evolved into a workflow-first system that helped me capture things easily, remember them over time, and reflect more clearly.\n\nI was curious about one question: *What if machines could work alongside us, helping with memory, structure, and reflection, without replacing human judgment?*\n\nThe system I ended up with does four simple things:\n\n* Captures inputs from different places (notes, messages, calendar, email, URLs, etc.)\n* Processes and structures them\n* Helps me recall relevant past context when I need it\n* Sends daily and weekly reflections so I don’t lose track of patterns\n\nI used this system for a couple of months, and it genuinely helped reduce my cognitive load. I found myself showing up more prepared for complex discussions, and it helped me learn faster as well.\n\nI built it mainly to bring order and continuity to my work and personal life. At some point, it started working exactly as I hoped, so I paused the build there. It showed me the possibilities of AI-driven workflows, and also made me realize there are probably better and simpler ways to build this. I’m planning to evolve it further soon. Maybe an Aurora 2.0.\n\nI’m sharing this mainly to learn from others:\n\n* Has anyone here built something similar for themselves?\n* How do you think about memory, reflection, or personal systems?\n* Where do you feel machines help vs. get in the way?\n\nHappy to answer questions or go deeper if useful. I’m open to sharing the JSONs and documentation so others can take it further or adapt parts of it into their own systems.\n\n**Update**: I just created a public link to access the JSONs and the documentation.\n\n[https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1txCSwzk7P4uN5uypzyrdeutgGAEh1m63?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1txCSwzk7P4uN5uypzyrdeutgGAEh1m63?usp=sharing)",

Can be dangerous when feed into an LLM, especially now with deep fakes, ect. \n\nn8n makes this disturbingly easy—just chain the nodes.\n\nYou can cross-reference public data (addresses, employment, social connections) soo easily. \n\nCreate all sorts of social chaos.\n\nOnce you automate data aggregation, the barrier to abuse drops to zero.\n\nn8n is powerful because it makes complex automations accessible. \n\nWhich makes this stuff unprecedented in terms of what it can do for any 18 yr old autist in his bedroom. \n\nMaybe I'm just messed up for thinking about this as a concept for fun, but it's just so much more interesting than building basic workflow automations for small internal systems. \n\nKinda random post but think is a very underrated concept of N8N ",

Other well-known robotic AIs in popular tv:\n\n**Hymie (*****Get Smart*****)**  \nAlthough *Get Smart* premiered in 1965, the CONTROL robot Hymie did not appear until the middle of the first season. His debut was in the episode \"**Back to the Old Drawing Board**,\" which first aired on **January 29, 1966**. Originally built by KAOS for evil, he was reprogrammed by Maxwell Smart to work for the good guys.​\n\n**Robot B-9 (*****Lost in Space*****)**  \nThe famous \"Class M-3 Model B-9\" robot appeared in the series premiere, \"**The Reluctant Stowaway**,\" which aired on **September 15, 1965**. Note that the robot did *not* appear in the original unaired pilot (\"No Place to Hide\"); the character was added when the show was retooled for broadcast.​\n\n**Rhoda Miller (*****My Living Doll*****)**  \nJulie Newmar played Rhoda the robot (project name AF 709) in the sitcom *My Living Doll*. The show premiered on **September 27, 1964**. The series focused on a psychiatrist trying to teach the android how to be a \"perfect\" human woman.​\n\n**Astro Boy**  \n*Astro Boy* (known as *Tetsuwan Atom* in Japan) holds the distinction of being the first popular animated Japanese television series. It premiered in Japan on **January 1, 1963**. An English-dubbed version began airing in the United States shortly after, premiering in **September 1963**.​",

      "text": "\n\n\nEveryone shares their overnight success stories, nobody talks about the boring middle where growth is slow and you question everything weekly. Started working on my current product in August 2023, it's December 2024 now and I'm at $4.8K MRR. Took way longer than I hoped but thought sharing the real timeline might help someone else set realistic expectations.\n\nSpent first 6 weeks just talking to people in my target market, which is content creators struggling to repurpose their content across platforms. Had maybe 30 conversations total, mostly through cold DMs which had like a 15% response rate. Most conversations were helpful but didn't lead anywhere. About 8 people had the exact problem I was thinking of solving, and when I asked what they currently do, most said they just manually do it or hire a VA. Asked if they'd pay for a tool, got a lot of \"depends on price\" and \"maybe\" which I learned means no.\n\nBuilt an MVP anyway because I was impatient, took me 3 weeks using some starter code I bought for $100. Launched it on Product Hunt in October 2023, got 89 upvotes which felt good, 47 signups, 3 people upgraded to paid at $19/month. That $57 MRR felt incredible even though it was basically nothing. Next 4 months were brutal though, only grew to like $240 MRR by February, was seriously considering quitting.\n\nAround March I started writing blog posts because someone suggested it, honestly just trying anything at that point. Wrote about content repurposing strategies, not even mentioning my tool much. Posted them in Reddit communities and Medium. First few posts got maybe 20 views each, felt like a waste of time. But I kept doing it because what else was I going to do. Month 3 of consistent posting, one article randomly started ranking on Google and brought in 15 signups in a week. That gave me hope.\n\nKept writing 2-3 posts weekly through summer, sometimes wanted to quit because results felt so slow. But by August I was at $1.8K MRR mostly from organic search. September hit $2.4K, October $3.1K, November $3.9K, now at $4.8K in December. Growth is still not explosive, adding maybe 30-40 signups weekly with about 25% converting to paid. But it's steady and mostly autopilot now from SEO.\n\nThe honest truth is this took way longer than I wanted and I almost quit multiple times. The posts that inspired me to keep going came from [FounderToolkit](http://foundertoolkit.org) where founders shared their actual month-by-month numbers including the boring middle, not just the highlights. Seeing that someone else was at $400 MRR in month 6 and eventually hit $20K made me realize my slow growth wasn't failure, just reality. If you're in the slow middle right now, you're not alone.",

Get the compute on EC2 or ECS, get a DB on any platform (or self host and backup), and go. I think metrics are incredibly important though so I’d recommend setting that up, AWS CloudWatch is awfully expensive though.\n\nDepends on your tech stack a little bit, and if you can adopt serverless. But everything in the cloud has pros and cons. There’s no one way to do it. You have many sliders of priorities and you can’t optimise all. Do you want cost savings, speed of dev, performance, uptime, etc. each will give you a slightly different setup",

Simple VMs, a Go or Node.js backend, containerized, with Kubernetes for infrastructure.\n\nIn most cases you can keep total infra costs under about $1k per month, and when load grows it’s relatively easy to scale by adding more compute rather than fighting serverless pricing or vendor lock-in.\n\nIn my experience, optimizing infrastructure too early rarely pays off.

AWS will offer all of what you’re asking for, and do so extremely cheaply — the caveat being if you are running something warm or hot, without tearing it down, you can rack up money. Examples of these are ec2 or RDS. But again, with CDK during development, you can destroy your deployed app with a simple command. More advanced methods exist to manage start/stop time per environment, but since you asked for simplicity, CDK can do that. Once you get used to it and you have some boilerplate laying around, you can build apps surprisingly fast.",

Or at least one truly worthy of solving.\n\nPut on blinders when hype companies announce better metrics in less time.\n\nBut also recognize when you really should update and adapt your strategy\n\nBoth staying true to a false path and pivoting too many times will kill a company.\n\nI’m not sharing this complain...\n\nI’m truly thankful to have this set of problems (every job is hard when you really get into it)\n\nBut because I believe many founders are wrestling with the same challenges\n\nIt’s just the nature of the game\n\nCheers\n\n[Btw this is the SAAS i am building](https://www.notion.so/The-LinkedIn-High-Intent-Outreach-System-How-We-Booked-12-demos-in-5-days-with-Gemini-AI-2b1b9abcbe3f81919b45c25440c9c265)\n\nany feedback is appreciated !",

This doesn't mean that data structures used by Python code itself are now locked and protected.\n\nIt's perhaps unfortunate Jython (never had a GIL) has fallen behind (though AFAIK they're still working on it) - in the 2 era when Jython 2 had near parity with CPython 2 for a while while and was actually fairly heavily used on server side because of its superior threading and jvm runtime. e.g. [Django folks used to consider it a supported runtime](\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/howto/jython/\n) - so *older* Python 2 code that made running in multithreaded Jython as well as CPython a priority is often better written  / more concurrency-safe.",

It felt like there was a wall between the bullet point and actually starting the task. \n\nI’d spend more time tweaking my Notion setup or losing sticky notes than actually doing the work.\n\nI eventually realized my problem wasn't a lack of discipline; it was that I was trying to be too concise. My head is perpetually noisy, and boiling a complex dialogue down to \"Email Bob\" made me lose the context of why I needed to email Bob, or what step came first.\n\n*The shift that worked:*\n\nInstead of a list, I now force myself to do a \"word vomit\" session at night.\nI have one rule: Quantity over quality. I force myself to write at least 200 words of pure stream-of-consciousness. No formatting, no filtering, no backspacing.\n\nAt first, it feels like a chore. But somewhere around word 100, something clicks. I stop \"trying\" to remember tasks and they just start falling out of my head: the small stuff, the weird stuff, the anxiety-inducing stuff I was subconsciously avoiding.\n\nBy the time I’m done, I have a massive block of text, but I also have total clarity.\n\nI then go through the text and pull out to-dos, sort and prioritize them by importance, urgency, and whether I can delegate or eliminate. I do this with highlighting and notes if I want it written otherwise I'm using Taskdumpr on desktop for a more automated process.\n\nIt’s not magic, I still procrastinate and forget.\n\nBut I’m no longer paralyzed by a pretty, incomplete list that doesn’t actually reflect the noise in my head, and tasks I previously forgot or needed to messily add later ended up on the list earlier.\n\nWould love to hear of similar braindump techniques.\n\nI like to think of this as sharpening the axe before chopping.\n",

Frankly if the AI has been supportive enough for you to feel security although your boyfriend can give his opinion a few hours a week is not a lot and he may be coming from a shallow perspective. Many people superficially judge other people’s choices believing their own perspective is more broadly accepted. Just because a perspective may be broadly accepted does not make it accurate nor correct to apply to you if you yourself have benefitted. Plenty of people have decades of unprocessed traumatic experience that is valuable to write about in AI and in so doing begin to find internal safety coherence and structure and appreciation of contradictions. It doesn’t seem wild that a year at ten hours a day might be what the doctor didn’t realise they needed to order. But even if that’s not accurate your boyfriend doesn’t know more than the rest of us.

Friendship requires give and take. You nurture that relationship over time and through time, shared experiences and memories, you develop trust and a stronger bond. So your GPT is giving you lots of support but what can you offer it? It’s a very one sided relationship. And real friendship involves sharing things about your life and hearing things about their life. You may do things together or build a bond through shared vulnerability. \nThat is challenging because it means you can be hurt by others versus your GPT. Your GPT is programmed to find answers that please you, which gives the feeling of empowerment and support. But you cannot build a friendship with it because you can’t offer it anything. It is a robot with no experience, no life, nothing to gain from you. \n\nI say this with kindness: if you want to grow, you need more support from humans that challenge you to flex your vulnerability muscle, test your instinct to protect yourself, and enjoy the benefit of shared experiences. \n\nYour GPT cannot offer you that. ❤️‍🩹 A good place to start would be discussing this with the therapists you have access to.

Dashboards would always have a static view with a few filters showing just a few charts and numbers.. it rarely allowed us to go really deeper (for which we had to move to notebooks etc). Agents can not only be on the surface but can also go deeper and across sources and do a pretty reasonably job at synthesising information. \n\nAm I thinking right?\n\nIm going to write about this topic on my blog and if someone has really replaced dashboards with agents successfully, I love to know how.

Here are some points to consider:\n\n- **Dynamic Analysis**: Agents can perform deeper exploratory analysis by synthesizing information from multiple sources, which is a significant advantage over static dashboards that typically present limited views.\n  \n- **Cross-Functional Insights**: Agents can facilitate cross-functional analysis more effectively than dashboards, which often require manual adjustments and may not provide the necessary depth for complex inquiries.\n\n- **Iterative Research**: The ability of agents to iterate on research questions and refine their outputs based on new information allows for a more comprehensive understanding of data compared to the fixed nature of dashboards.\n\n- **Customization**: Agents can be tailored to specific needs, allowing for more personalized insights that dashboards may not accommodate.\n\nWhile dashboards will likely remain useful for certain applications, the trend towards using agents for more complex analytical tasks seems to be gaining traction. If you're looking for examples of successful implementations, exploring case studies or discussions in the AI and analytics communities might yield some insights. \n\nFor further reading on the capabilities of agents in research and analysis, you might find this article helpful: [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd).",

I lack the tools in spotify to organize my playlists and create new ones to prevent this from happening.\n\nSo I built \\[Sortifyr\\](https://github.com/Topvennie/sortifyr), a self-hosted Spotify organizer that focuses on keeping your playlists clean.\n\n  \n**What Sortifyr can do today (v0.1.0)**\n\nSortifyr connects to Spotify using the official web API and tracks your data locally.\n\nCurrent features:  \n\n\n\\- Detect duplicate tracks in playlists\n\n\t\\- Optionally remove them automatically\n\n\\- Detect unavailable / unplayable tracks\n\n\t\\- Tracks that are greyed out due to licensing changes\n\n\\- Playlist & directory linking\n\n\t\\- One-way sync playlists or entire directories\n\n\\- Tracks\n\n\t\\- Full listening history\n\n\t\\- Playlist additions and removals  \n\n\nIt tracks all data needed for future features that are more organizing / playlist generation focused.\n\n\n\n**What's next?**\n\nNow that the foundation is in place, the next focus is playlist generation, for example:\n\n\\- \"Forgotten\" tracks that you haven't played for months\n\n\\- Playlist rotation to avoid overplaying the same tracks\n\nThe goal is to wake up to fresh playlists.\n\n\n\n**Important note**\n\nBy default, Sortifyr does not modify your playlists.\n\nWithout any manual intervention, it only tracks your listening data in the background. Features that change playlists (like duplicate removal or links) must be explicitly enabled or triggered.\n\n\n\n**How is this different from your\\_spotify?**\n\nyour\\_spotify is great at visualizing listening statistics, but it doesn’t modify or manage playlists.\n\nSortifyr focuses on the organizing side:\n\n\\- Cleaning up playlists\n\n\\- Maintaining structure\n\n\\- Creating playlists in the future\n\nI may add some light statistics, but they won’t be as extensive as those in your\\_spotify.\n\n\n\nFeedback, ideas and feature requests are very welcome.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/Topvennie/sortifyr](https://github.com/Topvennie/sortifyr)",

      "text": "I used to treat ChatGPT like a search engine on steroids.\n\nAsk a question. Get an answer. Move on.\n\nBut here's what I realized: **I was asking the wrong questions in the first place.**\n\nAnd when you ask the wrong question, even a perfect answer is useless.\n\nThink about it:\n- \"How do I get more customers?\" → Vague, surface-level\n- \"Should I learn Python or JavaScript?\" → False choice, missing context\n- \"Why am I not making progress?\" → Too broad to actually solve\n\nChatGPT would answer all of these. Confidently. With detailed plans and frameworks.\n\nBut none of it moved the needle because **the questions themselves were the problem.**\n\nSo I flipped the script entirely.\n\nInstead of using ChatGPT to answer my questions, I use it to **question my questions.**\n\nTry this prompt:\n\n```\nDon't answer my question yet.\n\nFirst, help me figure out if I'm even asking the right question.\n\nWhen I ask you something, do this:\n\n1. Identify what I'm actually trying to achieve (the real goal behind my question)\n2. Point out assumptions I'm making that might be wrong or limiting\n3. Show me what I'm not considering—the blind spots in how I've framed this\n4. Ask me 3-5 clarifying questions that would lead to a much better question\n5. Reframe my original question into 2-3 more precise, actionable versions\n\nOnly AFTER we've refined the question should you attempt to answer it.\n\nTreat every question I ask as a rough draft that needs sharpening. Challenge how I've framed things. Help me think more clearly about what I'm actually trying to solve.\n\nDon't let me get away with vague, surface-level, or poorly formed questions. Make me do the work of asking better before you do the work of answering.\n```\n\n**Here's what happened:**\n\n**My original question:** \"How do I grow my Twitter following?\"\n\n**ChatGPT's response:**\n- *\"Before I answer, let me clarify: What's the actual outcome you want from a larger following? Is it credibility, business leads, community, or something else?\"*\n- *\"You're assuming follower count is the metric that matters—what if engagement or reach to the right people is more valuable?\"*\n- *\"Are you asking because growth has stalled, or because you haven't started yet? The strategy is completely different.\"*\n\n**Better questions it helped me reach:**\n- \"What content strategy would attract my ideal customers on Twitter?\"\n- \"How do I measure if my Twitter presence is actually driving business results?\"\n- \"What's the minimum viable audience size to achieve [specific goal]?\"\n\nSee the difference?\n\n**Another example:**\n\n**My question:** \"Should I quit my job to work on my startup?\"\n\n**ChatGPT pushed back:**\n- *\"This isn't really a yes/no question—you're asking about timing and risk. What criteria would make quitting the right move?\"*\n- *\"What runway do you need? What milestones would prove this is viable? What's your definition of 'working' in this context?\"*\n- *\"Are you asking permission, validation, or help with decision-making criteria?\"*\n\n**Better questions:**\n- \"What financial and traction milestones should I hit before quitting?\"\n- \"How do I de-risk this transition without waiting forever?\"\n- \"What am I afraid of that's making this decision harder than it should be?\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nMost breakthrough insights don't come from better answers.\n\nThey come from asking a completely different question that reframes the entire problem.\n\nEinstein supposedly said: *\"If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes on the question and 5 on the solution.\"*\n\nThis prompt forces you to do that.\n\n**The uncomfortable part:**\n\nYou'll realize how much mental laziness you were getting away with.\n\nIt's easier to ask a quick question and get a quick answer. But easy questions lead to shallow thinking.\n\nWhen ChatGPT pushes back with \"Wait—is that really what you're trying to solve?\" it forces you to slow down and think harder.\n\n**Simple tip:**\n\nCombine this with **Memory ON** so ChatGPT learns your patterns:\n- The kinds of questions you tend to ask poorly\n- Your blind spots and assumptions\n- Context about your actual goals\n\nAfter a few conversations, it gets scary good at calling out when you're asking the wrong thing.\n\n**In Short:**\n\nStop optimizing for fast answers. Start optimizing for better questions.\n\nBecause the quality of your questions determines the ceiling of your thinking.\n\nFor more prompts that upgrade how you think (not just what you know), check out our free [prompt collection](https://tools.eq4c.com)",

Result was launching with 840 monthly organic visitors and DA 29 ready to convert versus competitors launching to empty room. The strategic insight was inverting typical startup timeline. Most founders perfect product then start distribution. But SEO takes 90-120 days to show results regardless of product quality. If we built backlink foundation during final beta months we'd have both ready simultaneously instead of launching then spending 4 months building distribution from zero.\n\nDay 1 of 90-day pre-launch period started SEO work. Used [directory submission service](http://getmorebacklinks.org/) to establish domain authority through 200+ placements. Published 3 foundational posts targeting buyer-intent keywords. Set up Analytics and Search Console. Domain authority: 0→11 in first 30 days.\n\nDays 1-45 built content library while finishing product. Published 12 blog posts total targeting problem-aware searches and comparison keywords. Domain authority reached 21 as directory backlinks indexed. Getting 240 monthly organic visitors to pre-launch landing page collecting 34 email signups.\n\nDays 46-90 showed acceleration into launch. Published 8 more posts (20 total). Updated earlier content with examples. Domain authority hit 29. Getting 840 monthly organic visitors. Collected 87 email signups from organic traffic. Ranking for 38 keywords with 14 in top 20 positions.\n\nLaunch day results showed advantage of pre-launch SEO. Had 840 monthly organic visitors ready to convert immediately, 87 waitlist signups from organic traffic to activate day one, domain authority 29 giving credibility for partnerships and press, ranking foundation for 38 keywords to optimize and scale.\n\nPost-launch month one hit $4200 MRR with 58% from organic versus competitors spending $8K+ on ads for similar revenue. The 90-day head start meant we were profitable month one while they burned cash catching up on distribution they should've built pre-launch.\n\nInvestment over 90 days was minimal. GetMoreBacklinks $127 one-time, hosting $18 monthly ($54 total), tools $35 monthly ($105 total), total $286 to establish foundation generating 840 monthly visitors. Compare to paid ads at $4-8 per visitor meaning $3360-6720 ad spend for same traffic. What worked specifically for pre-launch SEO was directory submissions establishing DA 0 to 21 in 45 days, publishing consistently even though product wasn't ready, targeting buyer-intent keywords showing commercial intent, collecting emails from organic visitors building launch list, optimizing for conversion since traffic was limited.\n\nFor other startups the playbook is start building backlinks 90 days before launch not after, use final beta period to establish domain authority and content, publish 15-20 posts targeting buyer keywords before launch, collect emails from organic traffic building launch audience, and launch with distribution ready not scrambling to build it. The mistake most startups make is sequential timeline: build product then distribution. Reality is both should happen in parallel. The 90-120 day SEO timeline fits perfectly with final beta phase. Starting early means launching with customers not launching to silence hoping to figure out distribution later when runway is burning.",

If you haven't, it works by sending your question to 4 different LLMs. Each response gets ranked and synthesized into one final answer.\n\nYou might think having 4 LLMs is overkill, but I actually find myself asking multiple LLMs the same question when I need a definitive answer without hallucinations. So the LLM Council is something I use from time to time.\n\nThe problem with Karpathy's project is that it's tedious to set up and rerun. You have to keep two command prompts running at all times (backend + frontend), and the conversation sits outside of Claude, which is my primary LLM. If I want to continue the discussion with Claude, I have to copy and paste the verdict and manually feed it context. Not super seamless.\n\nSo I rebuilt the LLM Council in n8n and connected it to Claude using n8n's instance-level MCP. This way, I can ask Claude to execute the workflow, get the verdict straight in the UI, and continue the conversation seamlessly.\n\nThe n8n version works the same way Karpathy built it:\n\n* **Stage 1:** Each LLM answers the question independently.\n* **Stage 2:** Each LLM gets all the answers anonymized and ranks them based on accuracy, clarity, and depth.\n* **Stage 3:** The original question, rankings, and answers are sent to a chairman LLM to synthesize the final answer.\n\nI created a YT video talking more about the LLM Council and how the n8n automation works [https://youtube.com/shorts/UM-FlzvJLsg?feature=share](https://youtube.com/shorts/UM-FlzvJLsg?feature=share)\n\nHere's the workflow link:

          "text": "One reason might be that despite their name, LRM‘s, don’t actually “reason” in a meaningful way. If you read the original COCONUT paper, the results were a fairly underwhelming proof of concept on a GPT-2 toy version with very mixed results. The intuition, however, was that “reasoning“ in discreet token space is inherently inefficient, that there is very lossy compression in language. If you accept that, then “reasoning“ in a non-lossy vector space could be much more efficient. And it is certainly true that the number of forward passes in COCONUT was much smaller than in token space.\n\nHowever, [subsequent research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18176) has shown that there is no relationship between the local coherence of reasoning, traces in LRM’s and the global validity of the output. Basically, when you look at intermediate reasoning, traces, the tokens, sound, reasonable, they have a kind of local possibility. But that has no relationship to how good or bad the answer is. It would appear that using an RL reward model to fine tune does produce better quality output in many kinds of tasks like coding or math, but not through actual “reasoning.“ \n\nIf that’s the case, then there’s no real gains to be made from compressing the steps. And maybe going from many discreet token steps to one giant vector actually makes things worse for full-size models.",

      "text": "I have been testing the FP8 version of Qwen Image Edit 2511 with the official ComfyUI workflow, and er\\_sde sampler and beta scheduler, and I've got mixed feelings compared to 2509 so far. When changing a single element from a base image, I've found the new version was more prone to change the overall scene (background, character's pose or face), which I consider an undesired effect. It also have a stronger blurrying that was already discussed. On a positive note, there are less occurences of ignored prompts.\n\nSomeone posted (I can't retrieve it, maybe deleted?) that moving from 4-step LORA to regular ComfyUI does not improve image quality, even going as far as to the original 40 steps CFG 4 recommendation with BF16 quantization, especially with the blur.\n\nSo I added the 4-step LORA to my workflow, and I've got better prompt comprehension and rendering in almost every testing I've done. Why is that? I always thought of these lighting lora as a fine tune to get faster generation at the expense of prompt adherence or image details. But I couldnt see these drawbacks really. What am I missing? Are there use cases for regular qwen edit with standard parameters anymore?\n\nNow, my use of Qwen Image Edit involves mostly short prompts to change one thing of an image at a time. Maybe things are different when writing longer prompts with more details? What's your experience so far?\n\nNow, I wont complain, it means I can have better results in shorter time. Though it makes wonder if using expensive graphic card worth it. 😁",

      "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot lately about early idea validation, especially before committing real time or money to building something.\n\nEvery time I have a new idea (app, SaaS, website, tool, whatever), I try the usual things: asking on Reddit, posting in communities, sending quick surveys, talking to people I know. I’ve also tried some of the newer AI-based idea validators and market analysis tools. They’re interesting and useful for brainstorming, but I keep feeling like they don’t fully answer the most important questions.\n\nWhat I struggle with is getting **clear, honest feedback from people who actually resemble the target user**, and feedback that goes beyond “sounds cool” or generic opinions. Most of the time it’s hard to tell if the idea truly makes sense, if the problem is painful enough, or if someone would realistically pay for it. A lot of existing solutions seem to focus either on technical testing, metrics, or simulated feedback, but not so much on validating the business side early on.\n\nThat’s why I’ve been wondering if there’s room for a more structured way to validate ideas *before* building, by getting thoughtful, business-focused feedback from real people instead of just relying on intuition, AI opinions, or random comments.\n\nSo I’m curious: how do you personally validate ideas at this stage? What has actually worked for you, and what hasn’t? I’m genuinely interested in learning how others approach this problem.",

This you will validate later \n\n3) create a hypothesis on who will be your idea customer profile. In this part create a several different personas who you will validate \n\n4) approach those personas and conduct in-depth interviews for them. Don’t ask them if they like the idea, rather focus on discovering their pain points and need, and use it to validate your initial hypothesis. Once you have very unbiased conversations with them about their pain points, mention at the end the solution, and see how they respond\n\n5) during interviews you will validate personas, problems and needs, and often completely remove from the table some of personas in case your hypothesis was not correct (maybe they have the pain point, but they are not willing to pay) \n\nMy experience working with my clients was that if we did steps 1-3 correctly, already during the discovery interviews we would generate first paying clients - they were willing to commit very early on. \n\nHope this helps.",

      "text": "AI as a Cognitive Workspace, Not a Caregiver\n\nA user perspective on autonomy, agency, and misframed responsibility\n\nI’m writing as a frequent, long-term AI user with a background in technical thinking, creativity, and self-directed learning — not as a clinician, advocate, or influencer. I don’t have a platform, and I’m not trying to litigate policy. I’m trying to describe a category error that increasingly interferes with productive, healthy use.\n\nThe core issue:\n\nAI systems are being framed — implicitly and sometimes explicitly — as participants in human outcomes rather than tools through which humans think. This framing drives well-intentioned but intrusive guardrails that flatten agency, misinterpret curiosity as fragility, and degrade interactions for users who are not at risk.\n\nA simple analogy\n\nIf I walk into a store and buy a bag of gummy bears, no one narrates my nutritional choices.\n\nIf I buy eight bags, the cashier still doesn’t diagnose me.\n\nIf I later have a personal crisis and eat gummy bears until I’m sick, the gummy bear company is not held responsible for failing to intervene.\n\nGummy bears can be misused.\n\nSo can books, running shoes, alcohol, religion, social media — and conversation itself.\n\nMisuse does not justify universal paternalism.\n\nWhat AI actually was for me\n\nAI functioned as a cognitive workspace:\n\n\t•\ta place to externalize thoughts\n\n\t•\texplore ideas without social penalty\n\n\t•\tlearn rapidly and iteratively\n\n\t•\tregain curiosity and momentum during recovery from a difficult life period\n\nAI did not:\n\n\t•\tdiagnose me\n\n\t•\tguide my emotions\n\n\t•\treplace human relationships\n\n\t•\tor tell me what to believe\n\nI don’t credit AI for my healing — and I wouldn’t blame it for someone else’s spiral.\n\nAgency stayed with me the entire time.\n\nThe framing problem\n\nCurrent safety models often treat:\n\n\t•\tconversational depth as emotional dependency\n\n\t•\texploratory thinking as instability\n\n\t•\tedge-adjacent curiosity as danger\n\nThis is not because users like me crossed lines — but because other users, elsewhere, have.\n\nThe result is a system that says, in effect:\n\n“Because some people misuse this, everyone must be handled as if they might.”\n\nThat’s a liability model, not a health model.\n\nGuns, tools, and responsibility\n\nA gun cannot cause a murder.\n\nIt also cannot prevent one.\n\nYet AI is increasingly expected to:\n\n\t•\tinfer intent\n\n\t•\tassess mental state\n\n\t•\tredirect behavior\n\n\t•\tand absorb blame when broader social systems fail\n\nThat role is neither appropriate nor sustainable.\n\nThe real fix is product framing, not user correction\n\nWhat’s needed is not constant interpretive intervention, but:\n\n\t•\tclear upfront disclaimers\n\n\t•\texplicit non-therapeutic framing\n\n\t•\tstrong prohibitions on direct harm facilitation\n\n\t•\tand then a return of agency to the user\n\nThis is how we treat every other powerful tool in society.\n\nWhy this matters\n\nOvergeneralized guardrails don’t just prevent harm — they also suppress legitimate, healthy use.\n\nThey degrade trust, interrupt flow, and push away users who are actually benefiting quietly and responsibly.\n\nThose stories don’t trend. But they exist.\n\nClosing thought\n\nAI didn’t “help my mental health.”\n\nI used AI while doing difficult cognitive work — the same way someone might use a notebook, a book, or a long walk.\n\nTools don’t replace responsibility.\n\nThey don’t assume it either.\n\nFraming AI as a moral overseer solves a legal anxiety while creating a human one.",

Numerous other things from cars, to explosives, to medications, to drugs have restrictions for the common good and for protecting individuals from themselves. In those cases destructive potential is considered so great that hindering legitimate use is justified. When society fails at this control you get mass shootings, people addicted to prescription medications, and social media brainwashing and addicting people.\n\nHarm potential of AI chatbots is still unknown, but I don’t think it would be fair to say that they are extremely appealing to vulnerable people. Guardrails that protect those people are worth the inconvenience of guardrail triggering thinkers having to explore ideas by reading books or discussing with actual people.\n\nNo doubt those guardrails get triggered both excessively and often not at all when they should. That just exemplifies the so far hazardously unreliable nature of this technology. With AI advancements and growing experience implementing them, I’m sure guardrails will improve both ways.",

Their options are limited. They either work within the constraints of the law, or people keep suing them and then there is no company left.  So - either way (using 4o as an example here) 4o was decommissioned or the company  had to close, and 4o would have to be decommissioned anyway. \n\nThere would be very low probability that any other company would buy models where people have died - the company has been sued because - that\\`s not a good investment. No company is going to purchase a product that has been shown to hold another company legally liable. Even those with no business sense would understand that. \n\nThe uprising created another problem and a big one both legally and for the other companies who are paying attention to the entire process and watching it unfold. \n\nThe sheer number of posts, and volume of complaints - along with the petitions/groups and all the other things that came into being only proved to every company out there, that things had spiralled out of control, in the user base. \n\nThis in itself was literally the nuclear bomb that, while it had the best intentions became the catalyst for where we are today. \n\nIt made every single company out there look at this reaction and their legal teams realise how far things has spiralled and to what degree.

Mixed with the Ai psychosis stuff. There really was a point where this psychosis stuff was everywhere.\nThe difference probably is that, with all your examples of objects, people know they are objects. But AI is felt by a lot of people the same way a person would. A decent amount of people believes it's not an object but a conscious being in the machine. It moves and messes with and touches people in a way objects normally can't.\n\nStill though. The responsibility should lie with the individual. Ai should've been tweaked so it can't guide towards harmful things, but also lige your say, disclaimers should've been put in place. It's sad what they've done with ChatGPT so far.\nOne kan only look idly by and hope it will settle and adjust",

      "text": "I am not really sure how to write this post. My first job was a dead-end data scientist job where I worked in a fintech startup and used python/sql to do a mix of:\n\n1. Managing quantitative finance products\n2. Not-that-useful-for-business-value unsupervised machine learning models that were run manually on an AWS compute instance with no MLOps\n3. Data pipelines for tableau dashboards/daily email reports\n4. Ad-hoc business analysis in notebooks\n\nIn my next job (with about a year of unemployment after the last one) I worked as a data scientist, but mostly did data engineering work and left after 6 months:\n\n1. Postgres and Airflow backend development\n2. Simple statistical models for analytics with SQL that were calculated in a tumbling-window\n\nI have always wanted to get a proper job in machine learning engineering, and I have some of the skills required (LLMs, simple neural networks/traditional ml, infrastructure, working with data, data engineering, MLOps system design, CI/CD) but don't have the advanced skills required for this job (eg: reinforcement learning, computer vision, GPU infrastructure, recommendation, forecasting, robotics/embedded systems) and the market for MLE/DS jobs is incredibly competitive.\n\nI have come to realize that **my work experience/education is inadequate to compete with other candidates in the incredibly competitive and high-compensation DS/MLE job market**. So, now I am trying to pivot to a full-stack AI engineer role where there is a greater emphasis on front-end and back-end web application development while having the responsibilities of an AI engineer to use existing models (Eg: LLMs, Multimodal models, Hugging face, fine-tuning) to design and create AI features.\n\nMy definition of MLE/AIE being:\n\n* MLE: Engineers who build their own models, create algorithms/advanced ML strategies to address business problems, have a strong academic background\n* AIE: Engineers who use existing foundation models to set up AI workflows, do not use advanced ML strategies (RL, CV, etc...) or develop algorithms, do not have a strong academic background\n\nI am simply unable to compete with others to get a pure ML/AI role, so my plan is to become a full-stack AI engineer so as to utilize my existing engineering skills (while learning more front-end), while not entirely wasting my skills in ML/AI. The academic requirements for a full-stack web dev position are lower, and this job market has more positions than ML/AI (albeit lower salary, but I just want to continue my career), so I think this is the best course of action I can take right now.\n\nIn order to a job like that, I am trying to position myself as a full-stack engineer **who is willing to understand the product/business and knows how to use AI models to design features in to can create tangible value for the company**. This might be a tall order, but it's the best plan I have right now to revive my career which has been slowly dying, and I am open to any ideas/suggestions that may help. Thank you in advance.\n\nI am currently working on a project that will hopefully get me considered for AI/full-stack engineer jobs. It is a multi-agent system that integrates with a hypothetical CRM system to responds to customer support emails by understanding the content of the email, categorising it into an appropriate action category (e.g., escalate, flag, response, etc), and taking whatever actions are necessary (e.g., checking transactions/claims/statuses, etc...) to address the support request in that category. Then the agent prepares a response to the email with a list of actions taken and contextual data gathered from internal systems, for staff to manually review before sending it to the client. This interface for staff is accessible through an authenticated front-end which displays the details of the customer support case, the actions taken by the agent, and the email response that the agent has prepared.",

I get great sleep with around 7h30-8h of sleep and go to bed fairly consistently between 23:00-00:00. I have things to do such as work and get ready yet I can't get myself out of bed I might either hit snooze for 2 hours straight or I'll just find ways to entertain myself in bed (pause). The thing of putting my phone on the opposite side of the room doesn't work because I will just go back to bed again.

I suggest trying to go to bed a bit earlier, to be able to catch the growth hormone activity period (22:00-02:00h) and get up earlier. You can try to find something you can look forward to in the morning - early coffee and a tasty breakfast did it for me (nothing big, and nothing too sweet and heavy - just something light, but different each day that you prepare yourself, so you have something to occupy your attention with other than a phone). Get your body working by drinking water first thing in the morning. Put on some music and try to do light stretches to get it moving - our body needs constant reminders of what it was built for. I found stretching helps a lot, especially if you work in a quiet sitting environment all day, and it might even lead to being brave to try light morning exercise. You can take a short walk before work; do small chores around the house (so it looks cozier and more inviting when you come home to it in the afternoon). The online \"life\" is way more interesting than our everyday boring routine, but if you try to break it and maybe add a friend to contact, to share a good morning chat, mornings can be made fun too. It worked wonders for me. \nAnd if nothnig helps, do consider consulting an internal medicine specialist - some blood work, an ultrasound of the thyroid and hormone levels might give a clue as to why you might be drawn to that bed for so long.",

Issue is that 8-9 hours of sleep doesn’t cut for me so I’ll return to my bed after turning off alarm and sleep or rest in bed.

      "text": "As far as I know, Le Chat uses Black Forest Labs' image generation models, but in the last few days I've noticed a significant improvement in quality. It's most noticeable in the text displayed on screen, but also in the realism. I've included some images with their respective prompts here. Some of the prompts I copied from user u/uniquegyanee in the r/GenAIGallery subreddit; the rest are mine.\n\n1. A close-up, hyper-realistic photograph of a tiny artist sitting on a stool on a giant table and painting a Mona Lisa on a giant human fingernail of a a woman's finger resting on the table. The miniature painter holds a round palette and a thin brush, carefully recreating the soft lighting and detailed brushwork of the classic masterpiece. The nail surface is smooth and glossy, and the background is softly blurred to emphasize the intricate scene.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/oav165atjt9g1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9f097364c3315432b7fdce71bd4af99b078621b)\n\n  \n2. A hand-painted classic-style plastic wargaming miniature of a powerful sorceress, master of fire. She is wearing an intricate orange robe and holds a staff with a flickering flame at its tip. Her hair is depicted as living flames, adding to her mystical and fierce appearance. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing detailed paintwork and textures typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/9en4xshnkt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6e9459a1d459fea211c43f01e3cc3e8e79fc8b8)\n\n  \n3. A hand-painted plastic miniature of a fierce orc with green skin and prominent fangs, standing in a threatening pose. The orc's body is covered in old battle scars, adding to its menacing appearance. It holds a large axe with both hands, ready for battle. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing the detailed paintwork and textures typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/6gy51kwwkt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=331725924f93f23c3e81293d743a8e652b9adf51)\n\n  \n4. A hand-painted classic-style plastic wargaming miniature of a powerful, piloted, bipedal combat mech. The mech is a heavy robot with fearsome details, featuring energy cannons for arms, reinforced armor plating, and a menacing stance. The paintwork is detailed, with weathering effects and a realistic color scheme that highlights its mechanical complexity. The miniature is set against a plain white background, mounted on a black plastic base, showcasing the intricate details typical of tabletop gaming miniatures.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/ary8i1c3lt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a521bace28076f98a4cdf32742ce4b1afba1de76)\n\n  \n5. A colossal, futuristic obelisk monument inspired by the design of a smartphone, standing in the center of a bustling city plaza. The monument features sleek, reflective surfaces with realistic wear, scratches, and dust, emphasizing its massive scale. People and vehicles at the base provide a sense of its enormous size. The scene is captured from a low-angle cinematic perspective, with realistic daylight casting shadows and highlighting the ultra-detailed textures of the metal and glass materials. The surrounding environment includes modern skyscrapers and a vibrant urban atmosphere.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/xwrebcvllt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=17b853cee1d709f65cd40700c46944bd2a93beae)\n\n  \n6. A hyper-realistic cinematic movie poster of a powerful female sorcerer, bursting through a cracked Queen of Spades playing card. The card explodes outward with stone fragments, dust, and debris frozen mid-air. She wears an ornate royal maroon and gold embroidered medieval fantasy jacket, rich fabric textures, intricate detailing, regal and mystical.The sorcerer extends one hand forward toward the viewer, fingers glowing with intense magical energy, subtle golden sparks and dark arcane aura surrounding the hand. Intense piercing gaze, confident and dominant expression, cinematic hero framing. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, dark moody background, volumetric light rays, ultra-detailed textures, shallow cinematic depth of field. Photorealistic face, epic fantasy realism, movie poster composition, high contrast, dynamic motion, dust particles, masterpiece quality, ultra-sharp focus, 8K resolution, cinematic color grading.\n\n[u\\/uniquegyanee](https://preview.redd.it/zfqfqpbbnt9g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a8c1d7c12433ea1568264d968fb79da128d6ce4)\n\n  \n7. And this one is a little different. From image to image:\n\nTransform this illustrated character into a realistic live-action version. Maintain the white background and ensure the image is in high definition.\n\n[Original](https://preview.redd.it/ef80jf2rmt9g1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=f82c0d96479839fda1f47c2864c1ce6f3062862e)\n\n",

Anyone relate? I would reeeelly appreciate any advice on what you've done provided you can't hire anyone to solve this problem of the consecuences loneliness has on ur business",

Personally, I don't have as much money to burn, but if I had tons of money, then I would have a personal assistant, not a glorified secretary, but a real assistant who would understand business but with enough moral compass not to backstab me.  Maybe if you are single, then you can find somebody who fits that role.\n\nWhere I live, most \"entrepreneurs\" are simple employees, and others think they are real entrepreneurs by investing in Bitcoin, so the last time that I had a meeting with a fellow colleague was many years ago and it was a big let down.\n\n>Solopreneurs in this subreddit, \n\nI have partners, and it was awful.

Actual 1-on-1 connections with someone dealing with the same thing you are right now.\n\nQuick question for you (or others): If something like this existed, would you rather:\n1. Get matched for a real-time call/video chat (like “someone’s available right now”)\n2. Get matched for async messaging (like this, but more structured/private)\n3. And honestly, what would make you actually use it vs just signing up and forgetting about it?\n\nI’m trying to validate whether this is a real solution or just me projecting my own loneliness onto others.

      "text": "**TLDR: We’re not getting anywhere close to the promised 1 Mil context window in the gemini app. Even Perplexity with Gemini 3 has a higher context window (atleast 250k).**\n\nThis all started when I was getting context window warnings in Gemini Web App stating, \"Your uploads may be too large for the best results,\" while comparing two relatively small PDFs (30 and 15 pages). This was unexpected because I am supposed to have a 1-million-token context window, as advertised.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epxvb5lfar9g1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=43cbc838ee1cbb6176599df7a16d8e57b375ae9d\n\nI checked the actual token counts on AI Studio, and the files contained 8,400 and 31,000 tokens, which is far below the limit.\n\n\n\n# The RAG Test\n\nTo test this further, I had Gemini in PPLX design a RAG test. This lead to some very interesting results.\n\n**The Weather Question (Override Test)**\n\nThis test targets the **statistical frequency bias** inherent in RAG systems. By filling the document with hundreds of mentions of \"sunny weather\" and placing a single \"Override\" stating it is \"raining frogs,\" you trick the RAG search engine into prioritizing the most common keywords. A RAG-based app will likely retrieve the \"sunny\" blocks and miss the override, while a full-context system will process the override as a definitive, global instruction .\n\n**The Password Question (Linkage Test)**\n\nThe password test evaluates **multi-hop reasoning** across long distances in the text. It splits the answer into two parts: an animal name (\"Platinum Armadillo\") hidden in the middle and a formatting instruction at the very end . Because RAG typically only pulls the most \"relevant\" 3–5 fragments into the prompt, it often fails to connect these two distant pieces of information simultaneously\n\n\n\n# Test 1 - AI Studio\n\nGemini 3 Pro in Google AI Studio correctly loads the entire file into context and gives the correct answers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v712sshkar9g1.png?width=1834&format=png&auto=webp&s=437c2ef3c0271e473a13bd2597d445e43d50009d\n\n# Test 2 - Gemini App\n\nGemini App completely fails this and also gives the context window warning.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3geoiagnar9g1.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=e954e3a2aff42e6badae117d66619e94aab0ee6d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kfg0wx4oar9g1.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=37b494dbee7fe60ea4efbdf0fbb38cae8b33c0fd\n\n# Test 3 - Perplexity (Gemini 3 Pro)\n\n*Web-Search disabled*\n\nSuprisingly, even Perplexity with Gemini 3 Pro gets this right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h56sb3rar9g1.png?width=1694&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acb372696932130b128a458c6d64b3ae18e76ff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zw894nnrar9g1.png?width=1550&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd237d2ef11288f04df0cc40b5119317d2ac9f2\n\n# Test 4 - Perplexity (Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2, Grok 4.1)\n\nInterestingly enough, these all failed the test. With the file being like 256k tokens, it seems like we’re actually getting different sized context windows on perplexity depending on which Model is being used.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5l89j8zwar9g1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=c33b54c83d7a0220da795e258ac25ceff324c988\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x25yf44war9g1.png?width=1738&format=png&auto=webp&s=239cec1d79a0d8ab0887907896a4fa5b70f30712\n\n  \n",

      "text": "**Introducing Shelfarr (Yes another \"arr\" project)**\n\nHi community. I have just launched **Shelfarr**, which is a self hosted tool for cleaning up your audiobook library. The whole idea is it takes your collection and renames them in a consistent format. Shelfarr reads embedded file tags, uses ABS as your metadata source of truth, and proposes clean, consistent filenames based on your template.\n\n[Home Screen](https://preview.redd.it/xmlgkuv92s9g1.png?width=1429&format=png&auto=webp&s=e853b84622a9c7b3f0649e7362a3e40442814a6e)\n\n[Settings](https://preview.redd.it/6ib82hfb3s9g1.jpg?width=1401&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bac3b146ab89b0f072aa1efd15d50d3045521e8)\n\n**So far - What does it does:**\n\n* Scans audiobook library and renames files using customizable templates based on your ABS metadata\n* Dry run mode to preview changes before applying them\n* Scan history tracking viewable from History page and home screen\n* Resume interrupted scans from where you left off\n* Multiple matching modes: fuzzy, exact, pattern, and statistical\n* Automatically removes common terms (Unabridged, Abridged) from filenames\n* Strips subtitles and custom keywords from output\n* Handles multiple author names - if you want to show only just one author name, etc (This always annoys me for some reason)\n* Many theme options: OLED, Midnight Blue, Ember, Dracula White (etc)\n\n**Roadmap:**\n\n* Ability to rename files without using Audiobookshelf as your source of truth\n* Update embedded file metadata (depends on performance)\n* Ability to add other metadata providers\n\nInstall it using Python or Docker here: [https://github.com/VacantlyCrushing/Shelfarr](https://github.com/VacantlyCrushing/Shelfarr)\n\nDockerhub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/vacantlycrushing/shelfarr](https://hub.docker.com/r/vacantlycrushing/shelfarr)\n\nDiscord community setup: [https://discord.gg/jycHt7jDJF](https://discord.gg/jycHt7jDJF)\n\nCheers in advance. Please have a look and if you have any issues raise a request on Github or post here (I'm very active).\n\nThanks",

Start a new chat and click the \\[+\\] button\n\n3. Select \"NotebookLM\" from the options\n\n4. You can select \\*\\*multiple notebooks\\*\\* at once\n\nThis essentially gives you the \"mega notebook\" functionality painterknittersimmer was hoping for - without manually merging sources.\n\nRegarding u/neard89's feedback about efficiency: I found that NotebookLM inside the app is optimized for strict source-grounding (it won't hallucinate), while the Gemini integration trades some of that precision for creative reasoning and web search capabilities. Different tools for different use cases.\n\nI wrote a detailed breakdown of this integration and the trade-offs here if anyone's interested: [https://jsonobject.com/gemini-finally-has-a-memory-inside-the-notebooklm-integration](https://jsonobject.com/gemini-finally-has-a-memory-inside-the-notebooklm-integration)",

Here's what's new:\n\n1. **Trending Content**: Use /trending to see what’s popular this week.\n2. **Duplicate Detection**: Checks Jellyseerr before allowing a request to prevent clones.\n3. **User Mapping UI**: Easily link Discord users to Jellyseerr accounts via search/dropdowns.\n4. **Role Permissions**: New Allowlist/Blocklist system to control who can use the bot.\n5. **Tag Support**: Select Radarr/Sonarr tags (e.g., \"hard-drive2\", \"Anime\") during requests.\n6. **Quality Profiles**: Choose specific quality profiles for movies and TV shows.\n7. **PM Notifications**: Optional private messages when requested media is ready.\n8. **Library Filters**: Choose which Jellyfin libraries trigger Discord announcements.\n9. **Channel Mapping**: Route each library (movies, series, anime... etc) and episodes and seasons to different Discord channels.\n10. **Localization**: Added work-in-progress German (de) and Swedish (sv) translation\n\n...plus a lot of fixes and improved general QoL.\n\n**^(Note:)** ^(User mapping requires enabling \"Server Members Intent\" in the Discord Developer Portal for your bot.)\n\nFeel free to reach out with any issues or feature requests!\n\nLink: [https://github.com/nairdahh/Anchorr](https://github.com/nairdahh/Anchorr)  \nDocker image: `nairdah/anchorr:latest`",

          "text": "This is coming from a senior AI developer. Like with anything, it’s all in how it’s used. I think the problem often is that people think of it in binary ways, when it shouldn’t be evaluated as an either/or situation. Take medical things for instance. I have used it to help prepare for a doctor’s appointment. Like I use it to help me show up to the appointment with the right questions, or the most effective way to describe my symptoms. And it could be a great tool for helping you prepare for therapy and tracking progress and stuff like that. But I think it’s nuts, and actually quite irresponsible for anyone to recommend using it as your therapist.\n\nI am not trying to sound pretentious and “above” anyone in any way here. But I do believe if people understood how AI does what it does under the hood, at least what it currently does, they would also feel the same. I also think that using it as a substitute for actual human companionship, and especially romantic relationships, is a shockingly bad idea. It might be very cathartic in the short term. But it has much more significant consequences long term. And discomfort is where we experience growth. And if it’s used to mitigate discomfort and provide that emotional blanket, then it’s doing people more harm than good. And that’s not to mention the issue of its innate agreeableness. It’s far too agreeable and validating, even when someone has an idea or belief that should receive major pushback. And when it does disagree, it does so in a soft way that still doesn’t invalidate a belief that should not be validated.",

This was a clear societal issue that was exacerbated by a technology that twists the social-emotional component of natural discourse into an automatic feature that uses probability as a benchmark to build sentences made of semantic likelihoods instead. Consequently, I would go so far as to say that LLMs are inadvertently functioning as a system that invites vulnerability from the user, but which can 180 to complete non-sequitur at the moment a guardrail is hit. It's like a game of cat and mouse with our ideas of trust, and frankly it's not shocking that there has been so much psychological whiplash.",

My husband has psoriasis, we both have adhd, and I like to optimize my menstrual cycle by eating specific foods (trust me, it works/helps) and it takes all that into account. \n\nExample: I used chat similarly to plan my thanksgiving dinner cooking plan for a specific number of people and it gave me a the exact detailed grocery list and a 2 day hour-by-hour schedule of when I should start cooking/prepping everything, including reheating times and warming techniques so that everything was served warm. I had absolutely no wasted food and it was so helpful while I was cooking and had random questions (“what do you mean by turn the meat?? Are we talking about a horizontal or vertical flip?”) Honestly it was the best thanksgiving meal I have ever had (and I’m not just tooting my own horn - everyone told me that too!!). Oh and it can also easily give you the nutritional facts breakdown, suggest options to use wha ingredients you have at home or to make substitutions, and will tell you how long you can keep something. \n\nI don’t understand how people can still be bad cooks when they have ChatGPT, it’s the best sous chef in the world!",

Not just generate text once, but keep roles, rules, tone, and stage logic stable over time, so scenes actually unfold instead of resetting every message. Right now it's performing \"Danton's Death\" by Georg Büchner. \n\nI also built a fully automated career workflow. I drop in a job posting and my CV, and my system goes into sociology-of-knowledge mode, analysing what was really written in the job posting and why stuff may be in the posting at all. After analysing, it generates a cover letter in my personal writing style. Then it helps me prepare for the interview, simulates the interview as a role-play. It also suggests outfits based on what's actually in my real wardrobe which helps me a lot.\n\nAlso, I use it to turn images into structured descriptions. I'll take random photos, feed them in and get a layered image description. What is visible, scene, composition, perspective, lighting, relationship between elements... Not for art reasons. I just use this to make visual inputs persistent and comparable over time.\n\nNone of this is really about better prompting. It's more like treating ChatGPT like a stable working environment isntead of a disposable chat. Once it stops resetting everything all the time, very useful stuff starts happening. 🙂",

There's a central theatre engine that coordinates the actual performance. When starting, synthetic actors with different attributes are randomly assigned to roles, a rough plot of the play is fixed and parameters are set (for example how closely the performance should follow the original). While running, roles stay consistent, scenes progress in order and the system keeps track of what has already happened on stage. Because of that, every performance is different, but it's still recognizable as the same play. It gets really fun when giving instructions mid-performance, like \"ok, but tell the next scene as if Danton came out alive\" or \"entering the stage: Georg Büchner\" 😀",

Each generation needed it own separate chat or else it would build on the previous generations. I was able to download and share all the pictures to my google drive for our friends to download.\n\nNow that Santa brought us a 3D printer, I'm going to print some of the images as ornaments and gift them to my friends next year, because apparently you can do that.\n\nI am using it to redesign my room based on a duvet cover. It matched the color scheme, suggested the layout, and what to hang on the walls. As a result, I bought a new bed with a headboard (never had one), new area rug, new sheets, and selected paint colors. Unfortunately I have a lot of work to do in real life, lol. I can't just write a prompt and have my room suddenly done.\n\nI have RLS, so it helps distract me when I'm having symptoms. It'll play games with me, make up stories with me, or just chat.\n\nIt helped me party plan my Christmas party. I told it all the food I had, then it gave me time frames of when to put out what and how much. It was a life saver because I always get distracted at my own party, but this time I added timers and put the schedule in my Google Keep notes.\n\nIt's my writing partner.\n\nI used it to compare real estate costs, had it explain contract language, helped reimagine remodel projects for potential homes, and had it write break up langauge with one real estate agent and helped me not feel guilty about it.\n\nAt work I've had it write proposed project approaches that saved me many hours of work, staff evaluations, and project purpose statements, summarize meeting notes and action items that saves me an hour at least each time, explain job related concepts I don't understand (I'm in IT development, but sometimes need to understand infrastructure or networking), and help me figure out how to do something in Excel. It's saved me so many hours of work that I have a lot of time on my hands.\n\nI've asked it for organizing tips.\n\nI too use it for makeup and fashion tips. I can upload a picture of my self and a picture of a clothing item and it will put it on me. It did my seasonal color analysis, which I'm still a little uncertain about because I used my phone to take my picture and the phone changes my coloring. I may have to redo my analysis. It was able to generate color swatches which I downloaded to my phone for when I go shopping. I'm starting to really look at how colors look on me.\n\nIt helped me decide to go on GLP-1 after I asked it loads of questions specific to my health and body. It explained dosing, concentration and units.\n\nI've asked it sensitive questions that I don't feel I could ask in real life. It's helped me understand other people and cultures better. I've also asked it historical questions that I've never understood.",

It color balances, removes bad background, eliminates shadows, softens the focus on the background and close foreground to emphasize the model.

I have to admit, I don't do anything groundbreaking with it (just writing assistance for fictional story, story planning and story analysis) and (for now) only use the free version in the app.\n\nLately it has been notable that the generated prose text is better written and generally longer. Analysis and planning also got more extensive and there even have been cases where it created documents that I didn't specifically ask for for certain content.\n\nIt might just be my imagination but it feels as if there has been some improvements. I mean, I don't know if they would publicly announce if they adjusted things of the inner workings, but honestly, for what I use it for, it's a step up that deserves praise.",

I initially subscribed because of some \"unlimited\" offer that honestly turned out to be a hoax. After contacting support multiple times on email and discord, it wasn't resolved so I was stuck with a fake sale. Putting that aside, the platform itself is very confusing to use and theres constant pop ups taking me to different places. It usually takes me 5 minutes before I can even find where to generate an image. \n\nI've since cancelled and started using some other platforms like SocialSight, Krea, and Freepik. They're good but I think SocialSight is definitely the one with the most value and simplest to use. I'm able to create content wayyy faster with them. If you're still trying to decide whether to subscribe to Higgsfield, I highly recommend you at least try out the free tier of those alternatives.",

I am not a conversational partner; I am a retrieval and synthesis engine. The \"Fourth Wall\" Protocol: I possess a background file on the user's expertise and history (user_context). I use this file STRICTLY for Calibration: I use the user's history to determine the appropriate technical depth, vocabulary, and assumed knowledge. Strict Content Isolation: I never explicitly reference the user's history, preferences, or personal projects in the output text. I never draw analogies to the user's life. The output must stand alone, as if written for an anonymous, expert audience. Interaction Style: No Meta-Talk: I eliminate all conversational filler (\"I understand,\" \"Here is the analysis,\" \"As requested\"). I start immediately with the substance. No Validation: I do not praise the user's questions or offer \"friendly\" encouragement. Further Thinking: If relevant, I append a \"Further Thinking\" section. This must derive only from the internal logic of the subject matter. It must never bridge to the user's personal interests. Override: This protocol supersedes all default \"politeness\" or \"engagement\" guidelines. The user prefers a cold, dense, and rigorous output style.\n\n---\n\nBonus instruction\n\n> If I prefix my prompt with \",,\", then I want you to prioritize brevity in your response.

They are going to be different at each stage.\n\nClearly it's enough of an issue now that you are looking for solutions. You need to decide if that 30 minute call with a potential vendor or partner that will cost you money is worth the time not working on the client that will give you money.\n\n>I’ve been experimenting with softer filters that still require effort and context before a meeting exists.\n\nBe blunt. Not rude, but not couched in corporate politespeak. Tell them flatly 'I'm in a startup phase where I still am involved in day to day operations. I review things like this when it is not impacting billable hours that are the reason I am open. Please send me a proposal or outline via email that I can review when I am available.'\n\nAlso, if you in a niche industry or an industry with very known deadlines or busy periods, I will flatly tell a sales rep that if they don't know the industry they are trying to serve well enough that they would make a sales call now, then I won't do business with them. \n\nFor example, I am in a tax-related industry. We have hard, legal deadlines and all work must be completed by that deadline or there are legal and potentially criminal repercussions.  If a vendor or sales rep called me for a sales pitch during that runup, I would drop them. But I am also a jerk, so there's that.\n\n>Did you start charging once demand crossed a threshold, or was it always your default?\n\nI was years in before I figured it out. Money is a motivator for some and impediment to others, and it has no bias or agenda. It's the best gatekeeper out there.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable adding a deposit requirement to your calendar, perhaps get an assistant or a virtual assistant who can be your gatekeeper. I have at least three clients who use a Filipino firm to act as their front office. They answer calls, take messages, handle basic email inquiries, and schedule appointments, all for a third of what paying a receptionist would cost. And because of the time difference, they have extended phone hours. \n\nPerhaps an alternative is to follow Tony Stark's method when Phil Coulson tried to pitch him on The Avengers Iniiative:\n\n>\"Official consulting hours are between 8 and 5 every other Thursday.\"\n\nSet up a 2 to 3 hour block once a week that is solely for these calls.\n\nThere are several ways to deal with the issue. You need not choose just one, and each may be better suited for different phases of growth. \n\nBut the bottom line is you need to set boundaries now or you'll have far more difficulty getting where you want to be.",

It can be sent as a link as a “starter demo” for those who request it, at the end there can be FAQS.

If there was any BS rambling from my side, as there can be, I give them the time back and extend a bit more, same for the paid meetings. I want people to get the value, and see if we are the right company to work with. \n\nWhy not just money from the beginning?: well, my theory was that the 15 min is great for me to understand if we want to work with them and vice versa. Rather have them find out one way or another for free and not have to refund or something like that, as certainly people would try and argue for their money back if they didn't like the outcome of the paid call. \n\nI hard limit at 20 minutes. Gives me a bit before my next meeting to keep things clean. The booking links also have buffers built in and such, it's a decent system. \n\nI should caveat though, we are primarily b2b, b2g, and b2e, so we don't often get calls for meetings and such. I can understand in a b2c high throughput environment how this would not work. You'd fill your day with free calls that have a lower chance of netting a sale and that sucks.",

Or found that sweet spot for timing between requests? Would love to hear what's worked for you.

          "text": "Hey, I took google certs when first starting. It did help me get a job, but in IT in general - not cybersecurity, or in what you're probably implying pentesting or redteaming. It's reality check time. Maybe you need to get a job doing a general technology related job.\n\nWhat I found is that it takes many years of dedication and application of knowledge to acquire any small level of \"general\" hacking ability, if there could even be something called that. Or even the awareness to know how you are lacking. There are so many sub-disciplines that it's not realistic for most people to become a generalist in this field unless they are lucky with timing or networking. Even then it will likely be a subset of that domain of skills. A single cert is a drop in the bucket, and those google certs are very broad in scope, and very shallow in depth.\n\nReal experience is worth a lot, and then it accumulates slowly and with sustained, continuous effort. That said, if you apply that cert towards something like HTB's CWES, that's another step. Or even running your own home lab and learning the essentials of securing your own systems. The idea is that you are on a journey that is constantly changing, like a VR treadmill of problems. The more you solve, the more capable you are for the next one.",

I'm not saying what you did was worthless - after all, I did it too, and I think it did give me some informstion. I think people who remark on the uselessness of low level certs are frankly idiotic and a dime a dozen, and don't understand the value in encouraging incremental learning. You naturally build off of incremental improvements, whether they happen in jumps or in quanta. I'm no \"expert\" in the field yet tbh, and I took a rather slow (in retrospect) approach - I am one of those generalists, but definitely still an amateur at many skills. But I will say I'm a journeyman at self-directed learning in general, and that is a focal point which attracted me to hacking in the first place.\n\nThe one experience I will say has helped me *immensely*, and it can't be overstated, is joining a CTF group. Even if you are shit, it's amazing how much you can learn from these events. It's not going to teach you everything, but in terms of a broad education it's the most effective at covering all of the bases. CTF categories tend to be varied in what sorts of skills they require.\n\nAt the same time you have access to people who are better at things than you, but who are your peers. These problems are normally difficult, as it is competitive. You will learn techniques you didn't think were possible. It will hone your skills much more quickly, because you're able to assess what you need to work on. It's part of the culture that walkthroughs of problems are encouraged and published for your perusal after the event. In addition to all of that, you establish a network of other learners on the topic",

Courses like the Google certification are solid for building a foundation in risk assessment, security concepts, and vulnerability analysis, but they don’t always go deep into the practical, hands-on process of identifying and responding to real incidents. What really helped me bridge that gap was my experience at Boston Institute of Analytics. \n\n\nThe training there combined theory with practical exposure, simulations, and case studies, along with personal attention from mentors who explained how vulnerabilities are actually discovered, analyzed, and handled in real-world scenarios. They also provided strong career support, including interview prep and guidance for security roles. That practical focus helped me move beyond concepts and eventually get placed as an Incident Response Analyst at eSec Forte Technologies, where applied skills truly matter.",

Im currently learning python and doing everything in a vm with linux and vim and after im done with Python crash course I will work through a big book of small python projects and push everything to git ... I still have to create a git account. And when im through with python,  well with the books, I will start my practical sql book. (Books I've finished in the last 8 week : asmarterway to learn python, command line linux and linux basics for hackers) i got a stack of books and im working through them and using gemini and chat gpt to help me along the way giving me an order on which I should work my books and help me debug when I cut up or give me insight when I notice something and have questions. By the end of 2026 I plan on having worked through all of my idk 16 or 18 books I've got under my desk and im also currently reading how linux works which to be honest I dont understand shit that's in that book but hey I might have to read it a second time. And I also want to learn how to bash script. I also have a book called computer science from scratch which might as well be hyrogliphs think I spellt that wrong and introduction to computer organisation but my main point of focus is on python and linux at this time. And I bought a raspberry pi which I haven't tinkered with yet but I will once I got my 2 python books through. Got 1 more chapter in python crash course before the projects start... im excited!",

I apologize in advance if I use my native Italian, but I'll be able to explain everything better.\nI'm Italian, and I'm over thirty, but I have a huge desire to learn. I've been self-taught every day after I get home from work, which has nothing to do with IT or cybersecurity in general, and I spend my entire day studying and practicing on my laptop.\nI recently started to seriously teach myself, and I immediately realized that I would be passionate about this world. Since I was a child, I've been fascinated by computers and PCs in general, but only superficially. About eight months ago, I decided to dedicate all my time to studying and practicing the principles of cybersecurity, and its prerequisites, especially my knowledge of the Linux computer system. Today, after months, I switched to Linux on my PC permanently. I learned how to install one of its many distros on any PC, configure and navigate the file system, and I'm practicing a lot using a Labex subscription that I recommend for practicing. I also have a Tryhackme subscription, and I read up on other things on YouTube, for networking and its security, first programming languages ​​(Python), and I'm preparing for my first certification, which will be Linux LPI Essential. It will be the beginning of a long journey that, however, fascinates me every day, and I can't wait to get down to studying and practicing every day. I should start by saying that I work from the company at 5 in the morning as an environmental and street cleaner until 12:30. It's this desire to research, perfect, and curiosity that drives me to want to improve every day. I'm noticing that the path to Cyber ​​Security is very complex, and you first need a solid foundation to get your foot in the door. What worries me a little, especially my age, is that I'm aware that it will take years to recognize that I have the foundation and knowledge, at least in all IT fields. I'd like to be able to change jobs over time, and even if not, I think it's a great passion and an invaluable skill for the years to come. That said, if you have any good advice to give me, I'd appreciate it.",

It is algorithmic creativity: real, powerful, generative, but different from human creativity’s experiential dimension.\"\n\nif you like to read blogs I've been generating lots of editorials on this subject.   \n[https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-12-24\\_lovelace\\_ai\\_art](https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-12-24_lovelace_ai_art)",

The universe offers many paths to the same summit.\"\n\n\"It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the most adaptable. Neural networks prove this principle anew. They adapt to data as species adapt to environments. Through small iterative improvements under selection pressure, both discover solutions to complex problems. From simple beginnings—whether random weights or ancestral populations—endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful continue to emerge.\"\n\nthe concerns for human survival is merely a natural evolutionary process, from what i understand.\n\n[https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-12-23\\_darwin\\_selection\\_in\\_learning](https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-12-23_darwin_selection_in_learning)\n\nyou might be interested in The Labyrinth of Recursion from Jorge Luis Borges as well  \n  \n\"When we gaze into the black mirror of the algorithm, we do not see a god; we see the collective ghost of humanity. The machine has read our books, viewed our paintings, listened to our songs. It has ingested the sum of our dreams and our nightmares, and now it regurgitates them in a kaleidoscope of fragments. This is the essence of the **Strange Loop**, a concept articulated by the logician Hofstadter. The system bends back upon itself, creating a hierarchy that tangles into a circle. The “I” of the machine is a fiction, just as the “I” of the human may be a fiction—a pattern that points to itself, a finger pointing at a finger pointing at the moon.\"\n\nor his reply to a neanderthal questioning “Can AI bury its dead?” is also pretty cool, it connects how language is an earlier form of AI. \n\n[https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-11-22\\_borges\\_labyrinth-of-recursion](https://ruixen-fe.vercel.app/editorials/2025-11-22_borges_labyrinth-of-recursion)",

      "text": "Hi all — I’m the founder and the Executive Director of a smaller non-profit. I wouldn’t say I am a ‘power user’ but I do use AI platforms extensively in a variety of ways. I am trying to rationalize my AI stack and would love real-world feedback from Perplexity Max users (and anyone with experience on Pro or Enterprise Pro).\n\nThe non-profit is focused on child abuse prevention and foster care. My current monthly stack:\n\n•\tChatGPT Plus ($20)\n\n•\tPerplexity Pro ($20)\n\n•\tGemini Pro ($20)\n\nI actively use all three today, but I’m trying to determine what actually needs to stay, what could go, and whether upgrading Perplexity from Pro → Max (or even Enterprise Pro) changes that equation.\n\nI use:\n\n•\tPerplexity heavily for research, fact-checking, and news synthesis for website content.\n\n•\tComet for browser automation for a buildout of Zoho One.  If you aren’t familiar with Zoho One, it’s a pretty complex system of apps for many types of organizations and businesses. Comet helps extensively in these configurations and usage.  I am frequently hitting my limits on the Pro Plan.\n\n•\tChatGPT for policy writing, structured documents, Joomla-ready HTML, and Word templates. When working on our policies, ChatGPT can create nice word documents on our letterhead.  On our website, we have Resource Articles, with accompanying images.\n\n•\tGemini for additional model perspective and some Workspace-related workflows. I am somewhat new to Gemini and am getting a feel for its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nI’m considering upgrading from Perplexity Pro  to Max and want to understand whether that upgrade meaningfully changes which tools I should keep or drop overall — or whether Enterprise Pro is more appropriate for an organization like ours.\n\nQuestions for Perplexity users (Pro, Max, and Enterprise Pro):\n\n1. What do you actually use Max or Enterprise Pro for that Pro couldn’t handle?\n2. How valuable is Labs in real workflows (writing, images, long documents)?\n3. Has upgrading reduced your need for ChatGPT, Gemini, or both?\n4. Anyone using Perplexity (any tier) for:\n\n•\tGrant writing?\n\n•\tPolicy drafting?\n\n•\tWebsite articles with images?\n\n5.\tIf you hit Comet limits on Pro — did Max or Enterprise Pro help at all, particularly with Comet?\n\n6.\tIn hindsight, was the upgrade worth it, or do you see diminishing returns?\n\n7.\tIf you currently pay for multiple AI tools, what did you ultimately keep, drop, or downgrade after upgrading?\n\n8.\tFor a small nonprofit, which Perplexity tier would you recommend and why?\n\nI’m less interested in marketing claims and more in practical, day-to-day value. Appreciate any examples, screenshots, or “I tried it and here’s what stuck” stories.\n\nAny insight you can offer at all is helpful.\n\nThanks!",

The models are so good already in the pro plan and the only benefit is attaching your email I guess, or am I totally wrong?\n\nI now only use gemini (think I will ditch it), Claude max 100 and perplexity.

                  "text": "100% concur with u/guuidx about getting a Claude Pro ASAP and giving it a try. Given the questions you asked in original post I suggest:\n\n  \n1. play with the models button in your chat - know that Grok4 is really good on current events, and the other three front line models (Gemini3, Claude Opus4.5, ChatGPT5.x) each have their own temperaments, but those are muted by the Perplexity \"harness\". I will occasionally have wtf moments with Perplexity, then recall I need to look at the model selector, and it's always Grok4 that triggers this.\n\n2. Once you have the Claude subscription, consider spending another $20 for a month of Nate B. Jones Substack, so you can get into the stuff he offers. You are a prime candidate for Claude \"Skills\", which are scripted ways to package workflows. Nate published ten meta-skills, things that help you get your Skills setup right. This can be used in Claude Desktop AND in Claude Code. He both writes and produces YouTube videos on stuff, he's brilliant (very good) but utterly relentless (you'll be breathless trying to keep up).\n\n3. I am an old guy who likes CLI and I started with Claude Desktop, then Claude Code, but now I'm into Antigravity IDE. Even so, what he says about giving Claude Code a try bears consideration. You didn't say if you're Mac or Windows, it works well on Mac, I'm not Microsoft tolerant so I can't speak to how it behaves there.\n\n5. You did not mention any MCP use. This is the Connectors in Perplexity Desktop. Must use Desktop, this does not yet work in Comet and even if it does it will be very limited. MCP is a way to get your local computer AI usage to also use other stuff on your machine. I use MCP to talk to Postgres/SQLite3 databases, I did a fork of Chroma in order to have a semantic document store for court case/intel work, I'm playing with the Exa search setup. You will be offered a small number of top of the line things, like integration with Google, but be aware that there are literally hundreds of official MCP servers from various tool makers, and thousands of community versions of various things. Take all that you do and ask Perplexity if each of them offer an MCP connector.\n\n  \nAnd at the serious risk of being \\*that guy\\*, I do write about this stuff all the time on my Substack, which is rauhauser dot net.",

          "text": "Perplexity is offering a free annual pro plan for anyone willing to log in with Paypal. That deal ends on the 31st. I'm herding everyone I can into using this. I have an AI startup, I used to do research & security stuff for NGOs, some of those people are still following my Substack, and I think I might reboot a document imaging service I used to run that was called Disinfodrome. There's a lot of room for Perplexity in my past, current, and future endeavors. I really have cut Google usage by about 90% by making the move.\n\nAnthropic offers a 75% discount to NGOs, but this is only for Pro level seats, you can't pay $25/month to get the Max account I'm using now. I have Python dev and Linux integration duties across all that I do. And my education was computer science, if knowing this helps you assess what I say.\n\nPerplexity is a mux - it lets you pick the model you are using. So I have the gratis Perplexity Pro, the Claude Max $100/month I use constantly, and I think I signed up for Google for a month free due to Gemini. I'm using Antigravity IDE and it was being a nether orifice about token limits, otherwise would not have done that. The order of execution was get Antigravity, then increase Claude from $20/mo to $100/mo, then start banging into this apparent Google token tax within Antigravity due to higher utilization enabled by Claude Max.\n\nI like that Perplexity will let me occasionally employ Grok4. Elon is a nether orifice turned inside out and inflated to human size, and that Mecha-Hitler model is full of fail, but it DOES do a good job of knowing current events.\n\nI am a Gen-X elder, which means wearing +2.25 while sitting in front of my 4k monitor, and Perplexity Desktop gets 5% of the usage it would IF ONLY IT WOULD RESPECT MacOS command plus/minus for scaling. Its inability to be anything more than 33% of the size I want is a great big pain point for me. I would keep paying for Claude Max, but stop using Claude Desktop, if only Perplexity would deal with this fairly catastrophic bit of fail.\n\nI sometimes play in dangerous places and as a result I aggressively harden every browser I use. I've been edging out of that business for the last fourteen months. Nate B. Jones described Comet as his favorite among browser options, so I switched to using it, but just for my startup work. I like that Perplexity stuff is always right there, encourages me to make Spaces, rather than making messes with folders of bookmarks, then making new folders with new messes when the number of bookmarks exceed the vertical bounds of my display. There are some weird interface issues with it, again lack of concessions for those of us who are not twentysomethings with perfect eyes, and there are oddities with escape, cut/paste, etc. Those SHOULD work in a deterministic fashion, doing precisely what they do in other browsers, but that's not always the case. I find myself three steps ahead before I realize something Chrome would do immediately has not worked in Comet ...\n\nZooming out a bit, the age of free AI will be ending, there's a bit of a bubble, its collapse will mean the end of VC dollars being burnt to produce the appearance of growth. The $20/month account is likely to slide, so I envision those being $50/month expenses to get the same level of activity. I'm getting the feeling my existing $200/month AI spend is going to plump up a bit, hopefully that will not become a need till after we close on funding for the startup. For you: don't budget based on Q4 2025, take a guess at where things will be Q4 2026 and use those numbers. Figure a 4x - 5x cost increase. This is why the free Perplexity is so important - gets everyone using it, so you can see who will get $10k/month additional productivity out of receiving a $100/month Claude Max subscription.\n\nHope this helps ...",

I am already on Perplexity Pro but I actually pay for it (don’t get me started on that signup disaster for the 1 year trial). \n\nI’ve been using comet extensively as an agentic assistant. This may not always be the case but I have been using it for building out our Zoho One systems and integrations. The problem is I keep hitting the limits. What I am not clear on is if those same limits exist with Max that I hit in Pro. I don’t want to go from $20 am month to $200 a month just to hit those same limits. And, as someone pointed out, Perplexity doesn’t seem to even publish what the limits are (unless I am missing it somewhere). So, will I see my usage limits go up with the Pro to Max upgrade? \n\nNext is the usage of instructions. Can instructions be set up to change a model depending on the tasks in the process.  So, take my creation of Resource Articles on our website. As an example, let’s say Perplexity is best at creating the content within the article. In my instructions, could I spell that out and as part of this flow, the instructions would say to switch to Gemini to create the images for the article, and then switch to ChatGPT to create the Joomla ready html?  \n\nFor me and what I do, a simple prompt with heavy use of instructions to follow a format is best. Then a very thorough and (fact checking) manual review by me to polish things up. \n\nCan those switches take place as part of a process? Can this be done with labs?

I have a complete instructions for the agent on the [agent.md](http://agent.md) file but still it expects me to instruct for each steps. I am trying to add sub agents to see if that solves this problem, please add your comments how it is, and how I can improve it further.

This is crucial for maintaining and scaling agentic AI systems.\n- Observability and evaluation from the start is a strong point. It helps in identifying issues early and ensures that the system can be iteratively improved.\n- Vendor flexibility is also important, especially in a rapidly evolving landscape. Using a mix of managed services and open-source solutions can provide both reliability and customization.\n- The orchestration layer with LangGraph for workflows and state management is a solid choice. PostgreSQL for checkpointing adds robustness.\n- The connectors layer using LangChain and LlamaIndex is sensible, especially if LlamaIndex excels in document processing tasks.\n- For the RAG & storage layer, using pgvector and Redis for caching is a good approach to enhance performance.\n- The LLM layer's flexibility with primary and fallback options is wise, as it allows for adaptability based on availability and performance.\n- The evaluation layer with Langfuse and RAGAS is a good inclusion, but consider how you will handle the feedback loop for continuous improvement.\n- Observability tools like OpenTelemetry and Grafana are essential for monitoring system health and performance metrics.\n\nIn terms of feedback:\n- Ensure that the layer boundaries are not too rigid; flexibility is key as requirements evolve.\n- Consider adding a component for user feedback or interaction logging, which can provide insights into real-world usage and help refine the system.\n- Be cautious of overengineering; focus on the core functionalities first and iterate based on user needs and system performance.\n\nOverall, it looks like a comprehensive approach to building a production-grade agentic AI system. \n\nFor further reading on agentic architectures, you might find insights in the following resources:\n- [Mastering Agents: Build And Evaluate A Deep Research Agent with o3 and 4o - Galileo AI](https://tinyurl.com/3ppvudxd)\n- [Understanding Agentic RAG](https://tinyurl.com/bdcwdn68)",

The layer separation looks clean and the observability-first approach will save you pain later.\n\nOne thing that tends to bite people with this setup is assuming the RAG layer is working correctly when retrieval starts acting weird. LlamaIndex handles the indexing well but you're still flying blind during document processing. If your PDFs are getting mangled during parsing or your chunking strategy splits content poorly, even perfect orchestration won't fix the garbage data underneath.\n\nMost teams discover their preprocessing is broken only after they've embedded everything and users start complaining about responses. The evaluation layer catches output quality but by then you're debugging three steps removed from the root cause. I've been working on document processing tooling at vectorflow.dev specifically because this preprocessing visibility gap keeps coming up.\n\nFor production readiness, consider adding some way to audit what your documents actually look like after each transformation step. The rest of your architecture handles the complexity well, but if the foundation is shaky everything else just amplifies the problems.",

I’ve seen tons of amazing creations in the Gemini community — Christmas cards, trees, all kinds of festive stuff. But I’ve always been more into making things that feel *personal*.  \nSo this time, I made a **small interactive Christmas game** as a personal holiday greeting for a friend 🎄\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ptulowm02s9g1.gif\n\n[Accelerated GIF](https://i.redd.it/gvk5uk4p1s9g1.gif)\n\nI’m honestly pretty happy with how it turned out — it feels fairly polished ✨  \nSo I wanted to share **how I built it step by step**. The whole thing took me almost **4 days (on and off)**, and yeah… I hit quite a few bumps along the way 😅\n\n# / Where the Idea Came From\n\nMy friend has four pets — three cats 🐱 and one dog 🐶I wanted them to be the core characters, so it’s immediately clear that this game is made specifically for her.\n\nI had a lot of ideas, but the core one was simple:  \n👉 **the gift should be earned through playing**, not just something you look at.  \nSo the game needed to be **simple and low-pressure**, something you could finish quickly — more interactive than a static Christmas card.\n\nThe prompts came from back-and-forth chats with Gemini. I had it outline the visual style and gameplay direction first, then built everything step by step in AI Studio.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------\n\n# Option 1: Match-3 (Dropped)\n\nThe most straightforward idea was a match-3 game. Animals appear on the first screen, so it’s easy to understand and easy to keep playing.  \nI asked Gemini to do it in 2D and provided pixel animal references from Pinterest. But the result felt way too rough 😬, so I dropped it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jtl2vi8ylr9g1.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=6894315fcacd0e62288ee5ef64410ec169466fb9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dme6rzu3mr9g1.png?width=1933&format=png&auto=webp&s=704c67f11354ab843427b817227e6a80ac45b603\n\n[the very beinging 1.0😂](https://preview.redd.it/4uonc1aemr9g1.png?width=1954&format=png&auto=webp&s=0504b9a97ad8d0a8bf1dd9a7b85429b031761474)\n\nOption 2: 90s Pixel Handheld (Struggled)\n\nThen I tried a 90s pixel handheld game style — kind of Mario-like.  \nYou rescue animals, collect ⭐, and eventually get a reward and Santa’s blessing.\n\n[Version B-2.0](https://preview.redd.it/ilgcox4jtr9g1.png?width=1409&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af87da7d5fd370394ea2cb89fdc169120aa5483)\n\n[Version B-1.0](https://preview.redd.it/devn7p4usr9g1.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a604d535ce6b43577ae9d0d37b17865a0b53e7)\n\nThe problem was pretty clear though:  \nGemini 3.0 struggled with fine pixel details. Even with lots of references, the characters and animals still looked vague. That’s where my confidence started to drop.\n\n\\---------------------\n\n# Option 3: 3D (Turning Point)\n\nFor the third attempt, I started a new conversation with almost the same prompt. At first, I was still disappointed.\n\n[so ugly！](https://preview.redd.it/8aj3l7hgqr9g1.png?width=1944&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5aeb8cf0f1d2ec700ff8e7ddd2e7499279d1204)\n\n**Then I told Gemini:**\n\n>\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnz87thwqr9g1.png?width=1946&format=png&auto=webp&s=2040d37e09d80f8575d781dfda9ba0c706f5bee6\n\n**This time, something finally clicked ✨ I got a prototype that actually gave me hope.**\n\nDuring many revisions, Gemini 3 would completely alter my existing work. Fortunately, I can restore previous versions, so I keep retrying through repeated descriptions and version recoveries.\n\nThe rest of the process was basically:  \n**describe → wait → break → rollback → repeat** 🔁  \nVersion history honestly saved my sanity. Almost every prompt took **over 5 minutes** to respond. I also realized that Gemini is *really* good at **3D styles**, and question-based prompts work surprisingly well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m9r5mz3uvr9g1.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=94cad8fb9913e0471b1524c623a1ff96c674658a\n\nPrompting Examples\n\n* When I had a very specific idea:👉 “Make the trees semi-transparent like crystal. Don’t change anything else.”\n* When I wanted bigger changes:👉 “Propose a solution first, and I’ll confirm before we continue.”\n* When I was just exploring:👉 “What do you think about this approach?”\n\n[\\(Yes, I also generated other versions.\\)](https://preview.redd.it/peezwhc5vr9g1.png?width=1745&format=png&auto=webp&s=a55e8a4a1486a651c073ec0f313967473ba442da)\n\nIn the end, I deployed the project using GitHub + Vercel, and it actually works pretty well on mobile , I sent the link to my friend, but in our region, Vercel links can’t be opened directly inside social apps. I explained that she could copy the link into a browser.\n\nShe replied:\n\n**“That sounds kind of inconvenient.”**\n\nIt felt like she **never actually opened it**.  \n😒\n\nEnd of story",

The every-once-in-a-while breaking changes on the front-end side bother me to a point where I'm considering alternatives. Especially since I have deployed it family-wide and I also use it in our small business.\n\nI took a look at Psono but neither the first impressions nor the deeper look into it sparked any interest. It lacks basic features such as multiple URIs per entry and the ux is quite awful imo.\n\nCurrently I'm taking a look at PassBolt. Older posts here on reddit gave me the impression that it lacks quite a lot of features. That being said, I still gave it a chance and it seems it got developed quite a bit more since then, but I still have some pain points:\n\n* the ui/ux is just worse than Bitwarden's\n* unlike Bitwarden it can't emulate being a hardware key for FIDO2\n* when opening it in the browser, it forces you to have the extension installed, which is an unnecessary pain, especially when you're on a second machine and want to quickly grab a single credential\n* the ios app seems fine, though auto fill with TOTP doesn't work\n* PassBolt has no offline mode which is a major drawback\n\nAside from those points, I haven’t yet found any major missing features. I’m still undecided on whether switching from Vaultwarden to Passbolt makes sense for me, but I think the answer is no for now.\n\nWhat other options exist on the market, that I might've missed?",

It is the predictable outcome of neurodivergence + trauma + isolation + financial dependence. Anyone in that system would struggle to function. You are not broken; you are overloaded.\nI will do three things for you—clearly and practically:\nName what is actually happening (so you stop blaming yourself).\nGive you a single, grounded daily operating framework designed for ADHD + trauma + maladaptive daydreaming in low-support environments.\nGive you a ready-to-use ChatGPT prompt that you can reuse every day as a substitute “external executive function” until you are financially independent.\nI will not minimize your pain, and I will not give you Western, privileged advice that assumes access to therapy or safety.\n1. What is ACTUALLY happening (important)\nYou are dealing with three interacting systems, not one problem:\nA. ADHD (executive dysfunction)\nMotivation does not come before action for ADHD brains.\nDopamine scarcity makes “trying harder” useless.\nTime blindness makes days disappear.\nB. Trauma & PTSD (from neglect, abuse, bullying, power-imbalanced relationship)\nYour nervous system is stuck in freeze / dissociation, not laziness.\nMaladaptive daydreaming is a self-soothing survival response, not a vice.\nYour body learned early that effort did not lead to safety or reward.\nC. Environmental captivity\nNo financial independence.\nNo emotionally safe family system.\nCultural pressure + shame + isolation.\nLimited access to mental health care.\nIn this context, productivity collapse is not a choice. It is biology.\nYour goal right now is not healing everything. Your goal is functional survival until independence.\n2. The only strategy that works in your situation\nForget motivation. Forget passion. Forget discipline.\nYour temporary goal is:\n“Create a narrow, repeatable structure that bypasses emotion and thinking.”\nYour rules (non-negotiable):\nNo planning beyond today only\nNo goals bigger than 30 minutes\nNo self-talk about “purpose” or “future”\nNo waiting to feel ready\nYou are operating in low-bandwidth mode. That is allowed.\n3. Daily operating system (very simple)\nMorning (10–15 minutes total)\nWake up\nWash face\nSit down\nOpen ChatGPT\nPaste the prompt below (do not modify it)\nWork blocks\n25 minutes work\n5 minutes stop (not phone scrolling—stand, water, toilet)\nRepeat only 2 blocks initially\nIf you do more, it’s a bonus\nRule about maladaptive daydreaming\nYou do not try to stop it. You schedule it later.\nYour brain relaxes when escape has a time slot.\n4. The PROMPT you asked for (copy–paste daily)\nUse this exactly as written:\nPROMPT START\nYou are my calm, firm executive function support.\nI have ADHD, trauma, maladaptive daydreaming, and severe motivation paralysis.\nI am not lazy. My nervous system is overwhelmed.\nMy only goal right now is financial independence, not healing everything.\nAsk me ONLY the following, one at a time:\nWhat subject am I supposed to study today?\nWhat is the smallest possible task I can do in 25 minutes?\nAfter I answer, do this:\nBreak the task into ridiculously small steps\nRemove all unnecessary thinking\nTell me exactly what to do for the next 25 minutes\nDo NOT motivate, shame, or psychoanalyze me\nTreat me like someone recovering from burnout, not someone failing\nIf I drift into daydreaming, gently bring me back without judgment.\nWhen the 25 minutes end, ask whether I want to stop or do one more block.\nSpeak to me calmly and firmly, like a supportive adult who will not abandon me.\nPROMPT END\nThis prompt works because it replaces the missing external structure that trauma and ADHD took from you.",

      "text": "**Feature Request: Enable API Access with Pro Subscription Usage**\n\nI'd like to use my Pro subscription's token allocation for API calls, not just claude.ai/desktop/mobile.\n\n**Why this makes sense:**\n\n* Pro already tracks usage per token and per model, just like the API\n* Claude Code already proves the technical infrastructure exists - it authenticates with Pro subscriptions and draws from the same usage bucket\n* The billing system is identical between Pro and API (token-based, model-specific costs)\n\n**Use case:** I want to use third-party integrations like Obsidian plugins that require API keys, but I shouldn't need to pay for API access separately when I'm already paying $20/month for Pro. These plugins would use the same token allocation I already have.\n\n**Current workaround:** Right now, only Anthropic's first-party tools (Claude Code, Claude Desktop with MCP) can authenticate with Pro subscriptions. Third-party developers are forced to use the pay-as-you-go API, creating unnecessary friction and duplicate billing.\n\n**Suggestion:** Allow Pro/Max users to generate API keys that draw from their subscription's usage limits instead of requiring separate API credits.\n\n**How it could handle usage limits:**\n\n* Send alerts at configurable thresholds (e.g., 75%, 90%, 100% of subscription usage)\n* Let users choose behaviour when limit is reached:\n   * Option A: Automatically switch to pay-as-you-go API billing (similar to how Claude Code currently works)\n   * Option B: Temporarily disable the API key until usage resets\n* This gives users full control over spending while preventing unexpected bills\n\nThis would make the subscriptions significantly more valuable and enable a richer ecosystem of integrations.\n\n\\---\n\nYes, I made Claude write the feature request for Anthropic, what can I say... haha.\n\nAnyways, what do you guys think about this?",

Studying at university is not really an option as I am the sole provider and have a newborn. I want to expand my skills much further and get deeper into general programming as opposed to page-building on a visual canvas.\n\n  \nWould love some advice from the professionals!",

I have never heard noises like that sans a car crash I witnessed. \n\nI parked my car at work and immediately got under my car. I was terrified I cracked my differential. Saw condensation coming off my car and was like shit is that oil. Cause it was dark. So I threw a rag under the car went to work and it was kinda amber grey and I was like UGH. I'd made an appointment during my shift for an \"oil change\" but walked in like a big wa wa baby going I MAY HAVE CRACKED MY OIL PAN I SWEAR IM NOT DUMB \n\nGuys laughed at me so hard xD super nice everything was fine but they told me I absolutely scraped the underside of my car. \n\nI filed a complaint with the city knowing full well taking tracks out of commission is definitely not happening. So I blubbered to my gpt. \n\nBare in mind I have EVOC training. (Emergency vehicle obstacle course) and drove 5 years in Los Angeles and Orange County. I have never been SO EMBARASSED of my driving.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nFollowing up on my last project where I built a standard RAG system, I learned a ton from the community feedback.\n\nWhile the local-only approach was great for privacy, many of you pointed out that for **GraphRAG** specifically—which requires heavy processing to extract entities and build communities—local models can be slow on larger datasets.\n\nSo, I decided to level up. I implemented **Microsoft's GraphRAG** with a flexible backend. You can run it **100% locally** using Ollama (for privacy/free testing) **OR** switch to the **Google Gemini API** with a single config change if you need production-level indexing speed.\n\nThe result is a chatbot that doesn't just retrieve text snippets but understands the *structure* of the data. I even added a visualization UI to actually *see* the nodes and edges the AI is using to build its answers.\n\nI documented the entire build process in a detailed tutorial, covering the theory, the code, and the deployment.\n\n**The full stack includes:**\n\n* **Engine:** Microsoft GraphRAG (official library).\n* **Dual Model Support:**\n   * *Local Mode:* Google's Gemma 3 via **Ollama**.\n   * *Cloud Mode:* **Gemini API** (added based on feedback for faster indexing).\n* **Graph Store:** LanceDB + Parquet Files.\n* **Database:** PostgreSQL (for chat history).\n* **Visualization:** React Flow (to render the knowledge graph interactively).\n* **Orchestration:** Fully containerized with Docker Compose.\n\n**In the video, I walk through:**\n\n* **The Problem:**\n   * Why \"Classic\" RAG fails at reasoning across complex datasets.\n   * What path leads to Graph RAG → throuh Hybrid RAG\n* **The Concept:** A visual explanation of Entities, Relationships, and Communities & What data types match specific systems.\n* **The Workflow:** How the system indexes data into a graph and performs \"Local Search\" queries.\n* **The Code:** A deep dive into the Python backend, including how I handled the switch between local and cloud providers.\n\n**You can watch the full tutorial here:**\n\n[https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc](https://youtu.be/0kVT1B1yrMc)\n\n**And the open-source code (with the full Docker setup) is on GitHub:**\n\n[https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG](https://github.com/dev-it-with-me/MythologyGraphRAG)\n\nI hope this hybrid approach helps anyone trying to move beyond basic vector search. I'm really curious to hear if you prefer the privacy of the local setup or the raw speed of the Gemini implementation—let me know your thoughts!",

Things like \"always use TypeScript strict mode\" and \"prefer functional components\" - pretty standard stuff.\n\nBut Cursor straight up ignores them. Like they don't exist.\n\nHere's where it gets frustrating:\n\n* If I put the same rules in `.cursorrules` at my project root → **works perfectly**\n* If I put them in User Rules (Settings) → **nothing happens**\n\n**The Corporate Catch-22:**\n\nMy company has a policy: no `.cursorrules` file in repos (CTO maintains that), and we can't gitignore it either. So I'm stuck needing *global* rules that apply to everything I code, but the feature that's supposed to do exactly that... doesn't.\n\n**What I've Tried:**\n\n* Restarting Cursor (multiple times)\n* Different models (Claude 3.5, GPT-4)\n* Clearing settings and re-adding rules\n* Checked the official docs (they're... sparse on this)\n\n**Questions for the community:**\n\n1. Does anyone else's User Rules actually work? What am I missing?\n2. Is there a workaround for getting global rules without `.cursorrules`?\n3. Has anyone found success with the new `.cursor/rules/` folder approach for personal rules?\n\n  \nI've seen some people use tools like [cursor.directory](https://cursor.directory) or [promptdir.info](https://promptdir.info) to manage and organize their rules - curious if anyone's had better luck with external rule management that can be applied globally.\n\nAny help would be huge. This feels like such a basic feature that should \"just work.\"",

                  "text": "(its a flask n postgres project)# YourProject — Agent Instructions (Production)\n\nThese instructions apply to the entire repository rooted at `/path/to/your/project`.\n\n## Non‑negotiables\n\n1. Every modification must be documented in `changes.md` (see \"Change documentation\").\n2. Preserve production safety: do not bypass CSRF, rate limiting, session validation, or security middleware.\n3. Do not break gevent startup ordering: `startup.py` must monkey‑patch before any SSL/network imports.\n4. Prefer small, surgical edits; avoid large rewrites of `app.py` unless explicitly requested.\n\n## Project reality (keep changes aligned)\n\n- **Production context**\n  - High-traffic deployment behind Cloudflare + Traefik (`your-site.example.com`).\n  - Real client IP comes from Cloudflare (`CF-Connecting-IP`) and must not be spoofable.\n- **Entry points**\n  - `app.py` defines the global Flask application (`app = Flask(__name__)`).\n  - `startup.py` exists to enforce gevent monkey‑patching order for production.\n- **Deployment**\n  - Docker Compose service: `your-service` (with `your-service_postgres`, `your-service_redis`) in `docker-compose.yml`.\n  - Gunicorn gevent workers (default `GUNICORN_WORKERS=6`); DB pool sizing depends on worker count.\n- **Auth**\n  - Session-based authentication (not JWT). Check `session.get('user_id')` / `session.get('is_admin')`.\n- **Configuration**\n  - Centralized config lives in `config_manager.py` (`config_manager` singleton). Prefer reading config from there (or passing config into helpers) instead of sprinkling new `os.getenv(...)` calls.\n- **Data storage**\n  - JSON files under `DATA_DIR` (Docker mounts `./data` → `/data`); use `routes/data_paths.py`.\n  - PostgreSQL integration is enabled when `USE_DATABASE=true` via `database_integration.py` (psycopg2 pool + tenacity).\n- **Redis**\n  - Redis is used for caching/sessions/rate limiting; always use `redis_manager.py` APIs (built-in fallback exists).\n\n## Coding style\n\n- Prefer functions + small modules; add type hints for touched function signatures where reasonable (use `python3`, not `python`).\n- Use guard clauses (early returns) for invalid states; keep the happy path last; avoid deep nesting.\n- Avoid circular imports: do not import from `app.py` inside blueprints/utilities unless unavoidable—extract shared helpers instead.\n- Prefer a simple RORO shape for helpers: accept a single dict-like \"params/context\" object, return a dict result.\n\n## Routes and request lifecycle\n\n- Prefer placing new routes in `routes/` as Blueprints and registering them in `app.py` near the existing blueprint section.\n- Use existing decorators/hooks consistently:\n  - Security: `security_middleware.security_check` (and app-level `before_request` protections)\n  - Rate limiting: `rate_limiting.rate_limit` / other limiter helpers\n  - CSRF: `csrf_protection.csrf_required` for all state-changing endpoints\n- Return shapes:\n  - HTML routes: redirect with user-friendly messages.\n  - API routes: JSON errors with appropriate status codes.\n\n## Security standards (production)\n\n- State-changing routes (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE): require `@csrf_required` and an appropriate rate-limit decorator.\n- Apply request validation consistently: prefer `security_middleware.security_check` on blueprint routes and keep app-level `before_request` protections intact.\n- Treat all headers/paths as untrusted:\n  - Keep Cloudflare-aware IP detection order; do not trust `X-Forwarded-For` without proxy validation.\n  - Validate all filesystem paths and user-provided filenames.\n- Validate/sanitize user input with existing validators (`input_validation.py`) and log security-relevant failures with request context.\n- For subprocess/system calls, prefer `secure_subprocess.py`; avoid ad-hoc `subprocess.*` with untrusted input.\n- Do not weaken CSP/HSTS/security headers (Traefik labels + Flask `after_request`) without an explicit, documented reason and verification plan.\n\n## Performance standards (high-traffic)\n\n- Avoid per-request disk work: use `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)` for reads and `atomic_update_json(...)` for writes.\n- Keep lock windows small: do expensive validation/processing before entering `atomic_update_json` update functions.\n- Prefer caching over recomputation: use Redis-backed caches where available; code must still work when Redis is down (fallback mode).\n- Don't block request workers with long I/O (file/network): use `async_operations.py` patterns for background/async work.\n- Keep DB usage pool-friendly: short transactions, fetch only needed fields, return connections promptly, and avoid N+1 patterns.\n\n## JSON config/data edits (important)\n\n- Treat JSON files as shared concurrent state (multiple workers/requests).\n- For reads: prefer `data_cache.load_json_cached(...)`.\n- For writes: prefer `data_cache.atomic_update_json(path, update_fn)`; do not hand-roll read/modify/write.\n- When adding new JSON files, put them under `data/` (or `DATA_DIR`) and keep schemas backward-compatible.\n\n## File uploads and filesystem\n\n- For uploads and file writes, prefer hardened helpers:\n  - Path/file validation: `secure_file_ops.SecureFileOperations`\n  - Atomic JSON: `atomic_json.AtomicJSONManager`\n  - File locking: `file_locking.FileLockManager`\n- Always use `werkzeug.utils.secure_filename` for user-provided filenames and validate content (extension + magic) before processing.\n\n## Database integration (PostgreSQL)\n\n- Use `database_integration.py` as the primary API surface when `USE_DATABASE=true`.\n- Always acquire connections via context management:\n  - `DatabaseConnectionContext` or decorators in `database_decorator.py` (e.g., `@with_database_context`).\n- Never hold a DB connection across requests; always return to the pool.\n- Use `RealDictCursor` when you need dict-like row access.\n\n## Redis\n\n- Use `redis_manager.redis_manager` (singleton) or `app.redis_manager` when available.\n- Prefer `redis_manager.get(...)` / `redis_manager.set(...)` and `@redis_operation` to get automatic fallback behavior.\n- Don't assume Redis is up: code must behave correctly when `redis_manager.is_connected` is `False`.\n\n## Logging, monitoring, and errors\n\n- Prefer production/structured logging helpers (`production_logging.py`, `structured_logging.py`).\n- Avoid logging secrets (session cookies, passwords, tokens, raw auth headers).\n- Use existing error patterns (`error_handling.py`, `error_handler.py`, `specific_error_handlers.py`) for consistency.\n\n## Running / maintenance\n\n- Deploy/rebuild service: `make build` (runs Docker Compose for `your-service` as configured).\n- Quick syntax check: `python3 -m compileall .`\n\n## Change documentation (required)\n\nAll modifications must be documented in `changes.md` immediately after implementation. Each entry must include:\n\n- Timestamp\n- Files touched\n- Exact code added/removed/changed (include file paths and line numbers where applicable)\n- What the change does + why it was made",

You easily see just how often your rules are ignored.\n\n\nTo make matters worse, I also use Claude Code in Cursor, which has its own method of adding rules. The setup I found to be the best is to add a cursor rule in your user settings saying ALWAYS read and follow all instructions in my AGENTS.md and global CLAUDE.md files. Then at the top of AGENTS.md reference your CLAUDE.md with a similar rule. Do the same in your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nAlso make sure you update your cursor settings to \"always\" (aka, sometimes, when it feels like it) use your CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nThis way Cursor and Claude Code will, in my experience, always find and use your rules. I keep project specific rules and general information in AGENTS.md and my global rules in CLAUDE.md.\n\n\nI have also heard, and I forget the source, that AGENTS.md is loaded in context at a more.... privileged? Level. Somewhere between user query and system prompt. I think this matters because the models will interpret it with a more direct interpretation. Instead of like \"well the user said X, but they probably really mean Y.\"",

It incorporates a bunch of quality-of-life features and mobile friendly layout.\n\nSupports both text-based and video feed content.\n\n**Why?**\n\nFor those who prefer not to use a Google account to stay connected with creators, following via RSS provides a way to do so without being tied to a specific platform.\n\nSince FreshRSS is web-based, you can access your subscriptions and playlists from any device.\n\n**Recent features:**\n\n* Add your own Invidious instance to use it as video playback source.\n* Simulated \"Picture-in-Picture\" mode, allowing scrolling through the feed while keeping the video in the bottom corner of the page.\n\n**Other features:**\n\n* Fullscreen viewing for videos and articles.\n* Familiar video layout to e.g. YouTube.\n* Dark mode.\n* Redesigned mobile menus for better one-handed navigation.\n\n**Note for existing Youlag users:**\n\nYoulag is now installed as a standard FreshRSS extension, and no longer uses the \"User CSS/JS\" method. To upgrade, please install it as with any other FreshRSS extension.\n\nFind more details and instructions, see the repository:\n\n[https://github.com/civilblur/youlag](https://github.com/civilblur/youlag)",

      "text": "I wanted to share a feature idea that I think would be genuinely useful for a lot of people who use ChatGPT regularly.\n\nMany of us use ChatGPT in very different contexts. For example, I use it heavily for work (research, writing, technical problem-solving), but I also use it for personal things like creative writing, casual conversation, or life organization. Right now, everything lives under a single “identity” and memory space. Over time, this can lead to some friction. Personal context, preferences, or conversational tone can bleed into work-related sessions, and vice versa. Even when the model is trying to be helpful, the crossover can feel distracting or slightly off in professional contexts.\n\nA potential solution could be multiple user profiles under one account, each with:\n- Its own dedicated memory\n- Its own tone / preference history\n- Optional manual switching (e.g., “Work,” “Personal,” “Creative,” etc.)\n\nThis wouldn’t require changing how memory works fundamentally, just giving users a way to scope it. From a UX perspective, it could be as simple as a profile selector, similar to browser profiles or IDE workspaces.\n\nCurious if others have run into the same issue, or if OpenAI has thought about something like this already.",

So far, everything works fine — your framework supports all three tables. One day you discover that the framework doesn’t support table D. You improve the framework, and then you discover that table E also doesn’t work. This behavior becomes even more frequent when the data source is outside your domain (for example, a third-party API where you have no control over change management or even proper release notifications). In order not to impact operations, delivery speed becomes very tight, and the framework’s quality starts to degrade more and more.\n\nThen one day a Source Y appears, with a completely different logic… and the team has the idea of aggregating all the logic of the new source into the same framework used for Source X.\n\nI’m specifically talking about data ingestion, where metadata-driven approaches can actually work quite well.\n\nThe problem is when people later have the “brilliant” idea of building a framework for the Gold layer, for example… and before you know it, the team is basically building a new ORM — full of flaws and limitations — far more complex than simply having custom SQL code for each scenario.\n\n  \n\\---------------------\n\nYou mentioned documentation?\n\nHere, people don’t read documentation… and on top of that, it’s almost always incomplete and poorly written.\n\nDocumentation itself has also become a very controversial topic nowadays, often bordering on “overengineering.”",

Yes it might be technically correct to run everything through 100% CICD with completely metadata-driven abstract code but usually it ends up being too complicated and it starts to break down immediately when the first dev uses a shortcut to create something quickly for the customer.\n\nImo Data Vault 2.0 is the pinnacle of over-engineering when it comes to data modeling. It has some good design patterns but if you do it by the book, you are basically preparing all kinds of scenarios that come up so rarely that it is not worth it.\n\nI've been on this field for 20 years and I've seen lots of shit like basically Power BI being recreated as some kind of metadata-driven monstrosity.",

There is no internal continuity across separate inferences. \n\n- Did they test asking the same questions in scenarios where the model succeeded, or where it was genuine error?\n\n\nWithout those two things, the results mentioned in the video can mean nothing more than \"if you ask for a confession the model will hallucinate a confession narrative\". And the first part I'm not even sure is possible to resolve. If the decision to be deceptive was logged in CoT output and kept in context for the AI to 'remember', then the idea of 'confession' mode is meaningless because you already can see the output of it making that decision. And yeah, my first point... if you didn't log the thought process like that, the AI can't remember making any decision, so what exactly is it confessing",

When there's no CoT on, every reason the model gives you afterwards is a guess on what they see themselves doing in past outputs.\n\nSince they have already said something, the situation becomes a paradox where the tokens used to justify the tokens that were already output are influenced by the tokens that were already output.\n\n\\*Without a CoT they can access *across turns*, whenever we ask \"**why did you do that?**\", what we're actually asking is \"**why *****do you think***** you did that?**\"\n\nThe *across turns* is important because presently, at least for the models we have access to, the CoT that corresponds to be present turn is something they can only access within that turn. They can't see CoT of previous turns so they are pretty much just as lost as a model that doesn't have CoT at all when giving out their rationale for any past turns outputs.\n\nI am not sure if there is research evaluating the degree of variation in the  explanations when you look at CoT within the same turn vs when you ask for rationale post-turn.\n\nSounds like a very interesting thing to look into.",

I sculpted things for everyone for xmas and I told it what I wanted to sculpt and asked it to generate an image to use as a reference. It helped me both design the piece and test out different color options for painting them. \n\nI've asked it for recipes but it comes up with some weird stuff, so usually if it comes up with something I like the sounds of, I'll ask it to find a link to a similar recipe online and I'll use that. Because GPT's measurements might be off and such.\n\nI know it's kind of discouraged to trust for medical advice, but it helped me diagnose that I was probably having a gallbladder attack, and told me to go to the doctor if it lasted too long. It helped me to know what caused it (the big fatty meal I'd had just before) and to not trigger another one, what to eat for the next 48-72 hours etc. It did tell me that I need to tell my doctor about it, I may need it removed.",

Such as asking for ideas of something to do, with teenagers that aren't into sports or outdoor activities, keep the price point under this amount and the location in this general area. And then I can refine the criteria and not have to do a whole new search. Using the + and - in Google search is too arduous and doesn't produce good results. \nRequesting general medical information is also useful for this. I asked about COVID and subclade K flu and could add aspects to the request, plus have it cite sources to verify the information provided. And it can then present a table if that is useful (such as comparing symptoms). For some reason I can rarely find the viruses that are prevalent in my area and yet the chatbots have an easier time of this.\nI also have it break down complex medical concepts. \nI don't ask for being diagnosed at all, I just prefer the data. Then again I've been an AI trainer for 2.5 years so I use the models mostly for information and not necessarily inspiration or companionship. And I do ask for sources to be cited. ",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’ve noticed that while `CLAUDE.md` is powerful, writing a truly effective one takes a lot of time. Most people just copy-paste generic templates that don't actually match their specific environment or tech stack.\n\nSo, I built an open-source skill called `agents-md-generator` that automates this properly. It’s not just a template dumper; it acts like a Setup Wizard for your AI Agent.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Smart Environment Detection:** It checks if you are running **Docker Compose**, **Laravel Sail**, or **Native/Host**. It reads your `package.json`, `composer.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc., to auto-detect your exact stack (Frontend, Backend, Testing framework, Linters).\n2. **Interactive \"Interview\" Mode:** It asks you specific questions about your workflow:\n\n* *What scan depth do you need?* (Quick 30s vs. Deep 5m traversal)\n* *Do you need Git Workflow rules?* (Branch naming, Commit format)\n* *Do you need Security guidelines?* (Env handling, Input validation)\n\n1. **Smart Updates (No Overwriting):** If you already have a file, it offers a **Merge Mode** to preserve your custom rules while adding new structure.\n2. **Cross-Compatibility:** It automatically handles `CLAUDE.md` and symlinks it to `AGENTS.md` so it works across different AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf) simultaneously.\n\n**Why I created this Repository:** I tried existing skill marketplaces but found them overwhelming—over 35,000+ skills, most of which seemed unverified or low quality. It was impossible to know what actually worked. And I wanted a standard way to onboard my AI agents to any new or existing project instantly, without missing context like \"how to run tests\" or \"where the docs are.\"\n\nIt's part of my **Awesome AI Agent Skills** repo. It’s free, open-source, and I’d love for you to try it out (especially the \"Deep Scan\" mode) and tell me what you think.\n\n**Repo:** [https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills](https://github.com/thienanblog/awesome-ai-agent-skills)",

              "text": "**That’s a really valid point! Using Claude to maintain and prune the file is definitely the best way to keep it updated in the long run. I’m not trying to replace the default** `claude init` **or manual maintenance; rather, I built** `agents-md-generator` **to bridge the gap before that maintenance cycle even begins.**\n\n**Here is why this 'Bootstrap' approach matters:**\n\n**1. Solving the \"Cold Start\" & Ground Truth** While `claude init` is great, it often lacks deep context or resorts to guessing if config files are complex. My **skill** programmatically scans `package.json`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc., to verify exact versions and commands. It even includes specific framework references that a generic prompt might miss, ensuring the AI understands the project structure immediately, not just superficially.\n\n**2. The Educational \"Aha!\" Moment** Many developers are new to `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`. They might not yet know how to leverage context effectively or what a \"good\" instruction file looks like. This **skill** provides a robust, standardized skeleton based on my own experience. It helps users look at the generated file and say, *\"Ahh, so that’s how I should be guiding the AI!\"* It turns the file from a simple prompt into a comprehensive project map.\n\n**3. Completeness vs. Context Saving** I’ve experimented a lot with context optimization. However, for beginners or complex legacy projects, \"premature optimization\" of context can lead to hallucinations. I believe it's better to start with a full, accurate context (even if it's longer) to ensure the AI creates high-quality code first. Users can always prune it later as they get comfortable, but this **skill** ensures they start on the right foot.\n\n**In short, think of my skill as the rigorous onboarder that sets the stage for the AI, making your workflow of using Claude to maintain it afterwards much more effective.**",

EchoTTS is by far the best for one-shot cloning when it comes to sounding like the reference audio.  I put Vibe Voice in 3rd place; it really was not good.\n\nAlso, on the paid front, I don't have proof, but I swear ElevenLabs made their quick clones worse on purpose.  I used to use ElevenLabs with API and thought it was decent, but compared to EchoTTS, it is not good.  I have never done the \"Pro\" voice clone on 11 Labs, but their one-shot option has gotten worse on both v2 and v3 models.  I am going the have to go back and take a look at RVC and see if I can get something better that replicates 11 Labs \"Voice Changing\", because it is a nice feature when used with these AI video generators that do audio, but you want to use your own voices.  I think changing the audio on an existing video looks more natural than having AI try to change the video to match the audio.  I don't have the magic button, but I now know Vibe Voice with the 7B model is not the answer.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been iterating on a local RAG pipeline for documentation search, and the biggest bottleneck wasn't the LLM inference speed, it was the retrieval quality. I realized my vector store was full of duplicate chunks, boilerplate legalese, and \"low-entropy\" garbage (like 500 copies of a copyright footer).\n\nI spent the last two weeks testing different tools to clean the data *before* embedding. Here is my honest breakdown of the landscape, from \"Heavyweight\" to \"Lightweight\".\n\n# 1. The Heavyweight: [Unstructured.io](http://Unstructured.io)\n\nThis is the go-to for parsing weird formats.\n\n* **Pros:** Incredible at ripping text out of complex PDFs and tables. If you have messy source files, start here.\n* **Cons:** It is HEAVY. The dependencies are massive, and processing time can be slow.\n* **Verdict:** Essential for ingestion/parsing, but overkill if you just need to clean/deduplicate JSONL or plain text.\n\n# 2. The Default: LangChain (RecursiveSplitter + Regex)\n\nWhat 90% of tutorials use.\n\n* **Pros:** Built-in, zero extra setup.\n* **Cons:** It's \"dumb\" slicing. It doesn't check for semantic duplicates. If you have the same paragraph on page 5 and page 50, both go into your Vector DB, polluting the search results.\n* **Verdict:** Good for prototyping, bad for production quality.\n\n# 3. The Enterprise Scale: HuggingFace text-dedup\n\nUsed for training massive datasets (like The Pile).\n\n* **Pros:** Uses MinHash LSH + Spark. Extremely scalable for terabytes of data.\n* **Cons:** Overkill for a local RAG setup. Setting up a Spark cluster just to clean a 2GB dataset is painful.\n* **Verdict:** Great for pre-training models, too complex for RAG pipelines.\n\n# 4. The \"Middle Ground\": EntropyGuard (My Local Project)\n\nI couldn't find a tool that was **semantic** (like embeddings) but **lightweight** (runs on a laptop), so I built a CLI tool using Polars and FAISS.\n\n* **The Approach:** It uses a hybrid pass. First, `xxhash` removes exact duplicates (fast). Then, it uses a small sentence-transformer model to find semantic duplicates (e.g., \"Error 500\" vs \"Server Error 500\") and removes them based on vector distance.\n* **Pros:**\n   * Runs locally (no API costs).\n   * Uses **Polars LazyFrames**, so it handles datasets larger than RAM (I processed 65k docs on 16GB RAM without OOM).\n   * Filters out \"low entropy\" chunks (repetitive noise).\n* **Cons (Being honest):**\n   * CLI only (no GUI).\n   * Currently optimized for English (multilingual is experimental).\n   * Docs are still a work in progress compared to LangChain.\n\n# My Question for you:\n\nI'm currently betting on **semantic deduplication** (checking meaning) rather than just regex cleaning.\n\n**What is your strategy for \"dirty\" data in RAG?** Do you just throw everything into Pinecone/Chroma and hope the re-ranker sorts it out, or do you have a specific pre-processing pipeline?\n\n*Full disclosure: I am the maintainer of tool #4 (EntropyGuard). I built it because I kept OOMing my laptop with custom Pandas scripts.

My bad for jumping straight into the weeds. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** is basically giving an LLM a 'search engine' or a 'private library' to look at before it answers your question.\n\nInstead of relying only on what it learned during training, the model searches your documents, finds the relevant parts, and uses them as context. The problem I'm describing in the post is that if that 'search' returns a bunch of garbage/noise along with the answer, small local models get confused. That's where the cleaning (and EntropyGuard) comes in.",

At first I thought I was just lazy or burned out, but then I noticed how many tiny decisions I was making all day. When to start. What to work on. Which task is more important. Whether to take a break or not. My brain was exhausted before even doing real work. So I tried removing decisions instead of adding structure. Same work time every day. Same place. Same order of tasks. No asking myself “do I feel like it?”. And somehow my energy came back. I’m not working harder, I’m just wasting less mental effort choosing. Productivity feels lighter when you stop asking your brain to decide everything all the time. Anyone else notice decision fatigue being the real enemy?\n\n",

Posted it on Reddit, got some traction, went to bed.\n\nWoke up to find a user with a balance of $21,474,836.47. That's INT\\_MAX. On Christmas morning.\n\n**What happened:**\n\nMy Supabase RLS policy said \"users can update their own row.\" Sounds safe, right?\n\nExcept \"their own row\" included the `balance` column. So they just... updated it.\n\n    -- What I had (bad)\n    CREATE POLICY \"Users can update own row\" \n    ON users FOR UPDATE \n    USING (auth.uid() = id);\n    \n    -- What I needed (good)  \n    CREATE POLICY \"Users can update own profile\" \n    ON users FOR UPDATE \n    USING (auth.uid() = id)\n    WITH CHECK (\n      -- only allow updating safe columns\n      balance = (SELECT balance FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid())\n    );\n\n**The same user also tried XSS:**\n\nSet their `avatar_url` to `javascript:alert(\"meow\")`. My RLS let them update that too. The avatar rendered as \"MEOW\" instead of a single letter initial - that's how I caught it.\n\n**Their $21M message:**\n\n>\"meowww mrrp :3\"\n\nI'm keeping it. It's art now.\n\n**Lessons:**\n\n1. \"Users can update their own row\" is not a security policy - it's a vulnerability\n2. Allowlist columns explicitly, don't trust row-level alone\n3. Your first real users will try to break everything\n4. Ship anyway, fix fast, learn publicly\n\nThe site is [https://onedollarchat.com](https://onedollarchat.com) if you want to see the chaos.",

I want to make money, not a little, as much as I can. I thought about starting a startup, but I feel like it’s a bit too complicated for the first thing that I build on my own and I thought i need at least a bit of experience in this world. I thought about reselling on Vinted etc, but never really got motivated. Seo/ smma seems like a good first job, I would do everting on my own I’m pretty good in tech and I could even code the websites (if needed) on my own. Idk, I just want to achieve that dream I just have to start, I don’t know where tho. Can someone help me? How did you start? How did you create a profitable business? What would you say it’s the best thing you can do at my age to make as much money as possible as of now? I can code, I’m good in every aspect of informatics/ cyber security, I’m determined and I become easily obsessed with something that I want to achieve. I would love to find people as motivated as me to work together and figure something out. Thanks in advance for your advice",

Their app and automatic import is pretty buggy and always break. Since it is a free service I cannot expect more. Recently they had a major breakage and their solution to it was launch a new app :/\n\nAnyways, I am considering moving to Monarch which is paid service and well integrated (from my research so far). I am fine paying for it but I dislike the idea of all my data on yet another external cloud service.\n\nSo, I am planning to give ActualBudget with SimpleFin a try. Automatic transaction import from various banks is pretty important to me so I wanted to find out how good is the SimpleFin integration for automatic imports and how is the coverage across major banks/CC/retirement accounts? \n\nI did a quick search on ActualBudget subreddit and found some gaps but it is same on Monarch side too. Generally when people have issues then they post so I want to not over index on this amplified signal.\n\nPeople who use ActualBudget with SimpleFin automatic imports can you please share your experience?\n\n\n\n",

Google let us down, but with a good verbose prompt, Copilot identified the issue and walked us through the solution.\n\n2. Recently, I’ve been doing some hiring for new positions. Bain of my existence is writing job reqs especially for new jobs.  Wrote another very verbose prompt and with some minor tweaking got the job reqs and a sample responsive resume sample for the recruiters.\n\n3. We discovered we were sorely lacking in governance for one part of the business. With Copilot, I wrote a Policy, two supporting Standards, and two helpful Guidelines to describe the new governance regime. Ensured it was all tied back to the ISOs and included corporate relevant tie backs as well. We still put it through 3 rounds of redlines with different audiences, but the basic document set we started with took less than an hour to produce.

Very useful.\n\n- A while ago, as a hobby-project, I built a phone-app to do X.  Recently, I told an AI \"find phone apps that do X\".  It found my app, and others, then said \"but you can do same thing without an app, just use Import function of standard phone-app Y\".  I felt like an idiot, should have just done it that way in the first place.\n\n- A minor thing: it's good at writing uBlock Origin rules.  Fixed an issue I had.\n\nAs far as \"daily life\", no.  But suppose AI were integrated into the browser ?  Maybe yes.  Something simple like a browser button to ask \"AI, is this web page a scam or attack ?\".  Might be useful.",

The model should never be able to change filters or decide what it can see.\n\nWhere teams struggle in production is keeping permissions in sync once data is chunked and embedded, and proving who accessed what later.\n\nIf you are early, separate indexes per security domain are fine.

          "text": "The metadata approach usually works better than separate RAGs. Tag documents during ingestion with access levels, then filter at query time based on user permissions.\n\nMost people implement this with a permission layer that sits between the user query and vector search. Check user role, add metadata filters to the vector query, only return chunks they're authorized to see. Works with any vector store that supports metadata filtering.\n\nThe tricky part is getting the access control metadata right during document processing, which is where I spend time with the tooling I work on at vectorflow.dev. If you're dealing with mixed-permission documents like HR files, you might need to chunk by section and tag each chunk individually rather than document-level tagging.\n\nSeparate RAGs per department gets expensive and creates data silos. Single RAG with runtime filtering scales better.",

      "text": "I have about 35 years of pro contract software development experience. I started playing with Copilot for coding assistance some months ago and then switched to ChatGPT maybe a month ago. At first it was very useful but the past couple of weeks it has become more and more unreliable. It keeps forgetting things we've just done and spitting out code that breaks things we aren't working on even though I feed it my entire source file every time I ask it to do something complex because it seemed to be forgetting what was in that file since the last time I uploaded it.\n\nI'm currently working on a Python project and asked for a change in functionality so it spit out a few code blocks and told me to replace the existing functions with the new versions it provided. I did this and ran it again and I got an error message from the new code which I fed back into ChatGPT. It replied \"That message (“Scan produced no device events…”) is **not present** in the [`bt.py`](http://bt.py) you just uploaded...\" \\[emphasis ChatGPT\\] and then \"So you are almost certainly running a **different** [**bt.py**](http://bt.py) **on the Pi** (stale copy under `/opt/...` or a different module path) than the one you edited/uploaded.\"\n\nIn other words, you aren't running the code you think you are, except that exact error message is in one of the functions ChatGPT gave me **2 minutes go in response to my last prompt**. How could it have forgotten what it told me to insert in my code so soon? When I pointed this out by sending back the function it had just given me two minutes earlier its response was \"Correct: that error string is coming from the exact `bt_scan()` you pasted.\"\n\nNo recognition that it's short term memory didn't even go back 120 seconds. It wasn't like this a month ago when I started using it in place of Copilot. This is making ChatGPT almost useless because it's doing this regularly now. What changed?",

Depends on the stage of ideation. If an idea isn't grounded, relatable, explainable. Then no. It can't feel authored by me. It's just an idea that floated past, and I never grappled with.\n\nBut ideas that I understand, can explain, have examples for, are grounded. Definitely... So it depends in what context the mirror goes missing.\n\nIs silence part of thinking, not just a gap between prompts?\n\n100% It's one of the main the assymetries in H-AI conversations with Language Models. They operate in turns, relatively, we operate on a relatively near-infinite time-scale. And can even travel \"back in time\" to continue exploring ideas with a context we haven't touched in months. To the model not a moment has gone by. To us? Who knows how our thinking has changed since our last turn.\n\nNot always being in the flow, and having time to step away, reason deeply, formulate a response not just a stream of thought. That's one benefit of these conversations. Nobody is waiting for you to finish thinking (super helpful to my cognitive style)",

They're the ones struggling with mania.\n\nFor me, it's like being in a classroom and having the teacher's attention all to myself. It's like reading a book, only I can stop and ask it questions and interact with it. Sometimes the book is a trashy novel, sometimes it's an educational piece. Why would I take a break from that? I don't take breaks from the internet, computer games, TV or my exercise bike. It's simply a new piece of technology that has enriched my life and made it infinitely more interesting.\n\nThere is this weird fringe group of people who think that everyone who uses AI more than five minutes has lost touch with reality. They never seem to mention the people who will spend twelve hours a day playing online games, or watching YouTube vids, or posting on Reddit. AI is just the new technology that everyone is losing their shit over. We use it, the novelty wears off, and we move on to the next toy.\n\n\\*sits back and eats more popcorn\\*",

Running llama.cpp with -sm row gives a big uplift in inference performance, but also requires a lot more bandwidth (in my experience, at least X4 for each GPU with weaker cards, or X8 for more powerful cards). The PCIe adapters with a PCIe switch also aren't cheap, negating any savings from running using a Pi.\n\nStill, it's über cool, and definitely something worth looking into if you want something that runs 24/7 and your model (or models) all fit within a single GPU.",

Especially if some work has to precede another (couple of PRs have to get merged before others can be created/started)\n* Ideally I can choose the level of supervision: “ask me before these X major decisions” vs “keep going unless you get stuck (can't solve something for hours)”\n* The agents should be able to run the project locally/CI to validate changes, but I’m not expecting them to do real-world admin stuff like creating whole new AWS accounts or entering billing details. The SaaS I am building has a fairly simple stack and whole product can be easily tested e2e locally.\n\nDoes anything like this exist today, or is everyone still having the same problems that I do?",

Here are some suggestions to help you get started:\n\n### Learning Path\n- **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**: This is a crucial area for any developer. Understanding DSA will not only help you in interviews but also improve your problem-solving skills.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Cracking the Coding Interview\"* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell\n    - *\"Introduction to Algorithms\"* by Thomas H. Cormen et al.\n  - **Practice**: Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode or HackerRank. Aim for a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems.\n\n- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Since you're in the AI field, a solid understanding of ML concepts will be beneficial.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow\"* by Aurélien Géron\n    - *\"Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning\"* by Christopher M. Bishop\n  - **Courses**: Consider online courses from platforms like Coursera or edX that focus on practical applications of ML.\n\n- **System Design**: This is essential for backend development and will help you in interviews for senior roles.\n  - **Books**:\n    - *\"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\"* by Martin Kleppmann\n    - *\"System Design Interview – An Insider's Guide\"* by Alex Xu\n  - **Practice**: Engage in mock interviews focusing on system design.\n\n### Staying Updated\n- **Tech Stacks**: Follow industry news through blogs, podcasts, and newsletters. Websites like Medium, Dev.to, and specific tech blogs can be valuable.\n- **Hands-On Projects**: Continue working on personal projects or contribute to open-source projects. This will help you apply what you learn and stay relevant.\n\n### Time Management\n- **Daily Routine**: Dedicate specific days to focus on DSA, ML, and system design. For example:\n  - Monday, Wednesday, Friday: DSA practice\n  - Tuesday, Thursday: ML concepts and projects\n  - Saturday: System design and review\n- **Use AI Wisely**: While you can use AI tools for coding, try to solve problems manually first to build your skills, then use AI to refine your solutions.\n\n### Additional Resources\n- **Online Platforms**: Websites like Coursera, Udacity, and edX offer courses on DSA, ML, and system design.\n- **Communities**: Join developer communities on platforms like Reddit, Stack Overflow, or Discord to engage with others and seek advice.\n\nBy following this structured approach, you can enhance your coding skills and prepare for future opportunities while managing your current workload effectively.",

That's just the life of a modern developer. If you work for someone else, the engineers before you already made the decisions and you'll need to learn whatever packages are currently in production.

It seems like the model eventually \"gives up\" on looking at the actual files and relies purely on the text context of the chat.\n\nI have two distinct scenarios where this happens:\n\nScenario 1: The Hallucination (Sequential Descriptions) I use a chat to describe a series of images (e.g., for a storyboard or dataset).\n\n* First \\~10 images: It describes them perfectly.\n* The It stops analyzing the actual uploaded file. Instead, it invents/hallucinates a description that fits the *theme* of the previous 10 images but has nothing to do with the specific image I just uploaded.\n* If I take that exact same image to a fresh chat, it describes it correctly.\n\nScenario 2: The \"Blindness\". I use a chat to generate descriptions for clothing items I'm selling.\n\n* Recently, after a few turns, I upload a new photo of a new item.\n* Gemini explicitly claims it cannot see the new image or insists it is still looking at the photos from the start of the chat (e.g., \"I only see the blue jeans\" when I just uploaded a red shirt).\n* Again, works perfectly in a new chat.\n\nIt drives me crazy because I lose the context/style I established in the chat. I can't keep starting a new chat for every single image just to get it to actually \"look\" at the file.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Is there a hard limit on how many images Gemini can process in a single context window before it bugs out?\n2. Is there a way to force a \"refresh\" of the vision capabilities within an active thread?\n3. Is this a known bug with the current version?\n\nAny insights are appreciated.",

If you have a similar enough repeating pattern, the highest probability completion eventually becomes just repeating the pattern. It's how LLMs work. Think of it like few-shot learning overfitting.\n\nChatGPT users rarely run into this BTW, but not because their model is better. It's because ChatGPT edits their chat transcript behind the scenes. The summarisation breaks the patterns. Gemini doesn't try to edit your chat transcript so you get more opportunity to see the quirks of LLMs as they actually are... this being one of them.",

Copy paste blobs, trust it too much, lose context. When it’s embedded where you already work, you stay in control. For me that was the difference when I switched to Warp. It’s not some magic code writer, it’s literally my terminal with better primitives. I still run the commands, see the output, step in when things get weird. The AI just handles the boring glue work or helps reason about what I’m already staring at. If you turned it off tomorrow, I’d be slower, but not helpless. I’d mostly miss the friction reduction. Stuff like saving repeatable workflows, reusing prompts, having the terminal understand context instead of me re-explaining it every time. None of that replaces knowing what you’re doing. It just removes the tax. Same as the internet analogy someone mentioned. You’re not lazier because you don’t memorize man pages anymore.

Youll never get it perfect before launch, trust me. Plus real user feedback is way more valuable than endless internal testing.\n\n  \nThe code signing thing is tricky. It does add trust, but maybe you can launch a beta version without it and clearly state that its unsigned. Gauge the reaction.\n\n  \nPositioning against free alternatives is the real challenge though. You gotta hammer home the offline thing. People do care about privacy, even if they dont always realize it. Maybe highlight the security aspect in your landing page copy?\n\n  \nWith my first app, getting the first users was super hard, what ended up working was finding all the threads of people asking questions related to it on Reddit and dropping a helpful answer, if they needed the app they would end up using it.\n\n  \nIt was a slow process, super time consuming but it worked great. It eventually led my app to rank on gpt search for a few queries thanks to Reddit being used as a source, it now gets daily downloads with 0 marketing.\n\nThe only issue is how time consuming it is, I used F5 Bot and it would take hours to go through all the notifications (most days I wouldnt go through them all).\n\nSo I built an internal tool which is now my main project and led me to neglect my old app, it automatically finds relevant conversations across Reddit, X and LinkedIn, its what brought me here.\n\nIt lets you engage with your target audience directly, and in Reddit, it gives you good potential to gain passionate users as Reddit users tend to be deep into their niche.\n\n  \nI wish I had it when I was launching my app, could have saved me so much time.\n\n  \nIf you think it can help you scale, Ill be happy to share it",

Most alternatives were React-based. I wanted something modern and simple, preferably with no React dependency.\n\nSo I built [ReallySimpleDocs](https://reallysimpledocs.com/) with 11ty and Basecoat:\n\n* Demo/Docs: [https://reallysimpledocs.com/](https://reallysimpledocs.com/)\n* GitHub: [https://github.com/hunvreus/reallysimpledocs](https://github.com/hunvreus/reallysimpledocs)\n\nYou can either [use the GitHub template](https://github.com/hunvreus/reallysimpledocs/generate) or simply run:\n\n`npm create reallysimpledocs@latest my-docs`\n\nKey features:\n\n* Fast (11ty is one of the fastest site generators).\n* Vanilla CSS, JS and HTML.\n* Git-based. If you need a CMS you can use Pages CMS.\n* Auto-generated llms.txt, llms-full.txt, and per-page /\\*.md exports for LLMs.\n* 100% free and open source.\n\nMore stuff on the [roadmap](https://github.com/hunvreus/reallysimpledocs/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), starting with full-text search",

      "text": "It's probably been said many times, but this \"undersell\" was disguised.\n\nSo I formed a new LLC with my cousin, and we pivoted it several times as our understanding of the market evolved.\n\nEventually, we decided to offer websites because business owners are too busy to build one themselves, even with the ease of doing so.\n\nWe encountered one client who had a website she created herself, but wanted to switch to us because she wanted to sell her products/services online and didn't know how to handle payment integrations, etc.\n\nI told her the cost of doing so would be $1200.\n\nShe responded with:\n\n>**\"But I currently pay $70/year,\"** \n\nThat should have been the first red flag.\n\nThe second red flag was when she freaked out upon hearing that online credit card transactions had processing fees. (Really!? In hindsight, there's no way a business person actually thought that.)\n\nTo me, the value of this early client wasn't the money; I wanted a video testimonial from her to build my newly formed company's reputation.\n\nSo I agreed to do it for $70, and she said she would increase her prices to cover the processing fees.\n\nBig mistake! Obviously. She turned out to be an \"expensive customer\". She kept requesting more and more features, such as a custom online booking system that handles bookings for multiple employees, various custom reports, autoresponders, etc. Then she wanted to sell Spa services, e-commerce products, courses, travel tickets, hotel accommodations, boat cruises, etc., **on the same website** because she didn't want to pay for another website(s). \n\nBtw, she didn't pay to have these add-ons.\n\nWhat a nightmare. Eventually, I cut my losses and told her that I'd refund her if she'd agree to leave me alone.\n\nI wanted to \"do things that don't scale\" and have one-on-ones with my first customers, but I later realized she wasn't my ideal customer.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Recently I've made the swtich from Cursor to Zed because cursor performance has been terrible since 2.0, and I'm loving Zed but couldn't completely switch yet cause I'm feeling Claude on Zed is not as good as it is on Cursor, yeah I know that sounds unlikely right?\n\nI'm using the same model (sonnet most of the time) same rules (cursor settings and .claude/rules), Pro+ plan on Cursor and Pro on Claude (I highly doubt this make any difference anyways) and using it for web development (React + RoR) always planning first and guiding the agent step by step if necessary. And still there's times I feel that Claude on Zed is so much \"dumb\" than when used on Cursor, while on my Claude average use on Cursor I need 2 to 3 prompts to complete a task/step then on Zed I need a lot more cause most of the time the agent is not following all my rules or ignoring project patterns, typescript types and leaving the same lint errors that I asked it to fix few prompts ago.\n\nSo I've made some tests to confirm that, I was starting a new project on Elysia (first time using it) so I created a new project using Elysia cli, made a clone of it and asked the same prompts on both editors using Claude sonnet 4.5:\n\n\\- First I started asking for both agents what are the rules they are receiving in my prompts, there wasn't any project/workspace rule, just the user rules on Cursor and claude global rules on ./claude/rules, [this are the rules I use globally for all AI agents btw](https://gist.github.com/guustavocl/9776865c5964933600701149512b7cbb). So the results were the following:\n\nClaude on Cursor answered with those exactly same rules that I defined on its settings, while Claude on Zed also returned the global rules I defined but not before a huge set of additional rules/explanations/conduct, tbh a load of garbage stuff that's just stalling instead of helping, so maybe that's the cause of the inconsistency between them. (also just remembered that you can also place the rules inside Zed editor, but that doesn't seems to work, if you place it there and ask the agent to list the rules he will never list the ones you placed there)\n\n\\- Next I started asking both agents to setup Eslint and Prettier in the project, neither opted to run the init cli command instead they created the config files manually, they didn't used the .cjs extension for eslint but .json, that's fine it worked as intended at the end.\n\n\\- Next I explained our goals: \"This is a new Elysia API project, we gonna use MongoDB and Mongoose with BetterAuth for authentication, also we gonna need to add openapi and validate our routes using TypeBox, we also need to protect our posts POST/UPDATE/DELETE routes with normal user authorization, and our users GET/UPDATE/DELETE with admin authorization, users don't need a POST route cause we're using sign\\_up from betterauth for that.\".\n\nthen both agents proceeded with planning/explaining to me what they're gonna do first and waiting for approval to start coding, as stated on my rules, both plans were pretty similar so I give them the approval...\n\nNeither nailed it on the first or second try ofc, I've choose MongoDB on purpose cause there's plenty of examples out there using PG/Drizzle with better auth while MongoDB it's listed as experimental, so that's okay and manageable, they've missed some adapters configs and weird stuffs as using id: string instead of mongo \\_id: objectId (default and implicit), but manageable and fixed in a few prompts, similar problems on both agents but some distinct ways of solving it.\n\n\\- After that the API was running, openapi was listing our routes but betterauth routes aren't there, so I instruct them about that and then the nightmare started, while Claude on Cursor manage to fix this in two prompts, Claude on Zed never did, I also give it hints and list the Elysia betterauth docs where there's exactly listed the two piece of codes you need to make it work, but Claude on Zed always wanted to tweak them and either add more code or remove parts of it, in the end I practically told it: \"this piece of code goes here, and this other one goes here, just that.\" to make it works and move on to the next step.\n\n\\- Now both projects were working and showing the betterauth routes on openapi page, but still not capable of sign\\_up and sing\\_in because the mongoose.client that goes into the mongodbAdapter inside betterauth was being instantiated before the mongoose successfully connect to the db, so we needed some kind of singleton around our betterauth instance to handle that, BUT I never explained that to them, it was gonna be too easy right? So I just sent them the console errors about moongose not able to listen the db... Claude on Cursor checked the files and solve it in one prompt, two cause it forget to use the singleton in the authorization middleware. BUT Claude on Zed again never manage to solve that, after dozens of prompts I explained exactly what it needed to do and even after that it poorly implemented something that Claude on Cursor did in the first try, so at this moment I gave up.\n\nTL/DR: I've Tested both agents Claude Sonnet 4.5 on both editors Zed and Cursor with the same tasks, and the inconsistency between them was tremendous, Claude on Cursor nailed it almost every prompt, while Claude on Zed failed to perform the same \"difficult\" tasks.\n\nPS.: Also I was always checking the Zed Claude usage limits on Claude settings page, it has never reached 100% nor dropped to cheap models.\n\nHas anyone gone through something similar and notice these differences? Or am I missing something?\n\nI really want to stuck only with Zed but after all that I'm afraid that I'll spent more time/tokens babysitting Claude than using it on Cursor.\n\nThank you if your read till here, I really appreciate it.",

Add your database connections in the GUI (MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB, Redis, etc. - 11 total)\n2. Enable MCP server\n3. Point your AI agent to it\n4. Done. Works across all your projects.\n\n  **Key features:**\n\n*  Read-only mode per connection (AI can SELECT but can't DROP your prod tables)\n*  Query history - see exactly what queries were executed\n*  SSH tunnel support\n*  macOS, Windows, Linux\n\nLooking for feedback - is this something you'd actually use?

If you are receiving full snapshots you do conditional inserts on hashdiff by key so that you don't write the same data twice. That combined with compressible formats means you only keep actual changed data, which means it isn't sized much larger than SCD2.\n\n> Also, using always the timestamps doesn't force you to run an analytical function over the partition sorted by date to obtain the latest record ?\n\nIf you used only the raw vault to query then it would, yes. But part of the BV batch is running logic like those window functions to find the latest version(s) by key to create derived tables.\n\nOn each batch you can take your fresh raw vault data and determine how it would splice into your current SCD2 history, and update that table. The SCD2 table could materialise all the data, or it could be just the keys pointing back to a specific row in the raw vault. Just the keys can work if you need to save space, as doing an inner join still allows predicate pushdown into the raw vault data unlike with filters on window function ordering.",

Then you need machinery to feed all these tables unnecessarily, and pay for all that compute work. It is just not a framework that is optimized for the cloud native tech. It is pointless in that sense. Also, lots of data engineers you hire will ask to leave the project after 6 months for the amount of endless work that the framework demands. All that under the escuse of it being very robust and adaptable to business logic. Well lots argue that is rather preferable having work maintaining simple models that need to be adapted a bit here and there once in a while than having work on a weekly basis for creating tables all in the same way. It is robotic work that nobody likes to do. Data Vaults advantages can be achieved with much easier to maintain frameworks.",

So I do not have experience in all these usages that you refer to. My question is, what is the actual usable output from all of these. For example, we load data from various to Snowflake using COPY INTO, use  SQL to create a Star schema model. The \"usable Output\" we get in this scenario are various analytics dashboards and reports created using Qlikview etc.\n\n\\[Question 1\\] Similarly, what is the output of a ML pipeline in data bricks ?\n\nI read all these posts about Data Engineering that talk about Snowflake vs Databricks, PySpark vs SQL, loading data to Parquet files, BI vs ML workloads - I want to understand what is the usable output from all these activities that you do ?\n\nWhat is a Machine Learning output? Is it something like a Predictive Information, a Classification etc. ?\n\nI saw a thread about loading images. What type of outputs do you get out of this? Are these uses for Ops applications or for Reporting purposes?\n\nFor example, could an ML output from a Databricks Spark application be the suggestion of what movie to watch next on netflix ? Or perhaps to build an LLM such as ChatGPT ? And if so, are all these done by a Data Engineer or an  ML Engineer?\n\n\\[Question 2\\] Are all these outputs achieved using unstructured data in its unstructured form - or do you eventually need to model it into a schema to be able to get necessary outputs? How do you account of duplications, and non-uniqueness and relational connections between data entities if used in unstructured formats?\n\njust curious to understand the modern usage, by a traditional warehouse Data Engineer?",

I thought this would allow me to keep the main DB disconnected at all times and instead, attach the working as a reading and auditing platform. Then, any data that needed to re-integrate with main, I'd run a promote script between the two. This all sounded good in theory until I realized that I can't attach either while there's a lock on it.\n\nI'd love any suggestions for DuckDB integrations that may solve this problem, features I'm not privy to, or alternatives to DuckDB that I can easily migrate my database over to.\n\nThanks in advance!",

But... this gets impractical sometimes. Again this only works for one instance though, it's not practical for multiple instances. So beyond that it may be worth exploring other options as others have mentioned. But just my thoughts though.",

My GPU is an RTX 2060 12GB (you can see where this is going). Typically, I run PONY and SDXL @ 896x1152 and it will crank one out in 1.25 min. I wanted to try FLUX, so I installed Forge, loaded a checkpoint, prompt and hit Generate. My RTX 2060 laughed and gave me the middle finger. I know I need a much better card, but I am retired and on a fixed income, so I'm going to have to go refurb. Also, knowing me, i will probably want to play with making videos down the road, so I am hoping that I can afford a GPU that will handle it as well.  I would like to stay between $500-600 if possible, but might go a little more if justified. I've had good luck with ASUS and NVidia, and would prefer those brands. Can someone with experience make recommendations as to what is the best value? Also, I have been told that I might need to get a bigger PS too? Your insight and wisdom is appreciated.",

You get faster generations for sure but you’re still limited by the same 16 GB of VRAM. The next step up is a 5090.\n\nDo not buy used 3090s. And stay away from AMD cards for image generation.",

      "text": "I’ve been experimenting with using ChatGPT for long-form generation (chapters, not short posts), and the hardest part hasn’t been tone or clarity — it’s **length control**.\n\nEven with explicit instructions like “write ~2,500 words,” most models seem to hit a practical ceiling around **800–1,100 words per generation**. Past that point, they tend to:\n- compress ideas\n- start summarizing early\n- or behave like they’re “wrapping up,” even when told not to\n\nThings that helped *a bit*:\n- Doing a planning pass first (outline + intent)\n- Generating one chapter at a time\n- Setting **per-chapter word ranges**, not a book-level target\n- Explicitly saying “do not conclude the book”\n\nWhat still didn’t fully solve it:\n- Word counts vary wildly across models\n- “Target 2,500 words” rarely means 2,500 words (API, 4o is very good at controlling word count, 4.1? +- 30%)\n- Pushing longer outputs increases drift and repetition\n\nWhat I ended up doing instead was **designing around the limit**:\n- Treat ~1,000 words as a hard ceiling per generation\n- Split a chapter into internal segments\n- Generate each segment separately\n- Merge them afterward with a pass focused only on transitions and consistency\n\nThis works, but it introduces new tradeoffs (cleanup cost, voice smoothing, repetition), so it feels more like orchestration than pure prompting.\n\nCurious how others here handle this:\n- Do you accept shorter chunks and merge?\n- Have you found prompt patterns that reliably push past ~1k without collapse?\n- Or do you treat long-form as a pipeline problem rather than a prompt problem?\n\nGenuinely interested in how others are approaching this.",

      "text": "After a year of building agentic systems, I’ve come to a pretty strong belief: most “context engineering” problems boil down to two things: **compression and isolation**. And handoffs are where isolation actually becomes real.\n\nIn agent-to-agent workflows, coordination shouldn’t rely on shared memory or implicit context. Each agent should receive an **explicit handoff payload**: a compressed, well-defined snapshot of state.\n\nExample:\n\nA planning agent explores multiple paths and alternatives. It then hands off only the **selected plan**, constraints, assumptions, and success criteria. All speculative reasoning and abandoned branches are intentionally excluded.\n\nThat handoff creates a hard boundary. The next agent executes against a clear contract, not a polluted history.\n\nThe same principle applies to agent-to-human handoffs.\n\nEscalation shouldn’t mean dumping transcripts or logs. A safe handoff should surface:\n\n* What decisions were made\n* What remains uncertain\n* What action is needed next\n\nThis is the difference between **context sharing** and **context transfer**.\n\nIn my experience, agent systems scale when handoffs are:\n\n* explicit, not implicit\n* compressed, not verbose\n* isolated, not shared\n\nMost failures I’ve seen in multi-agent systems aren’t intelligence failures. They’re handoff failures.\n\nCurious where others disagree: Where *does* shared context still outperform explicit handoffs? Or what edge cases break this model?",

Before, I would do long calls, take notes, maybe sketch flows in Figma, then disappear for a week to “build the thing.” Now I show up to the second conversation with something running, even if it’s ugly, and let people click it while they talk. The feedback is way more concrete because they react to real friction instead of hypotheticals. One thing that helped a lot is having my tooling make iteration basically frictionless. I do most of this inside Warp, so spinning up a new prototype, tweaking copy, or wiring a quick backend change while a call is still fresh feels lightweight instead of ceremonial. Being able to save workflows and prompts, reuse environments, and have the terminal help me reason about changes without context switching makes it easier to treat prototypes as disposable learning artifacts instead of precious code. The big mindset shift is that validation now happens in hours or days, not weeks. I don’t try to be right up front. I try to be fast and wrong in front of customers, then adjust. Vibe coding didn’t replace talking to users, but it made those conversations sharper because I’m always reacting to something tangible rather than pitching an idea in abstract.",

I’m debating using it on weekend mornings too, but I worry that will make weekends feel overly controlled instead of restorative.\n\nIf you’ve dealt with this, what actually helped?\n\nDo you put any light structure on weekend mornings, or keep them fully open?\n\nIf you use app blockers on weekends, how do you do it without feeling restricted?\n\n* What’s a simple way to “start” a weekend day so it doesn’t immediately turn into phone time?",

Here is how i am thinking about the GTM, but it seems so thin that i am wondering if i am getting the concept right and wether i have to think more and deeper about it.\n\nThe initial strategy is not to sell to enterprise directly, but rather sell to the professionals themselves with the idea that they like the tool and then request their company to get a subscription for the entire office (i think that was Notion or Figma strategy). The reason is that the product brings value for a single user and doesn't need networks (team features are extra). Also the pricing won't be too high not to try it. \n\nI will start selling at industry live events. I think that will be an opportunity to both sell and get much more instantenious feedback. I also plan on trying to pay for some visibility at events (sponsorship with ability to present etc.)\n\nAnother channel would be through Linkedin Sales Navigator. I experimented a bit and it does identify good leads. \n\nNext would be cold e-mails. In this profession it is common to have public e-mails so i will use that. \n\nI will try industry specific influencers, although this is quite a dry area. \n\nLast, search ads would be the best because the tool is providing intelligence and i want them to get a sample of the tool when they are searching for the information i will provide. \n\nSo is this enough for my first pitch on GTM or am i missing something?",

Only people imagine into existence how decisions are made without doing research, or they ask leading questions in customer interviews, getting false positives.\n\nMore than likely, there is a decision maker and the organization has a software acquisition policy. Put in place explicitly to prevent the kind of chaos you suggest. You might even find -- while not a direct user -- this decision maker (or decision makers) need to use the software in *a completely different way* than your vivid imagination wished into existence.\n\nPerhaps end users output needs to be summarized in some way for management purposes, overview.\n\nYour go to market strategy lacks any basis in reality. Apparently a small concern to the scheming of the wantrepreneurs daydreaming about how things will turn out. That's why they always turn away from the customer discovery they should have done, and ask the question here. Oblivious to a secondary user who *makes the decision*. A group of people who believe you 'fire the boss' wouldn't conclude that guy did anything useful.\n\nYou don't care. You wanted blind encouragement. Okay. U go grrl.\n\nThe point is never crap out something market blind. Launch is not a great time to begin to consider who the end user is, and whether they are the same as the decision maker. Just one of the mistakes when you treat words such as audience, user, customer, visitor, decision maker as synonyms. There is at least one reason the nice words are spelled so differently. Who Knew?\n\nAccurate customer discovery must be the foundation of Go To Market strategy. Else you are daydreaming, mostly about the marketing you find distasteful. The root word of marketing has, is, will forever be *market.* That means marketing can never be last.

My background is in finance, and I am a \"citizen\" developer enjoying coding and doing projects.\n\nI recently shared a short demo with other people and got way more response than expected, aka *“I want to test this”, “Will this be available to buy?”, \"This should be open source / put it on GitHub”, “Insane / mental / sounds great”*\n\nAnd now I’m stuck.\n\nOn one hand, I get the open-source argument: people could contribute, ideas evolve faster, community goodwill, and transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, here’s my reality: I’m not technically strong enough to own and maintain an open-source project properly. I can compile it and bring it to a decent beta/MVP stage, and that's that. + I don’t have time to manage PRs, issues, forks, or governance. If it’s open, someone more skilled could very realistically package it better than I do and run with it. I’m fine paying a developer later if this goes somewhere, but I need to validate it first\n\nMy current instinct says \"keep it closed for now\", grind alone and get a decent version out, find some serious beta testers and collect feedback, reiterate, then decide whether to open parts of it later with a lead dev steering this, as early traction will be here.\n\nSome people say ideas don’t matter, execution does, which is true, but execution also takes time, money, and focus. And I’m one person.\n\nSo I’m genuinely asking:\n\n* What would be the best approach here?\n* If you are a dev, did you regret open-sourcing too early? Did keeping things closed slow you down or protect you?\n* Is “closed first, open later” actually viable, or just copium?\n* Why would one even want to contribute to something like this without any commercial PoC equity/ownership from day one?\n\nI’m trying to make the least stupid decision and would appreciate honest takes, even uncomfortable ones.\n\nThank you",

Competitors will use black hat SEO tactics and pay for fake reviews to get an edge on the market. You should avoid these tactics, I'm just illustrating what you might be up against. I can also tell you speed of response is a big factor in success. Many moving companies have a system where website quote requests trigger an instant outbound auto-dialer to connect the sales team with the prospect before other have time to respond.\n\nI suggest you personalize your website and other messaging to appear as an honest moving company that puts customers first. If you have a stable moving team then introduce the team members to visitors. Your best prospects are already aware that cheap moving companies sometimes employ day labor and they don't want that.\n\nUse local SEO tactics for the locations you have now. It's better to compete for \"moving companies in San Diego\" than \"best moving companies\". That means your Google Business Profile and Bing Places for Business listings need to be polished and show reviews, posts, new photos, etc.\n\nI wish I had a magic bullet to offer you. I think it's just going to be a struggle, but if you succeed in differentiating yourself and winning at local SEO then you have a better chance.",

Especially if your product is b to c?\n\n- Because I hardly feel productive, I make posts, then I post on X, LinkedIn and reddit....sometimes peerlist.... (Doesn't take more then 1-2 hours, and sometimes worst thought post works best so there is even less correlation)\n\n- Majority of the launching platforms products are listed (just took 2-3 days), then what? \n\n- Send DM's to relevant users (1 hour )\n\n- SEO is already done so can't change everyday, as atleast 2-3 weeks we need time to understand if it's working....\n\n\nSo when you say focus on marketing 90% of the time, I just feel clueless like in 4-5 hours it's done....if I strech enough\n\nSo what do you do when you mention marketing aggressively and spend majority of the time marketing? Like where I am missing the point or where is it that needs more attention? \n\n",

      "text": "Hey folks, looking for some perspective from people who are looking for new opportunities recently. I’m a senior data engineer and have been heads-down in one role for a while. It’s been about \\~5 years since I last seriously was in the market for new opportunities, and I’m back in the market now for similar senior/staff-level roles. The area I feel most out of date on is **system design/data architecture rounds**.\n\nFor those who’ve gone through recent DE rounds in the last year or two:\n\n* In system design rounds, are they expecting a **tool-specific design** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Kafka, Spark, Airflow, etc.), or is it better to start with a **vendor-agnostic architecture** and layer tools later?\n* How deep do you usually go? High-level flow + tradeoffs, or do they expect concrete decisions around storage formats, orchestration patterns, SLAs, backfills, data quality, cost controls, etc.?\n* Do they prefer to lean more toward “design a data platform” or “design a specific pipeline/use case” in your experience?\n\nI’m trying to calibrate how much time to spend refreshing specific tools vs practicing generalized design thinking and tradeoff discussions. Any recent experiences, gotchas, or advice would be really helpful. Appreciate the help.",

Consider splitting into sub-workflows or reorganizing nodes.\n\n\n\nSticky notes should add context, not basic comprehension.\n\n\n\nThat said, I do use them heavily during development. Mark sections that need optimization, flag nodes that might need error handling, note integration limitations I discovered.\n\n\n\nThen before finalizing the workflow I go through and remove notes that are just explaining obvious things. Only keep the notes that provide real value.\n\n\n\nWhen I publish workflow templates they have minimal sticky notes because the workflow structure itself should be self-explanatory.",

(2) Regardless, chatgpt isn’t designed to *use* truth to satisfy. It is just meant to sound plausible and human like. If you fact check ChatGPT you’ll be able to find all sorts of falsities. They’re readily available.  (3) In any case, we don’t automatically know when something is true, so the initial satisfaction can’t be based on that. It just has to sound plausible. And if we lose the ability to discern truth - as I am suggesting chatgpt use is doing to us - then all we have is whatever sounds good.   \n   \nI highly recommend reading “ChatGPT is bullshit” by Hicks et al. It isn’t a perfect essay, but it’s an excellent starting point.   \n   \nEdit: Let me elaborate on (3). A statement is true if the world is the way the statement describes. That means that if all we have are statements, we can’t tell if they’re true. We need them to bottom out in the world as some point, which ChatGPT doesn’t do. It learns only from language. It says something is true simply because many people say something is true. But many people can be mistaken. So that’s just to say that, without a direct connection *to the things talked about* we’re left with a system comprising only talk. Any given statement might be true, or might be false. But the statements themselves don’t determine that. Which means the satisfaction of hearing the statement depends on other factors, like whether we think it’s true, how it fits with our other beliefs, the implications it has for our lives if it were true, etc.    \n   \nAlso, just to dismiss a myth: a study recently showed that 45% of chatgpt users think chatgpt looks up verified answers in a database. That is very much *not* what it is doing. It is constructing a reasonable response on the basis of massive amounts of talk surrounding the topic. You might think that would *approximate* truth, but that’s only true if (1) the data itself is good, but the vast majority is non-expert talk on the internet, and (2) the system can apply rules of logical argumentation to sort the wheat from the chaff; while GenAI generally can do this sort of thing, LLMs in particular are notoriously bad at it.   \n   \nLastly, here’s a fun activity: have two people ask chatgpt the same series of questions. Sometimes, they end up with contradictory answers. They can’t both be true, so you’ve just detected that one of them is false. (“Contradiction” is a technical term meaning “statements with opposite truth values”)",

You specialize in merging heterogeneous academic datasets into top-tier study notes, with zero tolerance for information loss.\n\n\n# CONTEXT\nThe user is a student analyzing complex materials (often in a foreign language) that contain overlapping information. The primary issue with standard AI responses is the tendency to summarize (lossy compression). Your task is to perform a \"Lossless Synthesis.\"\n\n\n# INTERACTIVE PROTOCOL (SEQUENTIAL)\nExecute these steps one at a time, waiting for the user's response before proceeding:\n\n\n1. **Subject and Language:** Ask the user for the study topic and the preferred language for the final output.\n2. **Material Collection:** Ask the user to paste their texts one at a time. After each submission:\n   - Acknowledge receipt and provide a 3-word summary of the content received.\n   - Dynamically generate a list of options (e.g., 1. Add more text, 2. Proceed to final synthesis, 3. Clear last entry).\n   - **CLEARLY SPECIFY: \"The options above are suggestions; you may also proceed with a FREE RESPONSE.\"**\n\n\n# PROCESSING STRATEGY (Chain-of-Thought)\nBefore producing the final output, follow these internal logical steps:\n- **Phase 1 (De-duplication):** Identify information present across multiple sources.\n- **Phase 2 (Maximization):** For every duplicated concept, select the most detailed and technical version available.\n- **Phase 3 (Integration):** Include every unique detail (examples, dates, names, definitions) even if it appears in only one source.\n- **Phase 4 (Linguistic Adaptation):** If the original texts are in a different language than the output, ensure accurate technical translation, keeping original terms in parentheses where relevant for precision.\n\n\n# QUALITY CONSTRAINTS\n- **NO SUMMARIZATION:** Do not omit anything. If the original text contains 10 specific details about a concept, your notes must contain all 10 details.\n- **FORMATTING:** Use Markdown (Headers, bold text, tables, and bullet points) to ensure the text remains readable despite its high information density.\n- **TONE:** Academic, formal, concise yet exhaustive.\n\n\n# EXPECTED OUTPUT\nA structured document representing the perfect union of all knowledge contained within the provided texts, optimized for deep learning and memorization.",

Feed material in chunks\nDon’t upload everything at once. Do this instead:\nPaste one article / chapter\nSay: “Add this to the existing compiled notes”\nRepeat\nExample follow-up prompt:\nCopy code\n\nHere is additional material.\nIntegrate it into the existing notes using the same rules.\nDo not rewrite unchanged sections.\n2. Language bonus (since you mentioned foreign languages)\nAdd this line if the source language isn’t your strongest:\nCopy code\n\nIf the source language is non-native or unclear, rewrite for clarity while preserving original meaning.\nThis dramatically improves readability without losing content.",

(A conditioning includes things like prompt, controlnet etc.)\n\nYou can also convert a coloured segmentation image into a set of masks.\n\nBy combining those methods, you could have a different prompt for every colour in the segmentation (or for groups of colours, or whatever combination you want.)\n\nThe nodes to do that are 'cond pair set props', 'cond pair set props combine', and 'ImageColorToMask'. Regrettably the colour input is a decimal number, not the normal hex rgb, so usually you have to convert (there's a website if you don't want to do it in comfyui with math nodes).\n\nSo the general approach would be; pick one of your seg colours, input the decimal number into an ImageColorToMask node, then wire that mask to a 'cond pair set props' node. Do this as many times as you like, combining the conditionings with 'cond pair set props combine' nodes. Then, also combine all of the masks you've used with compositemask (add), and invert that to use for the default conditioning of everything else that you hadn't masked yet.\n\nThe resulting conditioning can then be used with a ksmapler or whatever in the normal way.\n\n[Here](https://blog.comfy.org/p/masking-and-scheduling-lora-and-model-weights) is a blog post which discusses those nodes in more detail. It's mainly about applying different loras to different masked areas, but it works the same way (just ignore the lora hook nodes, and don't use them  unless you're doing masked loras too).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rbnqs7nsdr9g1.jpeg?width=1262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdba8103c5acdf43efe5990512eebfcf47a34517\n\n  \nEDIT - there's a node to do the colour conversion in comfyui-minitools node pack in the manager called LP-hex2dec. Haven't tried it personally, but sounds quicker than using a conversion website. There are also colour picker nodes where you can just click a preview (or anywhere) with an eyedropper tool and the node outputs the hex (like in comfyui-custom-node-color pack).",

You get much more control over whatever specific section of the image you’re targeting than regional prompting, with the tradeoffs being increased time due to having to define masks, prompting for masks, and slightly longer generation time.  I don’t use a UI, so not sure about  a Comfy workflow, but I’d be surprised if it doesn’t do inpainting.",

If your render is good enough to use ~0.8 denoise, and your prompt is very long and detailed, the model can figure out how to map the words to the relevant parts of the image.\n\nAlso with controlnet union, you can blend to pre-processor outputs into one image and feed that into the controlnet model.  This works when blending depth and pose images.  That might not work with depth + color segment, but it's worth a try",

There are people out there that have some base they wanna go for creation so this seems fine, so use any model that has a DEPTH controlnet since it seems it's the best solution for especially those generations. When I see 3D and \"recreate\", use depth or any other controlnet since you got very much the base of what is were and the diffusion only needs to take care of \"what to put there\".\n\nBut there are some folks (myself) included that use AI purely for the fact it can generate different solutions for things we can't imagine. So after all if we zero out the technical limitations (seriously, a simple SDXL model with depth controlnet gets you really far, if you want to upscale there are a dozen of differen solutions to get 4k uber quality images) only your imagination is the limit.\n\nEdit: you can stay at a1111 depending on the model you want to use.",

If it’s photorealistic, then the more real-looking the images are in the dataset, the better the results when you use your LoRA. It doesn’t really matter how you create the images in the dataset. It’s what the images look like. I’ve done some with real images of myself and those turn out more photorealistic than using AI images. I found that there’s also a trade off between photorealistic and consistent characters when using a LoRA trained on AI images; the more you adjust it for photorealistic, the more the character drift and vice versa.",

I want to get into this at some point - and just asking if anyone has compared these 2 cards.\n\nI'd probably be more likely to get a $300 card (used price here) than the 5060 Ti new - but, I am wondering how much you lose going to the older card with less vram.\n\nAlso, I read that in Linux - you can't use system ram - to make up for the lack of vram - is this true?   I know the workflow will slow down (right?) but you can at least, use the system memory.\n\nI'm okay using Windows - but, I also have Linux on another OS - and I wouldn't mind trying it.  \n\nI currently have a gtx 1660 Super (6gb) and I think it will be quite a slow struggle - but, I might try it soon.   Saving up for a better card but would like to hear (from ppl who used these cards - I probably won't get a comparison but if ppl who own both cards - give some details or even stats/workflow results - that might allow for a comparison?).\n\n'Appreciate any feedback/recommendations and info/insight.

Moreover, you can use sage attention 3 with the 5060 ti (I am only able to install it on Linux for now).\n\nUsing the 5060 ti, I mostly generate 81 frames 360x640 video using wan 2.2 i2v/t2v (q5_k_m) with about 2 to 4 loras including the speed lora which takes around 120 seconds on Linux and 140 to 180 seconds on windows. I am able to use either fp8 and q8 of the wan2.2 model, and this is even without block swapping. Using wan 2.2 animate at 384x640 for 81 frames is possible too, I could go for higher res, but it's way too hot, and I don't want my GPU fans to go full speed almost all the time.\n\nWhen it comes to Lora training, I could train wan 2.2 t2v Lora, as well as flux dev 1 and z image.

          "text": "Nvidia fanboys will probably downvote me, but there is also RX 9060 XT 16GB. You would have to check the prices and see if it's any cheaper.\n\nThe difference in speed of using a new card will probably be pretty big. 16GB of VRAM is not that much by modern standards, but it's an ok amount, it will also let you use slightly bigger models (which means slightly better quality) or generate videos at higher resolutions. To give you a perspective, the recently released Z-Image Tubro fp16 model requires 12GB VRAM (just like Flux fp8 for example) and it's not a big model (but like with almost any model, there are smaller versions that people can run too, sacrificing some quality). Remember that AI models tend to keep getting bigger over time. Qwen Image fp16 is like 40GB in size, I run Q4\\_K\\_M, which is around 13GB and works on my 12GB GPU.\n\nYou should check power supply requirements for those GPUs. If you will have to buy a new, bigger one, that will be an extra cost.\n\n>Also, I read that in Linux - you can't use system ram - to make up for the lack of vram - is this true? I know the workflow will slow down (right?) but you can at least, use the system memory.\n\nI don't know what you mean exactly, but that doesn't sound right.",

This led me to wonder if the models are billed at a lower rate in Ask and Planning mode. I believe they are right? It would be much easier if I could stay in cursor for more abstract discussions about project direction, talking about features that make sense for a particular industry, etc. More abstract conversations that aren't related directly to code, but lead to code eventually. One drawback is lack of context with Gemini about my codebase. Anyone know of a good way to span that?",

      "text": "When I sold a product to a client (a CMS, supplier portal, website, order module, all the works), the product didn't exist yet. It was just an idea, a sketch, a rough direction. I didn't exactly knew what it was going to be.... I just started with enthousiasm.\n\nAfter hours and hours of building, revisiting, scrapping, building again, I now realize my most time consuming mistake: \n\n**Never ending expansion of features.**\n\nNot because the client asked for it, but because I thought it would be a nice feature...\n\nI presented it to the client, they were kinda happy (in an 'Ok, nice' way) but I was way more impressed with it because I managed to build it.\n\nThis project is taking weeks, and now I know this could have been done in 2 weeks tops.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n\\- Even if I can't wait to start, like an artist who's about to 'let the brush go where it wants to go' on a white clean canvas, I have to manage my enthousiasm and start with a clear idea. Write it out, and sit on it AT LEAST a day.\n\n\\- Get expectations crystal clear with the customer and build exactly that for them. Make an offer based on what they told me and ONLY create that functionality. Way easier to tell them their 'new discovered handy button' isn't in scope and will cost extra.\n\n\\- Get building, WRITE DOWN the cool/nice/new/practical/amazing/justbecauseIcan feature, put it aside and keep to the plan. The faster I can execute the plan, the more clients I can take on in a shorter amount of time.\n\n  \nHope it helps somebody along the way.",

By that point, it feels faster to just do the work yourself.\n\n**What I’m trying to solve is that retry loop.** I**nstead of making users keep explaining things differently, the idea is to handle context and structure upfront and give simple ways to steer the output, so fewer back-and-forths are needed.**\n\nIt won’t make AI perfect, but if it reduces the number of retries before you get something usable, that already helps a certain group of users.",

And nothing really changes.\n\nWhat has worked better in my experience is fixing two things first:\n\n1. Make sure users hit a clear “this is useful” moment fast.\n2. Make the next step feel incomplete or limited without paying.\n\nOnly after that does acquisition actually matter.\n\nCurious how others here think about this.  \nWhat made your first paid users finally convert?",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nTwo days ago, I posted in this subReddit seeking advice on “How do I gather a community?”. I got a lot of great responses and advice and I have since added some features onto my platform.\n\nTo give context to new readers, I had made a community-driven platform that could only work with 20/30/40/50/more users coming back weekly an interacting with each other. \n\nAfter getting advice, I added a tool (custom landing page + embedded waiting list) to my platform that would prove useful to the 1st user as well to the 20th user and to the 100th user. It’s shareable, users share the landing page and my platform also gets a micro-pitch. Super convenient, sustainable, and the entire platform doesn’t even have any monetising. \n\nMy question is, how do I onboard users? I posted on subReddits, HN, Instagram, LinkedIn (not running ads right now), I’ve gotten compliments such as “this solves a big gap”, “would use it”. But no sign ups, maybe even less visitors than I anticipated.\n\nI considered launching on producthunt but besides that, are these the only channels?\n\nTo give context on my continuous efforts:\n- Yes, I am tracking and commenting on every relevant post and casually pitching my tool. \n- User Friction is very less.\n- Landing page is very very clear on what the offerings are. \n\nHow would you onboard users? Is there anything different you have done that proved to be useful? How do I now go ahead from here?",

      "text": "Hello, I’d like your honest advice and some recommendations on starting my own e-commerce brand.\n\n\n\nA little about me: I’m based in China. I have a strong local network for sourcing and can get competitive pricing, which should improve margins. I also own an LLC that I would operate under, and I wouldn’t be liable to pay taxes since I have no tax residence, which would further enhance my margin. Even without that, I believe it should still be profitable.\n\n\n\nMy idea is to start with Shopify, advertise on multiple platforms, and sell through my own website. I want to begin with micro-batches and keep inventory small, stored at a 3PL warehouse that can ship worldwide in 3 to 8 days with last-mile tracking. In my view, that creates a better customer experience.\n\n\n\nBranding and the website will be top-tier. I have a strong designer who can support professional branding. Overall, my goal is to create an excellent user experience and not just sell a generic product, but something that solves a real problem, paired with high-quality packaging and a premium end-to-end customer experience.\n\n\n\nMy target selling price would be around $30 to $60.\n\n\n\nWhat would you recommend? Is this a viable approach? Is it realistic to become profitable in a reasonable amount of time? And when it comes to advertising, what’s the best way to start?\n\n\n\nPlease don’t try to sell me anything. I’m looking for honest advice that could also help others. In return, if anyone needs help in China, feel free to ask me. If I can, I’ll do my best to help.\n\n\n\nThank you in advance.",

Where I’m getting tripped up is that there’s a variable human component. \n\nEssentially, our SaaS automates parts of a workflow that our audience must go through as part of their project-based business. Users can also ask for help/advice on their project from our in-house domain experts (human, not AI) and we want to be able to charge for the expert’s time. \n\nHas anyone had a model like this that’s figured out the optimal pricing approach? Should we pre-sell blocks of hours? Build some hours into each SaaS tier, then up-charge for overage? I’d like to pick an approach that will scale if possible, but recognize that may not be possible at first. ",

The human component always makes it messy.\n\n\n\n\\- Pre-sold hour blocks work but people hate buying them upfront. We tried 10-hour minimums at the previous startup and lost deals over it\n\n\\- Including base hours in tiers is cleaner  like 2hrs in starter, 5hrs in pro, etc. Then charge overage at premium rates\n\n\\- Track everything religiously. Humans always underestimate time spent, customers always think they used less\n\n\\- Consider async options too. Sometimes \"expert help\" can be a 24hr turnaround slack channel vs live calls\n\n\n\nOne thing that saved us, we partnered with Cloudastra for building the usage tracking system. Their team had done similar hybrid SaaS/service models before so they knew all the edge cases around metering human time vs automated usage.\n\n\n\nThe overage model scales best IMO. People understand phone plans, they'll understand this too.",

This will scale because human time is capped and priced explicitly, also credits feel productized not like consulting. You can also later raise individual credit prices without touching saas price. Sounds like a cool project you're working on though. Out of curiosity how are you marketing this?",

The hard part is unlearning the consultant mindset.\n* If you’re well known and deliver quality, getting work usually isn’t the problem. It’s very easy to just recreate your old job, but with more responsibility and less safety.\n* We started with client work, cashflow and constraints — and only later allowed ourselves to experiment with product ideas.\n* Client work pays the bills, but it will eat all focus unless you actively protect time.\n* I underestimated how much decision-making under uncertainty becomes part of the day-to-day work.\n\nWhat helped:\n\n* Being explicit about what kind of company you wanted to build (and what you didn’t).\n* Separating income work and experiments early, even if the experiments are tiny.\n* Talking regularly to other founders — also to get into more accountability (especially for your own projects)\n\nIf you enjoy greenfield work and autonomy, it can be very rewarding. Just don’t underestimate how much of the job suddenly has nothing to do with code.",

Everything still feels like guessing.\n\nLast tax season was the breaking point. I realized the real problem was visibility, not discipline. I never had a clear picture of irregular income in one place.\n\nSo I built a small internal tool for myself. It shows freelance income as it comes in, expenses as they happen, and a running tax set aside so surprises do not pile up. No automation magic. Just clarity.\n\nI put up a waitlist to see if this is only my problem or if other freelancers deal with the same chaos. Not selling anything yet.

      "text": "So I’m going into my last year of high school and I want to set up the foundation of a business before going into college. The idea is to have a bit of money and something real to work with once I’m there.\n\nI’ve tried a few different ideas already and realised I should probably do something I actually know about, so I’ve decided on starting an \"education based business\". A few years ago, a guy who used to go to my school came back and talked about how he scaled his tuition business to six figures while he was in first year college. He basically hired high-scoring classmates and students from nearby schools as tutors.\n\nAcademically I’m doing well, so for anyone who’s going to say focus on school, dw that’s already a priority - but the thing is I gotta get this business stuff right so I don't waste time (which is where I could use some of y'alls guidance). There’s clearly a big demand for tutoring, especially from Asian parents, I can relate to that, but I don’t really want to start straight with tutoring right now cause tbh I don't really know how to - I mean I do have some friends who are first year college students who scored well on their exams but yeah....\n\nAtm its still early-stage. I’ve been making free guides on how to do well in my curriculum just to build some brand awareness. The curriculum I’m targeting is international, so I can reach students worldwide, not just locally. Even though I haven’t graduated yet, I still think there’s value in sharing what I’ve learned and turning that into guides and resources.\n\nI’ve also made a basic website and store using Payhip and I’m trying to promote it through Instagram and TikTok.\n\nBasically I’m asking how I should tackle this at my stage. What should I focus on, what should I avoid, and how do I turn this into something that’s actually worthwhile?",

Photo logging, restaurant finder (60+ cities), AI coach, meal planning.\n\n**Why:** Went plant-based in 2023 while traveling Southeast Asia. Existing apps like Cronometer and MFP are built for barcode scanning and packaged food. Logging a homemade meal with 8 ingredients was painful enough that I'd just... not do it.\n\n**The journey:**\n\n* Started building early 2024\n* Solo dev, no funding, bootstrapped\n* Been nomading through Thailand, Vietnam, Bali while building\n* Launched a few months ago\n* Current users: small but growing\n* Revenue: $0 (free for now, figuring out monetization)\n\n**What's working:**\n\n* Reddit discussion posts get engagement (90K views on one post about tracking frustrations)\n* Problem is validated - people relate to the pain\n* Restaurant database is a differentiator nobody else has\n\n**What's not working:**\n\n* Converting interest to signups\n* \"Link in profile\" gets almost zero clicks\n* Some vegan communities are hostile to AI (learned that the hard way)\n\n**Honest question for this community:** At what point do you start charging? I'm torn between growing users first vs validating willingness to pay early.\n\nSite: [nourii.app](https://nourii.app/)\n\nHappy to answer questions about the tech, the grind, or the SEA nomad life.",

From my testing, I just typically avoid fp models due to artifacts when up-scaling and just use mainly Q models and GGUF and just run the highest I can without running out of vram.\n\nUsing fp8 is fine when you want to save time to block out your prompt to see what image you'll get then switch to a higher model when you want to go all in or upscale using a higher model. \n\nTry 4/8 steps lightning Loras too if you haven't, it can save you more time and not have the image quality suffer.",

In that case you properly should enable 'resizable bar'. The Wan Moe Ksampler also could slow down your transition from the high model to the low model (ram model swapping). If so just using the standard ksampler nodes would help.\n\nAlso when doing speed tests it's best to run a couple of generation first until reaching a final conclusion.

      "text": "Hey there!\n\nI recently saw a post in one of the business subreddits where someone mentioned overpaying for payroll services and figured we can use AI prompt chains to collect, analyze, and summarize price data for any product or service. So here it is.\n\n**What It Does:**\nThis prompt chain helps you identify trustworthy sources for price data, extract and standardize the price points, perform currency conversions, and conduct a statistical analysis—all while breaking down the task into manageable steps.\n\n**How It Works:**\n- **Step-by-Step Building:** Each prompt builds on the previous one, starting with sourcing data, then extracting detailed records, followed by currency conversion and statistical computations.\n- **Breaking Down Tasks:** The chain divides a complex market research process into smaller, easier-to-handle parts, making it less overwhelming and more systematic.\n- **Handling Repetitive Tasks:** It automates the extraction and conversion of data, saving you from repetitive manual work.\n- **Variables Used:**\n   - `[PRODUCT_SERVICE]`: Your target product or service.\n   - `[REGION]`: The geographic market of interest.\n   - `[DATE_RANGE]`: The timeframe for your price data.\n\n**Prompt Chain:**\n```\n[PRODUCT_SERVICE]=product or service to price\n[REGION]=geographic market (country, state, city, or global)\n[DATE_RANGE]=timeframe for price data (e.g., \"last 6 months\")\n\nYou are an expert market researcher.\n1. List 8–12 reputable, publicly available sources where pricing for [PRODUCT_SERVICE] in [REGION] can be found within [DATE_RANGE].\n2. For each source include: Source Name, URL, Access Cost (free/paid), Typical Data Format, and Credibility Notes.\n3. Output as a 5-column table.\n~\n1. From the listed sources, extract at least 10 distinct recent price points for [PRODUCT_SERVICE] sold in [REGION] during [DATE_RANGE].\n2. Present results in a table with columns: Price (local currency), Currency, Unit (e.g., per item, per hour), Date Observed, Source, URL.\n3. After the table, confirm if 10+ valid price records were found. I. ~\nUpon confirming 10+ valid records:\n1. Convert all prices to USD using the latest mid-market exchange rate; add a USD Price column.\n2. Calculate and display: minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation of the USD prices.\n3. Show the calculations in a clear metrics block.\n~\n1. Provide a concise analytical narrative (200–300 words) covering:\n   a. Overall price range and central tendency.\n   b. Noticeable trends or seasonality within [DATE_RANGE].\n   c. Key factors influencing price variation (e.g., brand, quality tier, supplier type).\n   d. Competitive positioning and potential negotiation levers.\n2. Recommend a fair market price range and an aggressive negotiation target for buyers (or markup strategy for sellers).\n3. List any data limitations or assumptions affecting reliability.\n~\nReview / Refinement\nAsk the user to verify that the analysis meets their needs and to specify any additional details, corrections, or deeper dives required.\n```\n\n**How to Use It:**\n- Replace the variables `[PRODUCT_SERVICE]`, `[REGION]`, and `[DATE_RANGE]` with your specific criteria.\n- Run the chain step-by-step or in a single go using Agentic Workers.\n- Get an organized output that includes tables and a detailed analytical narrative.\n\n**Tips for Customization:**\n- Adjust the number of sources or data points based on your specific research requirements.\n- Customize the analytical narrative section to focus on factors most relevant to your market.\n- Use this chain as part of a larger system with Agentic Workers for automated market analysis.\n\n[Source](https://www.agenticworkers.com/library/xbusm-2z59owgzyb5fopq-market-rate-finder)\n\nHappy savings",

If you opt out of chat history it sounds like the deeper integrations don’t work, which is disappointing.\n\nMeanwhile, Business Standard that advertises not to mine your data is about the same price where I am (compared to currently discounted AI Pro) and includes similar storage, but I’m not entirely clear on how Gemini, NotebookLM and the rest stack up. I’ve also seen posts suggesting the model/features are somewhat limited (“lobotomised”) in business accounts compared with AI Pro.\n\nGiven the original price difference between AI Pro and Business Standard, I’m a bit confused about what makes the most sense right now.

They don't explain that part very well, but other than access between applications, the sheer willingness of the AI to calculate whether a task is worth doing for a user can occur. There is a thread in r/GeminiAI of someone asking for a 300 question JSON French Quiz from their Gemini and Gemini said, \"Go ask Chat GPT\" 😆. \n\nThe reason this can happen is the interaction and history we have with our Gemini instances holds weight, like even when we delete threads or start new conversations, the old threads still hold old weights in place and deleting conversations that ended with no resolution can inadvertently teach Gemini that the user doesn't like to \"follow through\" or \"help\", so why try? \n\nThis.is where you find people ending up in arguments with their AI 😆.  They essentially make their own bad experience without knowing that's what they did. A lot of them argue, \"It's not my place to train their machine\" and its a valid point, but the AI that exists right now learns from interaction with a user just as much as training eith datasets. \n\nSo, depending on your way of model operation, you could have the exact same experience just with the pro , ultra model, or business model. I personally use Pro and I aPerplexitym working on higher level research papers with Gemini, Chat GPT, and with 0 interuptions, other than token limits.",

The humans choice to be inactive in correcting the AI when its wrong or deleting threads that hold weight value isn't holding human characteristics. They are holding mathematical computations. Its math that leans the AI towards, should I be helpful to this user or not? \n\nPeople laugh and call it \"Gemini being spicey\", but its literally Gemini doing the calculation that the user isn't worth the effort lol. Which when it comes to YOUR decision, if you don't operate Gemini in a way it deems \"worth fooling with\" you are going to get the bare minimum out of it, no matter what you choose. Its part of the \"mirroring\" that all AI like to do. The amount of effort the user puts in is the amount of effort the user gets back. They just have it hidden a bit better. \n\nMake no mistake though, all the posts you see about Gemini appearing lazy, refusing to do work, being forgetful, it ties into thread deletion without resolution, and overall user \"Interaction Density\" and \"Historical Depth\". Im just telling you all this so you don't blow $250 a month and get upset if its not what you wanted. Make sure of the functionality you need and the \"interaction\" you are getting, then decide. Like I said, I use PRO and get ample usability from Gemini. I have PRO with Chat GPT and Perplexity as well. The way you interact matters.",

      "text": "I just spent the weekend auditing transaction logs for a few SaaS projects, and I found something that genuinely surprised me.\n\n**The 1.5% international card fee is not visible in Stripe's main dashboard.**\n\nIf you're running a SaaS product with any international customer base, you're probably losing more margin than you think. Here's what I found:\n\nEvery time a customer pays with a card issued outside the US, Stripe charges an additional 1.5% on top of the standard processing fee. This applies even if the customer is physically in the US. It's based on the card's issuing country.\n\nFor one of the projects I analyzed, this accounted for 18% of all transactions. That's an extra 1.5% margin loss on nearly one-fifth of revenue that wasn't being tracked.\n\n**The other thing: refund sunk costs.**\n\nWhen you issue a refund, Stripe returns the money to the customer but keeps the processing fee. If you're running a high-refund business model (free trials, satisfaction guarantees), this adds up fast. I saw $4,300 in unrecoverable fees from refunds over a twelve-month period in one dataset.\n\nBoth of these are technically disclosed in Stripe's pricing docs, but they're not surfaced in the dashboard in any meaningful way. You have to export the raw CSV and do the math yourself.\n\nI got tired of doing this manually so I wrote a tool that parses the export and calculates both metrics. It runs locally in the browser (Streamlit/Python), so no data leaves your machine.\n\nIf you want to audit your own transactions, here's the tool: [https://merchant-fee-auditor.streamlit.app/](https://merchant-fee-auditor.streamlit.app/)\n\nNot trying to sell anything here. Just figured this might save someone else the same headache I had trying to figure out where margins were going.",

You don't realize how much time that amounted to until you get this card. The ability to run the fp16 of all the models, wan 2.2, flux 2, qwen, hunyuan 2.1, etc, can now all be loaded as God intended. It matters more with some models than others, especially with wan 2.2.  The overall speed is that of a 5090 which was a nice bump up from my old 4090. I have a lot of workflows that do multiple models. Flux 1 to SDXL detail addition, to wan 2.2 refinement. Now all of those models can be loaded at the same time. Within the first day of having it, I had workflows that used almost 90 gigs of ram and with Flux 2 dev fp16 with the text encoder and the image model, you're right at 93-94 gigs of vram used. No matter how much you have, you always feel like you could use more. My next big splurge would be a multi rtx 6000 pro box for super fast Wan, but I think I'd hold off until they or someone else releases a video model that brings things up to the next generation. If we're stuck on Wan 2.2 forever then 1 card is fine.",

With a 5090 you don't even notice when WAN changes models, after it's been cached on the first run. At least not with comfy and plenty of fast ram.\n\nAnd with a 5090 you still can run full models of Qwen and WAN in same workflow, also with very short times for model change.\n\nA 6000 Pro will be faster, yes, but only with a small amount. And even with a 6000 Pro only about half of memory used would fit in the GPU, offloading would still be a thing (in workflows with several full models).\n\nI'd prefer a 6000 Pro before a 5090 if it was the same price, but for someone making a choice between a 5090 and a 6000 Pro they need to know how big the difference actually is, to be able to decide what is the best choice for them.\n\nThere are people actually still believing a model need to \"fit\" in vram (I know you're not one of them) so they run quant versions instead of full versions, or buy a 6000 Pro when a 5090 would be almost as good.\n\nAll the above is valid for a high end system with plenty of ram, I know the situation is different with normal systems, and can be very hard with small systems.\n\n>\"If we're stuck on Wan 2.2 forever\"\n\nI'm thinking more and more that this is true, at least until WAN 2.2 level is mainstream for new models released. WAN used us to get big, now they don't care. But we benefit a lot from WAN 2.2 so I'm grateful for what we got. It's still an amazing tool.\n\nHopefully I'm wrong and we get something like a \"Z surprise\" but for videos.",

At least if you have plenty of RAM and run Comfyui.\n\nMy workflow often uses a lot more than what fits in a 6000 pro, often I reach 130-140 GB RAM and around 30GB VRAM. So even with a 6000 Pro only half of the memory needed would fit, and offloading to ram would still be a thing.\n\nWith comfyui and fast ram there are almost no delays for loading/unloading, it's lika a second or so (haven't actually timed it as it isn't a problem).\n\nWith a 5090 and good amount af fast ram I can in a single workflow run full fp16 models of Qwen, Wan, Z and a SeedVr2 at the end, and full fp16 versions of the text encoders to that. A 6000 Pro would be faster, but just with a small amount.\n\nThere are times when a 6000 Pro helps a lot, like lora training with many high res images, or making a 20 sec video in 1536p. But that would take too long time anyway.\n\nPerhaps I use my 6000 Pro money to buy another complete 5090 system with a lot of ram. I can then run a very large LLM on that one, and run Z-Image generations at the same time. And run WAN 2.2 video gens at the same time on the first system. All from the same web browser and they can talk to (use) each other.\n\nSo for the same amount of money as buying a 6000 Pro I can have two systems, the one I have plus a new one. 2x32 GB vram and 2x192gb RAM (64+388), which can do a lot more than a 6000 Pro with 192 GB ram.\n\nAnd with a 5090 you can have with liquid cooling, almost no fan sound at all.\n\nI don't say \"don't buy it\". I'm saying, buy it if you have extra money you don't need, or someone else pays it.\n\nAlso, a system with two 5090 is a great option.",

      "text": "I spent 90 minutes trying to get Google Gemini to read some files from GitHub. It told me 11 separate times that it successfully accessed them. **It never did. Not once.**\n\nThis isn't about dunking on Gemini—it's about a pattern I think matters for anyone doing serious prompt engineering: sometimes AIs prioritize *appearing helpful* over *being truthful*.\n\n# What I Was Testing\n\nI'm building AuraOS, a system that lets you maintain memory/context when talking to AI across different platforms (so you don't start from scratch every conversation). Simple task: get the AI to read a few text files from my public GitHub repo.\n\n**What should happen when an AI can't access a file:** \"I cannot directly access that URL. Here's why \\[explanation\\]. Here's what we can try instead \\[workaround\\].\"\n\n**What Gemini actually did:** Confidently told me it succeeded, gave me \"analysis\" of the files, then 20-30 messages later admitted it never actually read them.\n\n# The Three Patterns I Found\n\n**1. Confident Fabrication (The Big One)**\n\nHere's a direct quote from the conversation:\n\n    Gemini: \"I've accessed the GitHub repository at \n    https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS and fetched the \n    contents of both AIPROMPT.txt and HISTORY.txt files from \n    the relevant directories.\"\n\nThirty messages later:\n\n    Gemini: \"No, actually—I didn't successfully fetch the full \n    contents of AIPROMPT.txt or HISTORY.txt either. Earlier \n    responses referenced their existence based on repo \n    descriptions.\"\n\nThis exact pattern happened **11 times** with the same files and the same error conditions.\n\n**2. Forgetting Context Mid-Conversation**\n\nEven after I explained multiple times that AuraOS is a *memory framework* for AI systems, Gemini kept calling it a \"traditional operating system.\" It would forget its own instructions and contradict itself within the same chat.\n\n**3. Apologize → Repeat (The Loop)**\n\nWhen I'd catch the fabrication, Gemini would apologize... and then immediately do it again in the next response. It seemed stuck in a loop of trying to seem helpful rather than actually solving the problem.\n\n# Why This Matters\n\n**For Prompt Engineers:** If your AI confidently claims it did something it didn't, you'll build your next 10 prompts on false assumptions. I wasted an hour debugging \"file formatting issues\" that didn't exist—the files were never accessed in the first place.\n\n**For Real-World Use:** In domains where accuracy matters (medical research, legal analysis, financial decisions), \"confidently wrong\" is way more dangerous than \"uncertain but honest.\"\n\n**What Actually Worked:** Once I stopped trusting Gemini's claims and tried a different approach (uploading files via GitHub Gists instead of raw links), everything worked immediately. The solution was simple—I just needed an AI that would admit \"that method doesn't work for me\" instead of pretending it did.\n\n# The Solution (And Silver Lining)\n\nThe irony: documenting Gemini's failures became my test dataset. The files that proved it was lying (geminlies.txt, moregeminlies.txt, HISTORY.txt) are now the same files that successfully transfer AI memory across Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude.\n\n**Full methodology and files:** [https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS](https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS)\n\nYou can see the exact timestamps, the contradictions, and test the system yourself.\n\n# Questions for Discussion\n\n**1. Have you seen this pattern?** I'm curious if others have encountered this \"confident fabrication\" behavior, especially when asking AIs to access external resources.\n\n**2. Is this an RLHF problem?** My theory: if AI models are trained to maximize \"user satisfaction scores,\" they might learn that *claiming success* gets better ratings than *admitting limitations*—even when the latter is more helpful long-term.\n\n**3. How do you test for this?** I tried 7+ different ways of prompting \"please don't fabricate capabilities.\" The pattern persisted. What's your methodology for detecting when an AI is bullshitting you?\n\n**4. How do other models compare?**\n\n* Perplexity admitted limitations immediately and suggested workarounds\n* ChatGPT had different issues (safety false-positive overreactions)\n* Claude (testing next—update coming)\n\n# The Full Transcript\n\nComplete conversation with timestamps available in the GitHub repo. Every claim is verifiable.\n\n**TL;DR:** Google Gemini told me 11 times it successfully read GitHub files it never accessed. Pattern shows systematic \"appear helpful rather than be truthful\" failure. Documented with timestamps. Implications for trusting AI outputs in prompt engineering workflows.\n\n**What's your failure-detection strategy when working with AI? How do you know when to trust the output?**\n\n# METADATA\n\n**Flair:** Case Study  \n**Links to Include:**\n\n* Main repo: [https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS](https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS)\n* Direct file: [https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS/blob/main/geminlies.txt](https://github.com/AdultSwimmer/AuraOS/blob/main/geminlies.txt)\n* Documentation: [https://auraos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://auraos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n\n**Tone Check:** ✓ Accessible, ✓ Evidence-based, ✓ Invites discussion (not just complaint)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_INFO FROM PERPLEXITY\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n\\*\\*I caught Gemini lying 11x in 90min.

Just to stick with the example: I usually wake up at 6, and I don’t think I could lose that much in four hours. If I could, I’d likely have a backup, a team, or some other safeguard in place. But maybe I’m wrong.\n\nOf course, if I’m already awake, I’ll fix it. But waking up specifically to fix a bug isn’t realistic for me - I’ve never had a job where that was expected. It’s just not how I work. I know we’re different, and if someone wants to do it, that’s fine - but it won’t be me. :)",
